# Interrogation of Fr. Stan Swamy on Bhima-Koregoan Case by the National Investigation Agency

I am Stan Swamy, a Jesuit Priest, aged 83 years, from Jamshedpur
Province in Jharkhand state of India, and a Human Right Activist,
especially defending the constitutional and human rights of _Adivasis_
(India's indigenous peoples), for the last 40 years. I was the Director,
a trainer and an activist at the Indian Social Institute, Bangalore for
several years. Later, I moved to Jharkhand and was associated with the
JOHAR (Jharkhandi Organization for Human Rights) at Chaibasa for
a few years. Then I moved to Ranchi, the capital of Jharkhand state,
and founded _Bagaicha_, a Jesuit social research and training centre at
Namkum, Ranchi. I have been active at _Bagaicha_ for the last 15 years.
I have been working in collaboration with people's movements that
were working against unjust displacement, human rights violations,
illegal land acquisitions, and policies that were designed or amended
to acquire more land, making the indigenous people landless. I have
been writing and supporting the struggles for the implementation of
the Fifth Schedule of the Indian Constitutions, implementation of
the provisions of _Panchayats_ Extension to Scheduled Areas (PESA)
Act, 1996 and the Samatha Judgment by the Supreme Court of
India, and promoted the concept of 'Owner of the land will be
the owners of Minerals therein'. Recently, I facilitated a research on
the under-trial prisoners in Jharkhand. Based on the findings of the
research, a PIL was filed at the Jharkhand High Court, WPC (PIL)
No 4212 of 2017, praying for the release of about 4,000 tribal youth
languishing in various prisons of Jharkhand.

As a strange surprise, on 28 August 2018, my room in _Bagaicha_ was
raided by Pune Police saying that my name had appeared in an FIR in
the riot case at Bhima-Koregaon,[^/17] along with eleven others. During
this raid, my laptop, mobile phone, a few CDs, documents and files
were confiscated by the Pune Police. Meanwhile, I was getting news
that a few other well-known and committed social activists, human
right lawyers and writers too have been subjected to raids and
imprisonment for the past two years, without framing of charges,
a step that precedes trial of a criminal case, all in relation to
Bhima-Koregaon riot case. After about 10 months, since the first
raid of my room, once again my room was raided, on 12 June 2019.
In this instance too, the hard disk (internal memory) of my computer,
mobile phone, my email and social media accounts were confiscated.

[^/17]: Bhima-Koregaon is a place in Maharashtra near Pune where
the _Dalits_ (former untouchables of India) gathered in big
numbers on 1 January 2018 to celebrate the 200th anniversary
of a battle in which _Dalits_ fought against the rulers. During
this celebration, sudden violence erupted. The instigation of
this violence is attributed to the upper caste right-wing forces
which wanted to scuttle the celebrations. The _Dalits_ filed an FIR
in the Pune Rural police, which had jurisdiction over BhimaKoregaon;
Another FIR was filed with the PUNE city Police
which was taken cognizance immediately leading to the raids and
arrests of Human right Defenders. For more on the incident and
the case please visit: [https://www.thequint.com/explainers/what-was-bhima-koregaon-battle-explainer](https://www.thequint.com/explainers/what-was-bhima-koregaon-battle-explainer).

In the meantime, in Jharkhand, the government headed by the BJP,
filed an FIR against me and 19 other activists based on a Facebook
posts relating to _Pathalgadi_[^/18] movement in Khunti district, Jharkhand
(CC.No 124 of 2018, dated 26.07.2018). The FIR accuses us of
inciting violence through Facebook posts during the _Pathalgadi_
movement. Though this FIR was filed in the month of July 2018,
it was never pursued. But, suddenly in the month of July 2019, it
was activated, after the second raid in my room by the Pune police.
Since the case against us was merely based on our Facebook posts,
we appealed to the Jharkhand Hight Court to quash the case against
us (Cr.M.P No 3183 of 2018). However, the Khunti police have
submitted an annexure, received from the Pune police, to Jharkhand
High Court to support the Khunti police's allegations against me.
This annexure contains materials to the effect that I was one of
the accused in Bhima-Koregaon case. To my surprise, during the
hearing in the High Court, the Advocate General referred to me
as a 'dreaded criminal'. Such actions reveal collusion between
the BJP governments, in both Jharkhand and Maharashtra to
bring about the confluence of both cases. In the meantime, the
Khunti Court had issued a non-bailable arrest warrant against me.
The Police in Khunti conducted the "attachment of property" in the
month of October 2019; it took away two tables, a steel shelf, three
plastic chairs, a mattress, and a pillow! The Jharkhand High Court, on
6 December 2019, declared that proper procedures were not followed
as per Code of Criminal Procedure. When the non-BJP government
in Jharkhand was formed by the end of December 2019, it announced
that it is withdrawing all cases relating to _Pathalgadi_. The procedures
for the same have not yet been completed.

[^/18]: _Pathalgadi_ is a traditional and ceremonial erecting of a stoneslab
by the Mundari-speaking _Adivasi_/indigenous people in
remembrance of their ancestors, who have lived their lives and
died in commitment to their cultural values and ideology. In
recent years, due to increasing displacement, deprivation and
violation of indigenous peoples' constitutional rights, _Adivasis_/
indigenous peoples have started using _Pathalgadi_ to inscribe their
constitutionally guaranteed rights on these stone slabs and
erect them at the entrance of their village boundaries. The
BJP-led government in Jharkhand has depicted this practice
of the indigenous peoples or _Adivasis_ as '_anti-national_'
and deployed para-military forces to violently suppress this
movement in villages at Khunti district of Jharkhand. Several
(20) activists who expressed their concern on the Facebook,
over the state repression on indigenous people in relation to
115_Pathalgadi_ movement, have been implicated in a sedition case
by the Jharkhand police. This is, in brief, the _Pathalgadi_ case. For more on _Pathalgadi_ movement: [https://thewire.in/rights/_Pathalgadi_-is-nothing-but-constitutional-messianism-so-why-is-the-bjp-afraid-of-it](https://thewire.in/rights/_Pathalgadi_-is-nothing-but-constitutional-messianism-so-why-is-the-bjp-afraid-of-it).

The new non-BJP coalition government in Maharashtra had ordered
the Maharashtra police to review and speed up investigation and trial
of Bhima-Koregaon riot case. On 1 January 2020, a top leader of
the National Congress Party, a coalition partner, commented that
the Bhima-Koregaon case was baseless and should be withdrawn.
However, the BJP government at the centre intervened and forced
the Maharashtra government to handover the case to the National
Investigation Agency (NIA). Once the NIA has taken over the case,
there has been widespread arrests of intellectuals and raids at the
homes of top human right activists, professors and lawyers. The NIA
has been interrogating more and more committed citizens in various
parts of the country. The period of their interrogation ranges from
three to six months.

The following is a detailed and date-wise documentation of the
interrogation done with me, by an NIA investigating officer at my
residence from 25 July 2020 onwards. I was interrogated in detail by
NIA on 27, 28, 29, 30 of July and on 6 August 2020. So far, a total of
about 15 hours sessions were gruelling. On 27 July, on the first day the
questioning by a one-man team from 1 PM to 3 PM, allowed me to
have lunch only at 3.00 PM. The following day interrogation went
on for five hours with a 45 minutes break for lunch and rest.
On 29 July, again the interrogation was for 3 hours and the following
day, the session lasted for two hours.

## On 25 July 2020

Following is the text written by Fr. David Solomon, the Director
of _Bagaicha_, who actually first received the visitor of National
Investigation Agency:

"On 25 July 2020, two men landed up in _Bagaicha_. A person was
asking for Fr. Stan Swamy from Ms. Sugia Horo, one of the office
staff. She told him to give his name and address and the place he
is coming from. He refused to give. He was insistent that he meets
Stan. Our office staff kept asking the two persons to give their names
and one of them began raising his voice to tell her to call Stan. I
was listening to their conversations from my office. As the staff kept
insisting and the guest was not relenting in giving the information,
I asked the staff to send the two men to my office. As soon as they
landed up, one of them asked me, "Where is Mr. Stan?" I asked him,
"Who are you?". He did not reply to me properly. I told him, "Please
be seated". He sat down. Then in an arrogant manner told me, to
call Stan; I got up to go and then I asked him, 'Please show me your
credentials'. Then he took out an identity card hanging around his
neck and showed me, in which the name Diwarkar Mishra, NIA was
written. I asked the other person too, to show the identity card, from
which I remember the name as, Chandan.

Thereafter, I took both of them to a place where chairs and a table are
placed in a common place. I, then, went to Stan's room and told him
that an NIA officer has arrived. He got up calmly and began moving.
I stood and took up my phone to ring up to Fr. Xavier Soreng, who
is the Secretary of this organization (_Bagaicha_). I informed him.
Mr. Diwarkar, having seen me making a phone call, began yelling and
shouting arrogantly at me saying, that he could arrest me for phoning
up to people to inform them of their arrival. I told him, 'Sorry, we
belong to a religious organization and we do have our superiors to
be informed'. Then Mr. Diwarkar spoke to Stan. He firstly informed
Stan that they are coming from the National Investigation Agency. He
asked Stan to bring his identity card. Stan again walked to his room
and brought his voter identity card. Mr. Chandan took a photo of
the voter identity card. Then, Mr. Diwarkar informed Stan that he
would visit him soon to ask some questions about a case for fifteen
minutes. Then Mr. Diwarkar went out to make a call over his phone
to someone for some time. He came back and informed Stan that
he would come on another day and talk to him only, perhaps for
fifteen minutes. Then both of them left _Bagaicha_. While leaving
Mr. Diwarkar apologized for being a bit arrogant with me. I told him,
"You did your duty."

## 27 July, Monday for 2 hours --- Day 1 of actual interrogation

**Interrogator:** I would like to have your biodata, from beginning up
to now.


\

**Stan:** I gave a brief narrative, starting from the place of my birth,
early education, college studies and my entrance into the Society of
Jesus, in 1957.


\

**Int:** Please tell me what all studies and in which universities you have
done?


\

**Stan:** I had done my post graduate studies in sociology at the Ateneo
De Manila University in the Philippines. Then, I had also done some
special studies in social analysis in Louvain University, Belgium.


\

**Int:** When did you start your social involvement?


\

**Stan:** My social involvement started from 1975, when I worked at
the Indian Social Institute, Bangalore, which is a social centre for
social activists who were involved in their respective communities.
Most of those who came for the training were from the deprived
sections of society, namely, _Dalits_ and _Adivasis_. In 1990 or 1991,
I reached Jharkhand and I was asked to revive a social organisation,
by name JOHAR, which was founded in 1989, but had then become
inactive during the course of time. By 1995, JOHAR became active
again and I worked for five years with some committed _Adivasi_ youth,
taking up different issues of the _Adivasi_ people who have been facing
issues such as, displacement by mining companies and a host of other
exploitative forces. Jharkhand became a separate state in the year
2000 and some of the leaders and the intellectuals felt the need that
we should have a centre at the state capital Ranchi. Thus, originated
the idea of _Bagaicha_ and I have been here up to now.


\

**Int:** Which all countries you have been to and for what purpose?


\

**Stan:** I have been to Belgium to participate in a conference. I have
been to Philippines to attend some conventions. All these meetings
were focused on, to understand what was happening in the so-called
'third world', economically and politically.

Int[^/19] : What do you know about _Naxal_ movement?

[^/19]: During the interrogation, the interrogator will go out and make
a phone call and then will continue. It was clear to me that he
was briefing and getting instructions. This happened many a
times during all days of interrogation.


\

**Stan:** I am a trained sociologist. Hence, I have been keenly observing
the _Naxal_[^/20] movement. I know about its origin, growth and the present
situation as a social scientist. However, I differ from the _Naxalite_
ideology and do not agree with its methodology and therefore, I have
nothing to do with it.

[^/20]: _Naxalbari_ is the name of village in West Bengal State. The
Santhal _Adivasi_ (indigenous) people there were exploited and
illegally dispossessed of their land by moneylenders and other
exploitative forces. Countering these forces of exploitation, an
armed insurgency emerged there in the 1960s. The insurgents
later adopted the ideology of _Maoism_. Since its place of origin
in India was _Naxalbari_, the movement took its name "_Naxal_" or
"_Naxalite_ movement" in India.


\

**Int:** What about Operation Green Hunt[^/21]?

[^/21]: Operation Green hunt is the name given by media to the special
operation against _Naxalites_ in the central Indian states of
Chattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh in 2009.
About 1500 people have lost their lives; hundreds of youth have
been arrested and Special Forces like COBRA, Grey Hounds,
army, and other forces numbering 300,000 were involved with air
force and attack helicopters to wipe out _Naxalism_. _Adivasis_ and
_Adivasi_ villages have been the worst affected by this Operation.
For more info, see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Green_Hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Green_Hunt).


\

**Stan:** It was a policy of an erstwhile government, which in the
name of containing _Naxalism_, indiscriminately threw into jails, large
numbers of innocent young men and women. Majority of those
killed/imprisoned were _Adivasis_. There were large-scale protests
against it, all over the country.


\

**Int:** What about Jammu-Kashmir?


\

**Stan:** I know it as a vexing issue but did not/do not have any relation
to it. I have nothing to do with Jammu-Kashmir issue.


\

**Int:** What relationship do you have with those who are accused on
the Bhima-Koregaon case?


\

**Stan:** I know some of them personally and others I know through the
media and their writings.


\

**Int:** Do you know Sudha Bhardwaj?[^/22]

[^/22]: Sudha Bharadwaj is a committed human rights lawyer who worked
for the rights of _Dalit_ and _Adivasi_ labourers in Chhattisgarh
state. She has also been arrested in relation to Bhima-Koregaon
riot case and she has been in jail for nearly a couple of years.


\

**Stan:** Yes, I know her in the context of the research on under-trials
and later when I was pursuing legal action to help the under-trials and
formation of Persecuted Prisoners' Solidarity Forum (PPSC), that I
undertook.


\

**Int:** What about Saibaba?[^/23]

[^/23]: Mr. Saibaba is a professor of English at Delhi University. He has
been a 90% disabled person who moves around on a wheelchair.
However, he was also arrested in relation to some sedition case
and has been in jail for about three years.


\

**Stan:** I have seen and heard Prof. Saibaba only at a meeting in Ranchi
organized on the issue of displacement many years ago. As I have
been engaged with the issue of displacement, I went for the meeting
and participated like any other interested person on displacement
issue. The meeting took place long ago and I am not able to recall the
date of the meeting now.


\

**Int:** Do you know Nandini Sundar?


\

**Stan:** Yes, I know her, and I know her personally. She is a scholar
and professor at Delhi University. What attracted me to her was
her strenuous and persevering efforts to get justice for _Adivasis_
of Bastar district in Chhattisgarh. In my view, Salwajudum[^/24] had
wreaked havoc to the Gonds and other _Adivasis_, wherein not only
the _Adivasi_ communities were divided but put them one against the
other. About 600 _adivasi_ villages were burned down and people had
to flee for their life. Nandini Sundar studied the whole situation and
filed a case against the then Chhattisgarh government in the Supreme
Court. Finally, the Supreme Court issued an order disbanding
Salwajudum and ordering the state government to rehabilitate
_Adivasis_. Sometime later, Prof. Nandini Sundar had come to Ranchi
and I had an opportunity to meet her.

[^/24]: Salwajudum was a state-backed people's resistance movement in
2005 to counter the _Maoist_/_Naxalite_ movement in predominantly
_Adivasi_ regions of Chhattisgarh state.


\

**Int:** Who is Partho?


\

**Stan:** Partho is a scientist in Kolkata. He is doing research on medicine
for cancer. He is also a committed member of PPSC. When he heard
about my appeal to help out the under-trial prisoners, he also turned
up for the meeting.

## 28 July --- Tuesday --- Five Hours

**Int:** Tell me about Persecuted Prisoners' Solidarity Forum (PPSC)?


\

**Stan:** During 2014--15, indiscriminate arrests, of mostly _Adivasi_ and
_Dalit_ youth, were taking place. We realized this was the case in all the
tribal dominant states of central India. I called on whoever I knew
being involved for people's rights to come, so that we could reflect
on the nature of the intervention we needed to initiate. The response
was good, especially from lawyers. We decided to form a common
forum by name, 'Persecuted Prisoners Solidarity Committee' (PPSC),
so that we could intervene judicially, on behalf of Under-Trial
Prisoners (UTPs), seeking immediate bail and speed up trial. The
group asked me to be the convener of this forum. Soon thereafter,
based on the findings of our study of UTPs in Jharkhand, a PIL was
filed in Jharkhand HC, me being the main petitioner. Even as the HC
admitted my petition, it ordered the State government to furnish all
the information about all the UTPs in Jharkhand. It is now more than
two years, but the state is yet to submit the needed info adequately.
On the other hand, Jharkhand state decided to put me out of its
way, by implicating me in a case, merely based on my comments on
Facebook related to _Pathalgadi_ movement. While on the other hand,
the Pune police have implicated me in relation to Bhima-Koregaon
riot case, to which I have no connection at all.


\

**Int:** Tell me about the Bhima-Koregaon case?


\

**Stan:** I have never been in Bhima-Koregaon in all my life. I also
know that the Pune police have been in contact with Khunti police
and an affidavit about me made by the Pune police was presented in
the annexure of the case in relation to _Pathalgadi_ movement at the
Jharkhand High Court. Actually, it is just a case to silence me.


\

**Int:** Tell me about _Pathalgadi_?


\

**Stan:** _Pathalgadi_ is a part of the cultural tradition of _Adivasis_ in central
India. The Mundari speaking _Adivasi_ group in Khunti district of
Jharkhand was using the stone slab, being erected as _Pathalgadi_, to
inscribe their constitutional rights mentioned in the 5^th^ Schedule and
PESA Act, 1996 of the Indian Constitution, to assert their rights to
self-governance. However, the state government took this _Pathalgadi_
movement as a case of sedition against the State and deployed the
paramilitary forces in those areas to suppress the movement. Some
activists, (20 of us) including me, had posted what we thought about
the state's reaction to _Pathalgadi_. In fact, I had made two comments
on my Facebook page: (1) the erstwhile Home Minister of Central
Government, when he was asked about the _Pathalgadi_ issue by some
media personnel, said, "Wherever the movement has been happening,
the state governments should enter into a dialogue with the people".
I had added a comment to his statement, saying, "It was sad that the
Jharkhand government, instead of dialoguing with the people, was
attacking them"; and (2) A local three-term Member of Parliament
(MP), Sri. Kharia Munda, was asked about the _Pathalgadi_ issue. He
responded saying, "If development had taken place well among
_Adivasis_, the _Pathalgadi_ movement would not have arisen". I had
added a comment to this as well, saying, "The local MP himself had
testified that real development of _Adivasi_ society had not taken place.
So, it will be better for the Jharkhand Government to focus its efforts
on the real development of _Adivasis_."

Based on these two comments of mine on my Facebook-page, the
State government filed an FIR against me, in July 2018. The names
of 19 other activists are also mentioned in the FIR, for their posts
on their Facebook relating to _Pathalgadi_. Interestingly, among the
20 of us, whose names are mentioned in the FIR, an arrest warrant
was issued only on four of us, on 19 June 2019. However, towards the
end of June 2019, I had gone to South India as I had planned long
ago, to meet my kith and kin and friends and to attend to some health
problems, I have been suffering with. In the meantime, the Khunti
police, even without taking the trouble to verify my whereabouts,
declared me as an 'absconder'. Finally, on 21 October 2019, my living
room was raided and whatever they found in my room (2 tables, three
chairs, a shelf where I kept my belongings, and my mattress
and a pillow) were taken way. Against these illegal actions ---
issuing of an arrest warrant, declaring me as an absconder
and attachment of my property --- I had filed a case in the
Jharkhand High Court (Cr. M. P No 3183 of 2018), praying
that it restores my self-respect and dignity. On 6 December 2019,
the Jharkhand High Court in its Order stated that proper procedures
were not followed as per Code of Criminal Procedure. The Court also
mentioned in its Order, however, that the lower Court could proceed
with the matter adhering to the Code of Criminal Procedure.[^/25]
This is where I stand with regard to this case. Interestingly, the
new government of Jharkhand on 29 December 2020, soon after
the swearing in ceremony, held a Cabinet meeting and decided to
withdraw all the cases relating to _Pathalgadi_ in Jharkhand. Although,
the decision has been made, the judicial processes to this end has not
yet been completed.

[^/25]: Ref: Stan Swamy vs The State Of Jharkhand on 6 December, 2019. Paragraph 26. In view of what has been held above, the
order dated 19.06.2019 passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate,
Khunti in Khunti Police Station Case No.124 of 2018 (G.R.
No.287 of 2018) by which warrant of arrest has been issued
and the order dated 22.07.2019 passed by the Chief Judicial
Magistrate, Khunti in Khunti Police Station Case No.124 of
2018 (G.R. No.287 of 2018) by which process under Section 82
of the Code of Criminal Procedure has been issued, are hereby
set aside and quashed. Since, these two orders are set aside, the
order dated 24.09.2019 passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate,
Khunti in Khunti Police Station Case No.124 of 2018 (G.R.
No.287 of 2018), by which the process under Section 83 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, which is a consequential order
to the issuance of process under Section 82 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, is also hereby set aside, as because process
under Section 83 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, on facts
of this case, is not an independent provision and is dependent
on the validity of the order, by which process under Section 82
of the Code of Criminal Procedure is issued.

    Paragraph 27. In the light of the above, this criminal miscellaneous
    petition is allowed. The matter is remanded to the Court below
    for proceeding in accordance with law afresh after complying
    with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure.


\

**Int:** These are some extracts taken from your computer (he shows the
monitor of his laptop) which seem to relate you with leftist forces?


\

**Stan:** Please show them to me. (_He pulled out the extracts of some
communications from his laptop and placed them before me. An extract supposedly
taken from a folder titled, "Earth Summit",[^/26] in my computer wherein an appeal
from some Naxal was made to celebrate the 50^th^ anniversary of the origin of the
Naxalbari movement. They were inviting Stan to participate in the celebration_).
I flatly disowned these extracts and affirmed that they have been
interpolated into my computer.

[^/26]: Earth Summit was a three-day event from 27--29 March 2015,
organized by the Jesuits, in Kolkata on Global Climate Change
and Water Disaster, in which about 50 Jesuits participated. The
main speaker was Dr Rajendra Singh, the Waterman of India.


\

**Int:** Nothing of that sort can take place with the NIA, because NIA
is an organisation of integrity, and strictly follows the prescribed
cloning process. (He was a bit excited when he said this).


\

**Stan:** I am not questioning the integrity or the lack of it with the NIA.
But the fact is that the NIA took over the Bhima-Koregaon case only
in January 2020 from the Pune police which had been handling the
case from August 2018. Would you also vouch for the same integrity
for the Pune police as you are vouching for the NIA?


\

**Int:** (He was silent for some time and then reiterated) "We as a police
force is an integral body. Our work is to protect people and we keep
our integrity." (Then, he stood up to leave the place for the day.)


\

**Stan:** I agree with you that Police are expected to act with integrity.
What about the recent incident in Tamil Nadu wherein a father and
his son, because they kept their shop open for a few extra minutes
after the lockdown time, were arrested, beaten up, tortured and killed?
The Madras High Court has taken _Suo Motu_ cognition of the case and
has ordered a CBI enquiry into it?


\

**Int:** Locally something can go wrong, but the police force as such is
an integral body. (Then he left the place.)

## 29 July 2020 Wednesday --- 3 hours.


**Int:** Tell me about _Bagaicha_ and its activities?


\

**Stan:** _Bagaicha_, in _Adivasi_ tradition, is the place the community gathers,
discusses whatever needs to be discussed and comes to a consensus
decision. This is the name we have given to the centre, so those who
come here will go back to their communities 'with one mind'. Mostly
_Adivasi_ and _Dalit_ activists come here to:

(i) Scientifically analyse and
understand the problems/issues they are faced with,
(ii) Search for
effective ways of educating, mobilising the people,
(iii) Take it before
the relevant government office/department, asking for immediate
attention and
(iv) If government administration fails them, then to
plan and act how to seek judicial remedy.

_Bagaicha_ has been trying to
accompany the people in solidarity.

About the activities of _Bagaicha_, we recently have started a Migrants'
Desk, and its intervention during and after the recent lockdown, due
to the coronavirus pandemic was significant. It was necessitated by
the sudden declaration of lockdown, throwing millions of migrant
workers out-of-work, shelter, food and forcing thousands of them
walk on highways and railway tracks for hundreds of kilometres. Our
Migrants' Desk (MD) is linked with governments, NGOs and human
rights groups, to reach out to the migrants to offer immediate relief
in the form of food and shelter and help them to reach their homes.
We have helped at least about 6,000 persons, who were in precarious
situations. Lakhs of them have reached home, but is there anything in
their homes to sustain them and their families?


\

**Int:** Oh, Migrants Desk is doing a good work. What other activities
do you have at _Bagaicha_?


\

**Stan:** Another activity being carried out through _Bagaicha_ is called
Lok-Manch (LM). The government has many schemes, projects
and programmes for the disadvantaged persons and groups, but the
poorest of the poor who live in interior villages are not even aware,
much less avail of those schemes. LM workers help them to know
and avail of these opportunities. As I am not a member of LM, one
of our staff who is in it, will explain it to you in detail. (Ms. Rosemary
Nag, Lok-Manch campaign facilitator, was called to explain the type
of the work done by the Lok-Manch partners. She explained about
her role of coordinating the activities, in different units, regarding the
implementation of MGNREGA[^/27], enabling villagers to access various
pensions and other social security schemes of the government. She
added that her duty is to collect the reports from partner organisations
and provide them to the central coordinating team.)

[^/27]: Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Act
(MGNREGA) is an Act promulgated in 2005 by the central
government which offers opportunities to unemployed people
to work and earn for at least for 100 days a year.


\

**Int:** There are again a whole series of communications; reports by
ultra-left parties that where found discovered your computer? What
do you have to say about them?


\

**Stan:** I have no knowledge of any of these communications and I
have nothing to do with them. They are interpolations. (Once again,
the interrogator began taking up copies letters saying that these letters
were from my computer. These letters were relating somehow to the
so-called "ultra-leftists". I always stood my ground; I pointed out that
only in the context of the formation of PPSC I came to know people
like Prashant Rahi (a social activist and writer), Adv. Sudha Bharadwaj
and Adv. Shiv Prasad Singh (an advocate practicing in Jharkhand
High Court, a member of PPSC) who helped us to form and activate
PPSC. With this, the day's interrogation was concluded).

## 30 July 2020, Thursday - 2 hours.

**Int:** What are the facilities at _Bagaicha_ and who are the other members
and their activities at _Bagaicha_?


\

**Stan:** The place where we are sitting is the administrative block. It
houses the main office, library documentation and a few living rooms
for the Jesuit staff. The building towards the north is the dormitory,
where the participants who come for various programmes, stay for
the night. In the south, is the building with ground floor as a dining
hall and on top of it, is a meeting hall. As regarding the personnel,
Fr. David Solomon SJ is the Director, Fr. Sebastian Lakra SJ is the
administrator and I, Stan Swamy, am a staff member. Ms. Sugia Horo
is the programme coordinator and office assistant. Then, there are
three other staff members, who help out with the maintenance such
as, preparation of food, cleaning and gardening.


\

**Int:** There are more letters I need to discuss with you. These letters
are from your computer. (He mentioned a few letters relating to
some funds and some meetings and persons. He mentioned about
one Mr. Abhay. Another _dada_ writing to _Stan dada_ ... )


\

**Stan:** I do not know any _dada_. I do not use the language of _dada_.
I do not know who Mr. Abhay is, who you say has written this letter.
Moreover, if a letter does not contain the name of the 'sender' and
name of the person 'to whom it is sent', then I think it is not worth
considering. It must be discarded as junk. Therefore, it serves no
purpose that you keep on producing these types of letters. I only know
one Mr. Abhay Xaxa, a scholar from Jawaharlal Nehru University
(JNU), hailing from Chhattisgarh, who was very much involved with
issues affecting the _Adivasis_. Very sadly, he died a pre-mature death a
few months ago.


\

**Int:** Okay, since you are denying the authenticity of these letters
and your lack of knowledge about these persons I have mentioned,
please make a statement. And please note, I am only noting down
the responses you give me to my queries. I will submit them to my
superior officers who would make the conclusions about them.


\

**Stan:** That's fine. This is my statement, "_All my contacts with social activists
has been within Jharkhand state, and the only occasion to contact people out of
Jharkhand was in the context of setting up PPSC covering the 4 central states
(Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal and Chhattishgarh) in view of coordinating
efforts on behalf of under-trial prisoners in all these states with the possibility
of going to the Supreme Court of India. Apart from that, I do not have any
relation/contact with anyone. I have absolutely no relation or contact with any
ultra-forces/persons_".

(Then, almost at the point of getting up to leave, he looked at a
stone-slab (_Pathalgadi_) at the courtyard of _Bagaicha_[^/28], wherein the
martyrs of Jharkhand who laid down their lives for protecting their
land water and forest have been written to commemorate them and
their contribution to the society). The Interrogator then made a
comment: "You have mentioned the names of people who died by
police firing, but why you have not mentioned people's names who
were killed by _Maoists_?

[^/28]: _Bagaicha_ has a stone-slab erected in the middle of its courtyard.
The names of the _Adivasi_ freedom fighters, activists and others
committed to _Adivasi_ causes are written on it. These names
are of people have laid down their lives standing up against
injustice and exploitation and asserting their rights starting from 1770. This _Pathalgadi_ with the names of martyrs enables us to
commemorate their lives and contribution to _Adivasi_ societies.
Usually, many groups coming here, stand in front this particular
stone-slab and pay their respects to these Jharkhandi martyrs.


\

**Stan:** It is possible that some _Maoists_ could have been involved in
some of these incidents, but their identities have not officially been
established and our efforts are to give voice to the voiceless.

## 6 August 2020 (one and a half hour) --- he arrived at 11.15 a.m.

**Int:** I have come to inquire about one case and will go back.


\

**Stan:** Please go ahead.


\

**Int:** In your computer, a folder titled "Earth Summit" containing a
file describes a communication between two Lok-Manch workers.
There are two points on which I want some clarification from you:

(1) The letter says, "Since the Indian state is becoming more and more
fascist, we need to join forces with banned groups to counter the state
fascism;
(2) in order to do this we will need funds, at least some $ 6--10
million; and
(3) all these works would be done out under the direction
of father Stan".


\

**Stan:** It is rubbish. I disown this letter and communication. It is a
fabrication, stealthily inserted into my computer. We are a religious
body. You have seen this place, our set up and how we live. Do you
need more explanation?

(The interrogator began explaining elaborately the ways of cloning of
documents is done. He asked his assistant holding a camera to explain
the process they go through in cloning. The person did explain. I
listened to the whole thing and finally reminded again what I had
already said once before as they vouched the integrity of what the
NIA does.)


\

**Int:** I have been asked to find if the fund that comes for Lok-Manch
project activities has been going to the ultra-left activists. What do
you have to say about it?


\

**Stan:** Neither I nor _Bagaicha_ has anything to do with ultra-left activist.
_Bagaicha_ is a place for poor _adivasis_ and _Dalits_ and not for anyone
whom you term as 'ultra-left'. About LM, I only know some of the
activities they undertake. I am not associated with LM project. It is
a centrally coordinated project. There is a staff member who will be
able to give you some details about LM activities.


\

**Int:** Who is that person?


\

**Stan:** He is Solomon. He is not here now. He has gone to Hazaribagh
(a place about 100 kilometres away from Ranchi). He said he is on the
way back. You may talk to him when he comes back.


\

**Int:** Can I see your passport?

(Stan gave him his passport. The interrogator glanced through it. He
made his assistant to take a photo of the passport. Having seen the
passport, I was asked why I had not told him earlier about my visit
to China.


\

**Stan:** I replied, "I have mentioned to you about the countries I visited
and have spent some time on specific works and not those through
which I have just passed. My visit to China was just like a tourist's
visit. Hence, I did not mention it to you."

The investigator insisted to keep the Interrogation process secret. The
officer was too sensitive about strangers coming in. He began asking
who they were whenever someone passed by. For example, he asked,
"Who was she?" pointing to students walking to the study room.
The officer was vehemently insisting to keep the entire process of
interrogation confidential. Stan responded saying that this is a public
act and should come into notice of the public just as it has taken
place with the two other persons who have been interrogated by the
NIA recently. However, the investigator said, "I don't know what has
happened elsewhere, but here I do not want this matter to go out".

The NIA interrogator told me that he would make a report of
the interrogation, but some superior officer would draw the final
conclusion. What that conclusion will be and what action will ensue
are all very nebulous.
