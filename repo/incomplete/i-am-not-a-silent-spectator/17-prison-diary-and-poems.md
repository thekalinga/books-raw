# Prison Diary

**Dear Joe and Solo,**

\ 

I hope you are all keeping fine.

I want to share with you that I am keeping good health, despite some
ailments. A few fellow prisoners are very helpful to me. Considering
my age and inability to adopt to prison conditions, I am given an
assistant to help me to move around. I have been given a private
cell with commode facility and simple special diet. I have access to
some journals and magazines. I spend my time in reading, praying and
interacting with fellow prisoners. I have asked for some warm clothes
as it is cold here. I hope the prison authorities will permit me to have
them to protect me.

I am languishing in prison for some alleged offences, which I have
not committed. If this is God's will, so be it. I hope truth will win and
I will be released soon on bail. I received your greetings and prayers
through one of my Jesuit colleagues, whom I called over phone on
25 October, Sunday morning. I am allowed to make phone call once
in 15 days. Continue to remember me and all my friends here in the
prison.

\ 

As for my family members and other kith & kin, the one person who
I could suggest is my nephew Kumar Alex in Chennai who could be
communicated regarding whatever happens to me. He will forward,
what needs to be informed to my other kith & kin, using his own
discretion. The way of the cross is long, and we have to walk it till the
end with the mutual concern & solidarity we share together.

**Dear friends,**

\ 

Peace! Though I do not have many details, from what I have heard,
I am grateful to all of you for expressing your solidarity support.
I am in a cell approximately 13 feet x 8 feet, along with two more
inmates. It has a small bathroom and a toilet with Indian commode.
Fortunately, I am given a western commode chair. Varavara Rao,
Vernon Gonsalves and Arun Ferreira are in another cell. During the
day, when cells and barracks are opened, we meet with each other.
From 5.30 pm to 06.00 am and 12 noon to 03.00 pm, I am locked up
in my cell, with two inmates. Arun assists me to have my breakfast and
lunch. Vernon helps me with bath. My two inmates help out during
supper, in washing my clothes and give massage to my knee joints.
They are from very poor families. Please remember my inmates and
my colleagues in your prayers. Despite all odds, _humanity is bubbling in
Taloja prison_.

\ 

In solidarity, Stan

## Lie upon lie

30 Sept 2020: Colleague Solo gets a phone call from SP-NIAMumbai
asking him to bring Stan to Mumbai on Monday for further
interrogation. Solo tells him it will not be possible given my age,
health conditions. SP asks Solo to hand over my medical papers to
NIA man in Ranchi.

\

6--8 Oct: We prepare my medical papers and try to contact NIA man
who never came (_Lie no. 1_)

\

8 Oct 8 pm: NIA team cum police landed up at _Bagaicha_ and ask me
to go with them to their office to meet their officer just to clarify 4 to
5 points (_Lie no.2_) ... they forcibly take me and on reaching their office
they tell me I'm arrested! ... Some forms were filled up and my lawyer
signs it ... I ask for their officer who was supposed to question me ...
they tell me he would come the following day at 11 am (_Lie no. 3_) ...
I refuse to eat and lay down on a mat and try to sleep.

\

9 Oct: They all had _nasta_ but I refused to eat ... around 7 am they tell
me 'let us go'.. I ask 'where'...'to Mumbai'... In the meantime, two of
my Jesuit colleagues bring a handbag with some clothes ... I ask NIA
men 'where is the officer who was supposed to question me'
(_Lie no. 4_) ... they tell me it will be in Mumbai.. they forcibly brought
me to Mumbai by flight. On the way from airport, I tell the NIA men
that I want to meet the SP ... they tell me I can meet him at the court ...
On arrival they pointed out the SP and I quietly went up to meet him
and he tells me the magistrate will hear me! (_Lie no. 5_)

**Dear friends,**

\ 

Thank you so much for the solidarity support by so many, for me and
my co-accused. I am really grateful.

The Prison administration provides breakfast, tea, milk, lunch and
dinner. Any additional edibles are to be purchased from the prison
canteen, twice a month. Also, newspapers, toiletries, stationary
and other essentials can be purchased through the prison canteen.
My needs are limited. The _Adivasis_ and the Society of Jesus have
taught me to lead a simple life.

I had brought with me a "sipper-tumbler", to drink tea and water.
However, the same was disallowed at the prison gate, on entry on
9 October. Now, I am using a baby-sipper mug, which I purchased
through the prison hospital. I have communicated this need to our
lawyers. I am still waiting to receive the sipper-tumbler.

Varavara Rao is very sick. Kindly, pray for him. Listening to the
life-narratives of the poor prisoners is my joy in Taloja. I see God in
their pains and smiles.

\ 

Regards, Stan

**Dear Joe,**

\ 

I have received couple of letters from you. Thank you for your
expressions of solidarity. As you are aware, cold climate is affecting
me. I had asked for full sleeve sweater, thin blanket and two pair of
socks. I am sorry to hear that these materials were not accepted at the
prison gate, and the one who brought them had to take them back,
not once but three times. I am sorry for causing this trouble. I have
personally spoken to the prison and hospital authorities and they have
permitted me to receive them. Next time, when someone reaches
these materials, I pray the guards will receive them and give me.

I have not met Arun Ferreira and Vernon Gonsalves before. I only
read their names in the papers, when they were arrested. They are my
new companions in my quest for justice for the poor. I request you
to pray for them and their families. I consider imprisonment as an
opportunity to share fag end of my life with many innocent prisoners.
Let 'Faith that does Justice' become a reality in Jesuit way of life.

**Dear Joe and Mihir,**

\ 

I have gone through the reply filed by the NIA. There are some
paragraphs that I could not understand as I do not have a copy of
the Bail Application filed by my lawyers. Nor do I have a copy of the
Rejoinder that has been filed thereafter. So, I am just going by the
points raised in the reply of the NIA.

There are two organizations viz. VVJA and PPSC that I have been
associated with for which the State is posting false allegations.

At para no. 24 of the NIA reply, there is a mention of VVJA being a
frontal organization. VVJA is an open-ended organization comprising
of _Adivasi_ and _Dalit_ farmers who have either lost their land and
therefore been displaced or have been served notice about their land
being acquired and therefore are potentially displaced. When any such
case is brought before the VVJA, its members gather and collect all
the facts related to the case particularly with regard to specific laws
and constitutional provisions to protect the rights of _Adivasis_. It
mainly focusses on whether the 5^th^ Schedule of constitution and Legal
provisions of PESA Act, 1996 and FRA Act, 2006 have been followed
in the process of land acquisitions. By and large, these provisions are
not abided by the land acquiring authority. It is then, that VVJA takes
up this matter and exposes the failures of implementation before the
government officials. The VVJA gives great importance to whether the
respective _Gram Sabhas_ had given their consent or no. In some cases,
the Government officials have attended to the points raised and in
other cases they have been ignored. VVJA also brings such instances
to the attention of the general public through the media, with hope
that this will help pressurize the administration to act.

In the same para no. 24, it is alleged that I attended a meeting of
VVJA in Kolkata. It is not true. I had gone to Kolkata to attend a
meeting organized by a Co-ordination Committee of Human Rights
Organizations.

In the same para no. 24, reference is made to PUCL also being a
frontal organization of CPI (_Maoist_). This was never mentioned
anywhere in the Charge sheet.

At the para no. 26, there is an allegation that PPSC is also a frontal
organization of CPI (_Maoist_). During 2014--15, there was an
indiscriminate arrest of young men and women whoever resisted
displacement and were imprisoned under the charge of being _Maoist_.
This was true not only in Jharkhand but also in States having a
significant tribal population such as MP, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand,
Odisha and West Bengal. Towards the end of 2015, about 70 lawyers
and activists from all these states got together at Ranchi to decide
how to intervene legally into such a situation. They called this
collective PPSC. The very first task that they decided to undertake
was a study of such undertrials in the above-mentioned States. One
such study had already been conducted by '_Bagaicha_'. Thereafter,
legal action would be initiated based on these studies. As such, PPSC
is a spontaneous endeavor by concerned citizens and not initiated by
CPI (_Maoist_).

At para no. 30, there is a mention that a case has been filed against me.
This is a case registered during the _Pathalgadi_ movement. The present
JMM-Congress State Government of Jharkhand, on assuming office
decided during a cabinet meeting to withdraw all _Pathalgadi_ cases.
Although the decision has been taken by the government, its actual
implementation is in process. Please find out the latest news regarding
this and inform the Mumbai lawyers.

At para no. 32, there is mention of an accusation against me to have
led a protest opposing Operation Green hunt. It is true that such a
protest was held and the same was conducted with the permission of
the Police. Hence it was not illegal.

At para no. 34, there is a mention of _Bagaicha_. I would like to
reiterate that _Bagaicha_ is an organization founded by the Catholic
Church as part of its goals and objectives.

In conclusion, there are some points mentioned in the Reply that I
strongly refute & deny, such as

* That VVJA and PPSC are frontal organizations of CPI (_Maoist_)
* That the letters and documents found in my computer were
  placed there by me or seen by me. In fact, they have been planted
  in my computer
* That I received Rs. 8 lakhs from some Comrade Mohan of the
  CPI (_Maoist_)

Hope these above clarifications by me are of help.

**Dear friends,**

\ 

Thank you for your deep concern for my wellbeing. The Jail authorities
have been very considerate. Recently, I was given a sipper, which I am
using for drinking water and tea.

When I was taken by NIA on 8 October, I was told that I had to
meet with an officer in NIA camp office in Ranchi, to answer 5 or 6
questions. Believing the words of the officers, without taking anything
with me, I went with them. After reaching the NIA camp office, I was
told that I am arrested. I was not surprised. The officers did their duty
as they were told to do. Later around 11 pm, at the instructions of the
NIA officers, my Jesuit companions brought a bag and handed over
to me. This bag contained clothes, ever-silver sipper, medicines and
my wallet with some cash and my original voter ID Card. I carried this
bag with me to Mumbai. When I was taken to the Taloja prison, the
bag was not given to me. The bag may be either with NIA or the Jail
authorities, safe.

Friends, we are in the season of Advent. As we approach Christmas,
let us pray that Jesus may be born in Taloja prison, this year.

**MY REFELCTION**

\ 

First of all, I deeply appreciate the overwhelming solidarity expressed
by many during these past 100 days behind the bars. At times, news of
such solidarity has given me immense strength and courage especially
when the only thing certain in prison is uncertainty. Life here is on
a day-to-day basis. Another strength during these past hundred days,
has been in observing the plight of the undertrials. A majority of
them come from economically & socially weaker communities. Many
of such poor undertrials don't know what charges have been put
on them, have not seen their charge sheet and just remain in prison
for years without any legal or other assistance. Overall, almost all
undertrials are compelled to live to a bare minimum, whether rich
or poor. This brings in a sense of brotherhood & communitarianism
where reaching out to each other is possible even in this adversity. On
the other hand, we sixteen co-accused have not been able to meet each
other, as we are lodged in different jails or different 'circles' within the
same jail. But we will still sing in chorus. _A caged bird can still sing._

\ 

In solidarity, Stan

**Dear one and all,**

\ 

All of you have expressed hope that I will be released soon. Much
as it may be desirable in itself, I'm beginning to question if it is
proper. I've met all my co-accused lodged in this prison. They are all
such precious human beings who have given the most and best of
themselves for the cause of the deprived. They have been in jail for
more than two years but have not been able to get bail. I'm the last
(16^th^ ) to be arrested in the same case. I think that my release in the
near future will be justifiable only if it somehow provides an opening
for others to get bail.

\ 

In solidarity, Stan

\ 

Stan's bail plea yet again differed to March 11

\ 

\ 

**Dear one and all,**

\ 

Pardon me for clubbing all of you together as I have one and the same
message to give to you all. Practically everyone writing to me express
the wish that I be released from prison 'at the earliest/immediately/
without any further delay' or any such wish.

Apart from the fact the wheels of justice turn very slow, all 16 of us
implicated in the serious cases such as sedition and UAPA where it is
very difficult to get bail. Still our lawyers are trying their very best. So,
we await 'the ides of March' on the 11^th^ of March.

Whereas arrests under sedition are increasing conviction is just
3%. As for UAPA, 5922 arrests were made during 2016--2019,
only 132 were convicted. (Source: Times of India 17-02-2021). Our
prisons are bursting at the seams. Consequently, we have a scenario of
deprivation of even the basic amenities to prisoners.

\ 

So much for now

\ 

Ever in solidarity, Stan

**Dear Joe, Solo,**

\ 

Thank you so much for your very reassuring letters.
Joe, I'm in receipt of the money, medicines, book. Thank you. Many
are keen to read the book.

Solo, I'm awaiting to hear about our proposal of sponsoring some
_Adivasi_ school-going children with the award money. Sorry I made
this suggestion during the time you were harassed so much by NIA.
Very much hope that trying period is over. And thanks for rising up
to the occasion.

Thanking Fr. Stany, POSA for his thoughtful Press Release appreciating
the role of our very committed lawyers. We did not succeed this time
at the lower court but very hopeful of doing so in the high court.

Gently reminding Joe about the charge sheet of our helper Mohd
Shabir. Poor man has been in jail for over five years without knowing
why he is in jail.

Kindly convey my love and greetings to all our Jesuit bretheren, staff
members, co-workers, friends at _Bagaicha_ and ISI-Bangalore.

\ 

Ever in solidarity, Stan

**Dear Joe, Solo,**

\ 

Now that you have left it to me about what to do with the Award
money (Mukundan C Menon Human Rights Award was conferred
on Stan, containing a citation and Rs. 25,000), please find a few
children whose fathers are in jail because they stood up for _Adivasi_
rights. Organize a simple function and give it to them. Hope it will
be possible.

\ 

Ever in solidarity, Stan
