# Prologue

'_Why truth has become so bitter, dissent so intolerable, justice so out of
reach?_' because truth has become very bitter to those in power and
position, dissent, so unpalatable to the ruling elite, justice, so out
of reach to the powerless, marginalised, deprived people. Yet, truth
must be spoken, right to dissent must be upheld, and justice must
reach the doorsteps of the poor. I am not a silent spectator.

This booklet is _not_ my autobiography. It is rather a collation of
some glimpses/episodes from my life that somehow made a
difference for me, and possibly for my confr√®res, colleagues and
the people with whom I have shared my life. Some episodes were
turning points in my life, some opened new vistas of involvement,
some raised question marks on what I was doing, some brought in
new colleagues/comrades into my life, some genuine expressions
of solidarity from all and sundry with the efforts, tribulations,
harassments I have gone through in the process of my humble
efforts in quest of truth and justice.

As I am reaching the fag end of my sojourn on mother earth, some
well-meaning friends have been asking me to put in writing my
reflections on the events, persons, the vision and mission I have
pursued and their fructification or otherwise. I warmly accepted
my friends' suggestion, but at the same time, was intrigued as to
when and where I would find the leisure, conducive atmosphere,
supportive friends and mental mood to sit quietly and do the
writing. Months and years came and went, and I was still looking
for the opportune time!

Now that opportune time came into my hands from the most
unexpected quarters! I and some of my colleagues were accused by
the Jharkhand police of instigating violence during the _Pathalgadi_
movement in Khunti district in mid-2018. Our lawyers told us that
the government had no real case against us, and it did not even
merit getting anticipatory bail. So, we thought the case was dead
and buried. But lo and behold, after a good year-and-a-half, when
the present national ruling party came back to power, a Jharkhand
court suddenly issued _warrants_ of _arrest_ on 19 June 2019 against me
and four other friends, of abetting violence in Khunti.

My friends advised me to take some time off from the scene, so
as to prepare a case in Jharkhand High Court and challenge the
state government. This also coincided with my custom of visiting
every four or five years, my family-folks, friends/comrades of
yester-years in the three southern states (Tamil Nadu, Kerala and
Karnataka). I also had some long-pending health related needs to
be attended to and this sojourn made that possible too.

Some friends kindly made available the needed facilities for writing,
and I wrote intermittently between my trips to different places.
Finally, I think I've completed the 'labour of love' my friends
entrusted to me. It may be taken for what it is worth.
