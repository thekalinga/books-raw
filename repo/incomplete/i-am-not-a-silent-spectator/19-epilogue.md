There is a strong belief among the Indigenous _Adivasi_ societies that
when someone dies he/she comes back in spirit to the near and dear
ones, to the persons he/she had shared life with, to the communities
he/she had struggled with, in resisting injustice. To celebrate this
'_coming back_', a few days after the person's demise, the entire village
community gathers in front of his/her house and the village priest
calls upon the departed spirit and invites him/her to come back and
dwell in their houses, to be a witness to all that happens to the dear
ones, and to guide and accompany them in their journey through life.
Then, the priest announces in which form the spirit has come back
to the house ... it can be as a plant, a tree, or an animal with which
he/she was close to or associated with during his/her life. The priest,
then, leads the spirit to the _adig_ (the place where food for the family is
prepared). From then on, when the family members sit down to have
their meal, the eldest male member of the family takes a few grains
of food from his plate and places it outside his plate and prays the
spirit to be with them as they nourish their bodies with food, so that
they can live a healthy life and work for the good of the family and
community.

This sentiment is echoed in other traditions as well. Martyrs are
referred to as '_amar_' (beyond death). Some religious texts interpret
death as 'life is changed, not ended'. The poet Kahlil Gibran's saying
"the river and the sea are one" means the fresh water of the river
when it flows into the sea becomes salty water, but _water remains water_.
The form may change but the substance is the same.

I have been inspired by such thoughts and attitudes. I often think of
those who have played a significant role in my life, whom mother
earth has now taken into her bosom, as being close to me at every
step, guiding, strengthening and standing by me in a never-fading
solidarity.

This is the way I wish to be remembered by near and dear colleagues
and comrades as well as those who I have tried my best to accompany
in their struggle for truth, justice and humanity.

But life is still there to live. May we all live our lives to the fullest!
