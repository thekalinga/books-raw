# _Pathalgadi_ equals Sedition

__Adivasi tradition made into a crime_

\

_Pathalgadi_ literally means erection of a stone-slab. In age-old _Adivasi_
tradition, when some significant and memorable event takes place, the
village community would undertake a _Pathalgadi_ at the entrance to the
village and inscribe the name or event on the stone-slab being erected.
This tradition is especially unique in _Mundari-speaking_ _Adivasi_ groups
which are considered to be the earliest settlers in the Chotanagpur area
of Jharkhand. Now off late, beginning from the mid-1990s, _Adivasis_
have been going through a process of disillusionment with regard
to both central and state governments and the capitalist ruling class
insofar, as no meaningful socio-economic development has taken
place in their ethno-territories. All so-called 'development projects'
have left them weaker than before in every aspect of life. Since their
land is mineral-rich, corporate houses and industrialists have been
bent upon plundering their natural resources. Mainly, these
processes have left them more impoverished and vulnerable.

Every mine that is dug, not only destroys the green forests, fertile lands
and water bodies but also often displaces entire village habitations.
No meaningful rehabilitation and resettlement of displaced people
has ever been undertaken. _Adivasi_ societies in central-eastern India
have continued to be a prey to the greed of upper classes and castes.

## Failure of the government to implement the PESA Act, 1996

_Panchayats Extension to Scheduled Areas_ (PESA) Act, 1996, which
was a fruit of _Adivasis_' long drawn struggle and their political
representatives; and which for the first time, recognized the fact that
the _Adivasi_ societies in India have had a rich social and cultural tradition
of self-governance, outlined the composition and functioning of
the _Gram Sabha_. Whereas, the reality is that, this Act of Parliament
has deliberately been left unimplemented in all the nine states with
significant _Adivasi_ populations. It means that the capitalist ruling class
does not want _Adivasi_ societies to self-govern themselves.

Understandably, the _Adivasis_ have come to the point of saying
'enough is enough.' They are ready to take up the challenge of
governing themselves. True, they have lost a lot of their land, forest
and natural resources; and have not had a share in the mineral wealth
which was dug out literally from beneath their feet by public and
private sector industries. Still, they have some of it left with them and
they have decided to keep it and use it for their own empowerment
and emancipation: welfare of their present and future generations.
Hence, from the mid-2000s, the Munda villages started undertaking
_Pathalgadi_s wherein they inscribed the powers of _Gram Sabha_ as per
the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution and the PESA Act. Most
of the _pathals_ include:

(1) supremacy of the power of traditional
_Gram Sabhas_,
(2) rights of _Adivasis_ over land and natural resources,
(3) non-_Adivasis_ and outsiders not allowed to independently move in
Scheduled Areas or to settle down and work in their ethno-territories
and
(4) _Adivasis_ are the original inhabitants of India. Several _pathals_
also proclaim voter IDs and Aadhaar cards as anti-_Adivasi_ documents.

The inscriptions read that any outsider must get the permission of
the _Gram Sabha_ before entering the village. What was initially a
trickle, became a torrent, especially from 2015 onwards, and spread
far beyond the Munda territory to other Tribes, not only in Jharkhand
but also in the neighbouring states of Chhattisgarh and Odisha.

The respective state governments became jittery and started sending
alarm signals saying, "_Adivasis_ are in the process of declaring
independence from the Indian Union and it amounts to 'secession'
incurring the crime of 'sedition', paving the way for penal action
against all those leading and/or participating in _Pathalgadi_-movement."

The paramilitary and police forces started to forcibly enter the villages,
especially where _Pathalgadi_ movements had reportedly occurred, in the
guise of catching _Maoists_. They even declared the whole movement as
_Maoist_ inspired. Some top leaders of the movement were imprisoned
and FIRs were filed indiscriminately implicating thousands of _Adivasi_
villagers. One FIR was filed against 11,200 unnamed villagers, a second
one, against 109 named persons which included several traditional
village-heads, and a third one, against 20 intellectuals, artists, writers,
social activists.

It was surprising to see that I too have been included among the
20 intellectuals against whom the third round of FIRs were filed. We
have been accused of having aroused the "poor, illiterate, ignorant"
_Adivasis_ to rise up against the state. True, I had made some minor
interventions on social media, urging the government to have
meaningful dialogues with the _Adivasis_ of the _Pathalgadi_-movement
and to find out why they have taken such a drastic step as _Pathalgadi_
to register their resistance to the state. They surely would tell the
government the reasons why and also the fact that they are doing
this within the letter and spirit of the Indian Constitution; and
hence, theirs is not a secessionist movement but a resolve for
local self-governance. However, unfortunately, my and other similar
pleadings fell on deaf ears. More than a year passed, and no action
was initiated by the government except increasing police repression,
which has disrupted the normal and peaceful lives of people.

Suddenly in June 2019, soon after the present ruling party came back
to power at the centre, the buried FIR was unearthed and an order
was passed to arrest those named in the FIRs. Some of us approached
the High Court of Jharkhand to quash the unjust FIRs. Hearings of
these cases have been postponed time and again with no justice in
sight.

Now, a zeroing-in process is afoot. From among the 20 of us, five
have been pin-pointed and arrest warrants issued by the Khunti
magistrate's court. My name tops the list. Soon thereafter, the same
court proclaimed me 'an absconder', whereas I have not even been
served an arrest warrant up until now. When this anomaly was
pointed out by my lawyers in the HC, the police promptly pasted
the 'absconder' notice on the front wall of my room at _Bagaicha_.
The latest development is that the same magistrate court issued an
'attach property' notification against me. I, as a Jesuit, do not own
any movable or immovable property. Prompt came the police action.
In the last week of October 2019, the Jharkhand police raided my
workplace-cum-residence and took away all my personal belongings
including a cupboard, a table, three chairs, and a mattress-cum-pillow.
Only a bare cot was left in my room. I am, now, left with my body,
mind, conscience, and of course, the overwhelming solidarity from
numerous friends, colleagues, and kith and kin. I am grateful to them
all.

Why the Jharkhand police is so eager to single me out is a relevant
question. Why the judiciary at the district and state levels are bending
over backwards to oblige the police/government is another vexing
question. Arguments that sought the quashing of the FIR were over;
the HC judge, who had been dealing the case, was about to give his
order; but suddenly the judge was changed and the first thing the new
judge did, was to remove the interim relief from arrest given by the
previous judge and to give a date for the next hearing; but when the
hearing was about to begin, the state's Advocate General objected
to the hearing and it was dropped by the judge ... What does this all
mean?

Just now, our main petition challenging the FIR has been put on hold,
but the police's FIR against us, accusing us of provoking the _Adivasis_
in the _Pathalgadi_ movement to violence, has come to centre stage. The
affidavit-cum-annexures submitted to the court are all geared towards
establishing my alleged nexus to the Bhima-Koregaon case, meaning
my alleged _Maoist_ connections, and have little to do with the _Pathalgadi_
case. The ultimate purpose seems to be to paint the _Adivasis_' peaceful
assertion for self-governance as a _Maoist_-inspired revolt against the
Indian state.

**They say, 'Truth will finally prevail'... but how long is it going to
take ... and how much damage is being done in the process ...
Questions to ponder.**
