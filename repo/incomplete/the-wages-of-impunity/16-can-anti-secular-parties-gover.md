# Can Anti-Secular Parties Govern?

Can any party govern India without subscribing to secular values? Is
democratic governance possible without recognising the claims to
equality by the minorities? Can they be accorded the status of
citizenship in a theocratic state? The Constituent Assembly grappled
with these and related questions.[^165] The consensus that emerged was
that India should continue to be a plural society and that its
governance should recognise the plurality of religions, both within the
Hindu system and outside of it. They were concerned that the identity of
the minorities and other ethnic groups should be preserved. H.V. Kamath
proposed an amendment prefixing 'In the name of God' to the draft
Preamble. It was one of those rare occasions when the Assembly actually
divided by show of hands. The ayes eventually lost 41 to 68, after the
opponents pointed out that the invocation of God was inconsistent with
freedom of faith, which was not only promised in the Preamble, but was
also guaranteed as a fundamental right. Later, when a similar proposal
was made for an invocation in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights,
India and other countries voted against it.

With the recent examples before them of the Nazi and fascist
dictatorships and their unimaginable and merciless destruction of human
lives, India voted against a presidential type of executive so as to
avoid the possibility of dictators surfacing. Parliamentary democracy, a
colonial legacy, was a more familiar option. The founding fathers
bequeathed a sovereign democratic republic to future generations.
Twenty-five years after Independence, however, our democratic republic
is almost lost.

A degenerate electoral system and a weakened revolutionary movement have
made the courts an arena for political struggle. It is interesting how
the struggle between authoritarian trends and the democratic forces
rallying against these trends have been deftly portrayed as a
confrontation between the courts and Parliament. Repeated amendments to
the Constitution, the courts feared, would change the nation into a
periodically elected monarchy, with the elected representatives becoming
representatives of despotism. The court therefore evolved the doctrine
of 'prospective overruling'.[^166] Five years thereafter, when
democracy had almost disappeared, another property litigation led to a
re-examination of amendment powers, specifically the earlier doctrine of
_prospective overruling_. _Kesavananda Bharati_ gave us the all-encompassing
doctrine of 'Basic Structure of the Constitution' and the related
doctrine of 'Implied Limitation'.[^167] Although the court joined the
authoritarian regime in incarcerating liberty, it simultaneously ensured
that no future amendments could change the Constitution to the
disadvantage of the people.

Liberated from authoritarian rule, we are now in the clutches of
theocratic forces. These same forces sided with Jaya Prakash Narayan
during Emergency. Wearing the garb of liberal democrats, they entered
the power structure of the anarchic Janata leadership. This anarchy in
governance and parliamentary politics in the post-Rajiv Gandhi era was
perpetuated by successive governments, headed in turn by P.V. Narasimha
Rao. Deve Gowda and I.K. Gujral. After the political burlesque enacted
in Parliament by Deve Gowda and Gujral, secularism as a political value
was so devalued that the ground was cleared for the theocratic forces to
make an entry into parliamentary politics as a major player. Again it
was during this period, when secularism became trivialised to minor
status in politics, that it became a major issue before the Supreme
Court. In _S.R. Bommai_,[^168] two issues, both central to democratic
governance, came up for adjudication: (1) the extent of permissible
judicial review of the satisfaction of the President in matters of
dismissal of state governments and the imposition of President's rule;
and (2) the scope and ambit of secularism and its role in governance,
The court pointed out that despite the absence of the words 'socialist'
and 'secular' in the Preamble, the Constitution was secular. What was
implicit was made explicit and thus put beyond debate. The character of
the polity and the role of contending political parties in matters of
its governance was clearly set out. No ruling party could, by this
argument, bring a theocratic state into existence, either directly or
indirectly.

The secular state that is structured by the Constitution has to accord
equal treatment to all religions and religious sects, and the state is
strictly barred from showing any bias towards any religion or sect.
Similarly, the encroachment of religion into secular activity is equally
prohibited. The learned judges pointed out:

> The Founding Fathers could not have countenanced the idea of treating
> minorities as second-class citizens. On the contrary, the dominant
> thinking appears to be that the majority community, Hindus, must be
> secular and thereby help the minorities to become secular. For it is
> the majority community alone that can provide the sense of security
> for others.[^169]

The purpose of law in plural societies, the Court went on to point out:

> is not the progressive assimilation of minorities in the majoritarian
> milieu. This would not solve the problem, but would vainly seek to
> dissolve it.[^170]

The Court warned that if religion is overemphasised, social disunity is
bound to erupt, leading to national disintegration:

> Secularism therefore is part of the fundamental law and the basic
> structure of the Indian political system to secure all its people
> socio-economic needs essential for man's excellence and moral
> well-being, fulfilment of material prosperity and political
> justice.[^171]

This ruling was rendered in the backdrop of Ayodhya, the _Rath Yatra_, and
the Babri Masjid and ensuing riots in Mumbai and other places. The court
referred to Section 123, Subsections 3 and 3A, of the Representation of
the People Act, 1951, and pointed out that election law also bars
religion as the basis of electoral politics.

It is in the context of the law as expounded by the Supreme Court in
_S.R. Bommai_ that the competence and legitimacy of the BJP, its outfits
and the Shiv Sena to participate in this country's politics must be
questioned. Professing theocratic principles or propounding the Hindu
religion as the ruling religion of the state disentitles these parties
from continuing in power. Both the religious majority and the religious
minorities are prohibited from using religion-based politics for secular
purposes, which of course would include elections to all the
representative institutions:

> It \[secularism\] enables people to see the imperative requirements for
> human progress in all aspects and cultural and social advancement, and
> indeed for human survival itself. It also not only improves the
> material conditions of human life, but also liberates the human spirit
> from the bondage of ignorance, suppression, irrationality, injustice,
> fraud, hypocrisy and oppressive exploitation.[^172]

Not so vacuous after all. In the light of such an exposition of
secularism in _S.R. Bommai_, will it be possible for the BJP to continue
in power lawfully?

part of the independence struggle, nor did they participate in the
deliberations of the Constituent Assembly.
