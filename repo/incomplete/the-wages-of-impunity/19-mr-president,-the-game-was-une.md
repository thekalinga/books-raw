Albert Camus makes a valid point when he says that no government has the
moral right to invoke the absolute power of taking away the life of any
of its citizens for the reason that it or its courts judges them to be
evil. He points out that society precedes sovereignty to eliminate evil
ones as if it represented virtue incarnate:

> To assert, in any case, that a man must be cut off from society
> because he is absolutely evil amounts to saying that society is
> absolutely good, and no one in his right mind will believe this
> today.[^181]

Indian society today is far from free of violence, crime, and unjust and
iniquitous practices. The government is run by persons who abuse the
offices they hold. Several of them have criminal records. Given this
background, have state or union legislatures any moral competence to
pass laws that mandate a death sentence? Do our governments have the
moral authority to impose and execute a death sentence?

It would be useful at this point to look at the record of governmental
activity. Thousands of Sikhs have been slaughtered, many during the
period when Sikh separatism was at its peak and even more after Indira
Gandhi's assassination in 1984. How quickly were arrests made and how
many charge-sheets have been filed since that time? How many convictions
were secured and after how many years? What happened to the massacre of
young Sikh students in Bidar, Karnataka, in 1987? Again, how many
arrests were made and what is the nature of the convictions secured? In
both these cases, our governments and politicians have sponsored and
abetted mass murder. In Padirikuppam in the state of Andhra Pradesh,
_Dalits_ were mauled and their meagre livestock and property consigned to
flames in 1982. How many arrests did the police make immediately after
the incident? How many were prosecuted and with what result? In
Karamchedu in 1985, around six _Dalit_ men were killed and three women
were raped in broad daylight. The _Dalits_ organised themselves and
undertook a militant campaign for justice. Because of their dogged
pursuit of the prosecution, six persons were sentenced to life in
prison. The sentence awarded was not death, because killing _Dalits_ can
never come within the definition of 'rarest of rare cases'. But neither
did the _Dalits_ ask for an enhancement of sentence. The culture of the
oppressed has always been superior to that of the oppressor. Of all the
atrocities perpetrated on _Dalits_, Tsunduru was the worst. People were
killed, packed into gunny sacks and thrown into a canal. The culprits
are all still at large, having twice stalled the proceedings
successfully by approaching the High Court.[^182] None of these
instances are less horrendous than the crime committed by Chalapathi and
Vijayavardhana Rao, for which they were sentenced to death.

Criminal law has always been a political weapon in the hands of the
state. Several members of our legislative bodies have criminal records:
both white collar crime and the bloody variety. Our law enforcers have
for long been responsible for the deaths of suspects in their custody.
These suspects very often come from economically and socially deprived
strata. There has never been any accountability for these deaths. They
also kill people in 'encounters', a euphemism for extra-judicial
killings. Their disregard for the law results in a conflation of
impunity with immunity.

At a time when tolerance to this enveloping criminality in governance
and administration has become a habit, it is untenable to insist on
carrying out death sentences on the ground of legality, when all the
fundamental assumptions, social and moral, underlying that legality have
crumbled. The assumptions undergirding legality provide the reasons for
respecting the law. These assumptions are found in the Preamble, the
Directive Principles, and the Fundamental Duties enshrined in the
Constitution. These should inform our understanding of governance and
administration. The criterion of shared morality by which a deterrent
sentence was imposed on Chalapathi and Vijayavardhan Rao has become a
myth in the contemporary context. Can we with confidence assert that the
crimes with which a former prime minister and his cabinet colleague are
accused are less heinous than the one committed by the unfortunate two
rotting in jail awaiting execution? Can we assert that this prime
minister was acting according to constitutional norms and propriety when
he attempted to bribe members of parliament to change the course of a
no-confidence motion to preserve himself in power? Take the case of a
chief minister of Tamil Nadu who accumulated massive wealth at the
expense of the state exchequer. Or that of another chief minister who
appropriated several hundred crores of rupees that had been allotted to
dairy programmes?[^183] It is possible to argue that according to law
these acts would amount to cheating and, if misappropriation is added,
would even be compoundable. Is there any moral or legal justification to
subsume the homicidal activities of law-enforcing agencies under 'law
and order'? It may become impossible to obey rules that are disregarded
by those charged with their enforcement; at some point the reason to
obey disappears. Fuller observes very pertinently that in such
situations the citizen's predicament becomes difficult; where there is
no total failure in any direction, there is a general and drastic
deterioration in legality, as is witnessed today. There is no simple
principle to test a citizen's obligation to obey the law, nor can we
assert that implied in such a situation there is a right to engage in a
general revolution. Fuller stresses the point with a stark illustration,
which is certainly within the realm of possibility. Supposing Parliament
were to pass a law that all its members are henceforth not subject to
any laws and are authorised to rob, kill and rape without any legal
penalty; and that any interference with such actions is a crime
punishable by a mandatory death sentence; what advice should one give
convicts? Should they claim that their right to equality has been
violated![^184] This telling illustration given by Fuller to demolish
Dicey's theory of parliamentary sovereignty applies equally to assessing
in the contemporary situation, the legitimacy of authority to sentence
persons accused of capital offences.

Even under normal conditions, the death sentence can only be imposed in
the rarest of rare cases. But where crime has become a part of
parliamentary practice and a tool of administration as well, to maintain
the rhetoric of community values and to argue in favour of the
imperative necessity of the death sentence as a form of deterrence would
be to endorse partisan positions and to affirm as valid a principle
devoid of context. In our inexorable journey towards anomie,
opportunities present themselves every now and then for introspection
and reassessment of constitutional norms and values. Such an exercise
should enable us to even reverse course. The sentence presently pending
consideration for clemency is one such opportunity.[^185] In fact, the
government's loss of credibility should be given out as the reason for
grant of clemency. Otherwise their petition for clemency becomes an
indictment, for they seem to be saying:
