# Personal Liberty after Independence

Nehru described the advent of 15 August 1947 as our 'tryst with
destiny'. The Madras government released all its prisoners on that day,
except A.K. Gopalan. He was in solitary confinement. He celebrated
India's independence within the jail premises. Joined by some of his
fellow prisoners, he walked the length of jail carrying the national
flag. Hoisting it on the roof of the third block, he addressed those
gathered there for four or five minutes. For his performance, he was
produced before the ADM Calicut on a charge of sedition for stirring up
the people against His Majesty the Emperor. Like Gandhi and Tilak, he
too made a statement before the court, but in independent India:

> I am proud that I am being tried for creating enmity against the
> legally constituted Emperor of British India. All freedom lovers in
> this country and the leaders of the freedom movement from its birth,
> like Nehru, Gandhi and such leaders, have tried to create enmity
> against the Emperor's Government. Mahatma Gandhi has been proceeded
> against under Section 124-A IPC for working towards the same end.
>
> As a result of all this, His Majesty's Government and British India
> have ceased to exist today. Many of my colleagues who committed the
> same crime along with me have become Ministers and Governors. There is
> some incongruity in bringing me to trial at this time when on the face
> of it we have just achieved freedom. I am sorry that things should
> have come to such a pass.[^23]

The government was represented by K.P. Ramunni Menon. For the magistrate
and the public prosecutor, nothing appeared incongruous. They were not
able to see any break. Governance for them was a continuous process and
the principles of governance set up by the British in India were seen as
appropriate and relevant for free India. The advent of Independence was
just an event which did not disturb continuity; it did not announce a
change in the existing social order. However, A.K. Gopalan was released
on October 12, 1947, only to be re-arrested on December 17 and this time
under a preventive detention law. When the Constitution came into force,
Gopalan continued in detention. If the Indian government had remedied
the wrong done to Gopalan, the legal profession would have been deprived
of its first major precedent after Independence. It is our own. It is
the first Indian-made foreign judgement

When Gopalan sent a petition from jail to the Supreme Court, his
detention was brought under the Preventive Detention Act, 1950, which
came into force on 26 February 1950.[^24] There was no debate about
continued incarceration even after Independence; there was no reference
to the freedom struggle, which should instruct all such debates. The
violation of Gopalan's personal liberty was described as a restriction
of his freedom of movement. This debate led to the question, in the case
of preventive detention, whether a detainee can complain that his
detention is invalid as it violates Article 19. Chief Justice Kania said
that Article 19 should be read as separate and complete. According to
him, the Constitution authorises legislation on preventive detention in
normal times, even as a permanent measure. Parliament's power to
legislate and deprive personal liberty is very wide. The maximum period
of detention was not fixed under the 1950 act, and when this was
questioned as arbitrary, the answer was that if such a construction is
correct,

> the courts can do nothing to reduce the rigour ... It is difficult upon
> any general principles to limit the omnipotence of the sovereign
> legislative power by judicial interposition.[^25]

By opting for the expression 'procedure established by law' at the draft
stage instead of a due process clause, the Constitution gave the
legislature the final word in determining the law, said Kania. When this
article was debated in the Constituent Assembly, Alladi Krishnaswami
Ayyar was at pains to point out the pitfalls in adopting the expression
'due process'. He briefly touched upon the abuses it could be subject to
and apprehended that such a clause may be highjacked by vested interests
to obstruct all social welfare legislation, which in any event happened.
He felt that

> it might prove fairly satisfactory if the judges of the Supreme Court
> in India did not follow American precedents, especially in the early
> stages, but moulded their interpretation to suit Indian conditions and
> the progress and well-being of the country.[^26]

This was a plea for evolving our own jurisprudence. He felt that three
or five gentlemen sitting in a court pronouncing what 'due process' is
all about cannot be more democratic than the expressed will of the
representatives of the people, or an executive responsible to such
representatives. Most of the members were, however, against the
expression 'procedure established by law'.

Ambedkar did not rule out the possibility of a legislature getting
packed with their supporters by the party in power; nor was he able to
assert his confidence in the judges who formed the courts. He declared,
'It is rather a case where a man has to sail between Charybdis and
Scylla,' and abstained from endorsing any view. Since many members felt
that Article 21 hands a blank cheque to the executive, they introduced
Article 15A (which is the present Article 22), which declared that

> nobody can be held in detention for more than twenty-four hours
> without being produced before the nearest magistrate. The person
> arrested has a right to know the grounds for his arrest and he has a
> right to be represented by a lawyer of his choice.[^27]

This is the first part of the article. The second part legitimises
preventive detention by providing what was at that time thought of as a
limitation on the powers of arrest. This limitation was interpreted as a
power by the court in _Gopalan_. Says the court:

> There is no authoritative definition of the term 'Preventive Detention'
> in Indian law ... The object is not to punish a man for having done
> something but to intercept him before he does it and to prevent him
> from doing it. No offence is proved, nor any charge formulated; and
> the justification of such detention is suspicion or reasonable
> probability, and not criminal conviction which can only be warranted
> by legal evidence ... [^28]

that an offence posing a threat to public order or to the security of
the state is likely to be committed.

It is widely believed that the court upheld by a majority the preventive
detention law in its entirety, that is, Article 22 is a separate and
self-contained code barring reference to other rights in the majority
view of the bench in Gopalan's case. But this was disputed subsequently
in the Bank Nationalisation case.[^29] Seervai also argues
conclusively that Justice Mahajan alone of all the judges in Gopalan
held that Article 22 was a complete code.[^30] Yet, arbitrary power
wearing the garb of a statute may satisfy the test of procedure
established by law, and the Indian government, which has been in
perpetual insurrection against its own people, desired that the court
should endorse its attempt to abrogate the minimal value system
contained in the Constitution by incarcerating personal liberty and
suspending political justice. Both the government and the court ignored
the value of the principles of governance set out in Part IV of the
Constitution and thus liberated themselves from the responsibility of
being socially relevant.[^31] Subclause 4(a) of Article 22 makes it
obligatory, in the first instance, not to detain a person for more than
three months, and if such person is to be detained beyond this period,
the matter has to go before a duly constituted advisory board for an
opinion. Subclause 7(a) dispenses with the requirement for an advisory
board when the statute authorising preventive detention stipulates the
circumstances under which, or the class or classes of cases in which a
person is to be detained beyond three months. Section 12 of the
Preventive Detention Act, 1950, deriving its source from Subclause 7 of
Article 22, laid down that persons who according to the detaining
authority are acting or likely to act prejudicially (a) to the defence
of India, the relations of India with foreign powers or the security of
India, or (b) the security of the state or public order, can be detained
for a period beyond three months and not beyond one year without
reference to an advisory board.

The expressions used indicate that this section applies only to
political dissent. The terms 'defence of India', 'relations with foreign
powers', and 'security of India' refer to fields of legislation
exclusively of Parliament. Public order and security of state are fields
of legislation in the concurrent list. A mere enumeration of these
politically loaded expressions in the 1950 act may not comply with the
requirements stipulated in Article 22(7). The power under 22(7) is
drastic; it should be treated as an exception. Legal grammar, in this
instance, abrogated liberty, and the court endorsed as valid the
incarceration of political dissidents without any accountability.

The apprehensions expressed by the members came true. Bakshi Tekchand,
for instance, described Articles 22(4) to (7) as reactionary. According
to him, there was no written constitution in the world which contained
such provisions for the detention of persons without trial in normal
times. Mahavir Tyagi pointed out that the

> adoption of Article 15A would change the chapter on fundamental rights
> into 'a penal code worse than the Defence of India Rules of the old
> Government.'[^32]

It was reiterated that the Constituent Assembly was gathered there to
ensure rights to the people, not to denude them of their rights. Despite
this debate and the apprehensions expressed, soon after the Constitution
came into force and almost immediately after the President was sworn in,
the Preventive Detention (Extending the Duration) Order was promulgated
to ensure the continuance of the public safety and public security
measures enacted by the British Indian government. Four High
Courts --- Patna, Calcutta, Orissa and Hyderabad --- where this order was
made an issue, struck it down as invalid.[^33] Immediately thereafter,
the Preventive Detention Act, 1950, was brought into existence. Like the
British, politicians and political parties in independent India
continued to define governance in terms of power.

But there was one judge in the history of the Supreme Court who
understood the Constitution in terms of the people and their struggles.
Construing the same provision, namely Article 22(7), with specific
reference to whether the direction contained therein, that Parliament by
law may fix the maximum period of detention, Justice Vivian Bose said:

> Brush aside for a moment the pettifogging of the law & forget for the
> nonce \[sic\] all the learned disputations about this & that, & 'and'
> or 'or' or 'may' & 'must'. Look past the mere verbiage of the words &
> penetrate deep into the heart & spirit of the Constitution. What sort
> of State are we intended to be? Have we not here been given a way of
> life, the right to individual freedom, the utmost the State can confer
> in that respect consistent with its own safety? Is not the sanctity of
> the individual recognised & emphasised again & again? Is not our
> Constitution in violent contrast to those of States where the State is
> everything & the individual but a slave or a serf to serve the will of
> those who for the time being wield almost absolute power? I have no
> doubts on this score.[^34]

He was all along aware that he was dealing with the case of a communist,
and found it ironical that he should uphold the freedoms of a class of
persons who, 'if rumour is to be accredited and if the list of their
activities furnished to us is a true guide, would be the first to
destroy them if they but had the power.' The one test of belief in
principles is to apply it to cases with which you have no sympathy at
all. Bose's attitude to personal liberty was refreshingly wholesome and
courageous. He alone of all the judges present and past understood the
Constitution in terms of the people, their struggles, and the necessity
of ensuring the rights secured by them in the course of their struggles:

> I cannot bring myself to believe that the framers of our Constitution
> intended that the liberties guaranteed should be illusory &
> meaningless or that they could be toyed with by this person or that.
> They did not bestow on the people of India a cold, lifeless, inert
> mass of malleable clay but created a living organism, breathed life
> into it & endowed it with purpose & vigour so that it should grow
> healthily & sturdily in the democratic way of life, which is the free
> way. In the circumstances, I prefer to decide in favour of the freedom
> of the subject.
>
> I am not hampered here by considerations of war necessity or emergency
> legislation where some authorities hold that the canons of
> construction are different & that allowance must be made in favour of
> the State for imperfections of language used in legislation which had
> to be drafted & enacted in a desperate hurry with the State in dire &
> immediate peril. I am construing a Constitution which was hammered out
> solemnly & deliberately after the most mature consideration & with the
> most anxious care ... After all, who framed the Constitution & for
> whose benefit was it made? --- not just for those in brief authority, not
> only for lawyers & dialecticians but for the common people of India.
> It should, therefore, be construed, when that can be done without
> doing violence to the language employed, in a simple, straightforward
> way so that it makes sense to the man in the street, so that the
> common people of the land can follow & understand its meaning. To my
> mind, the whole concept of the Constitution is that after years of
> bitter struggle the citizens of India are assured that certain
> liberties shall be guaranteed to them & these liberties cannot be
> curtailed beyond limits which they & all the world can know & which
> can only be fixed by the highest authority in the land, Parliament
> itself, directly & specifically after affording opportunity for due
> deliberation in that august body.[^35]

To the man in the street the niceties of law and grammar have no
relevance, he said. Speaking against the majority view that Parliament
need not specify the maximum duration of detention, he pointed out that
the Constitution as interpreted tells the people:

> Though we authorise Parliament to prescribe a maximum limit of
> detention if it so chooses, we place no compulsion on it to do so & we
> authorise it to pass legislation which will empower any person or
> authority Parliament chooses to name, right down to a police
> constable, to arrest you & detain you as long as he pleases, for the
> duration of his life if he wants, so that you may linger & rot in jail
> till you die, as did men in the Bastille.[^36]

Fifty years later, this remains a comprehensive criticism of preventive
detention from the angle of the people. Bose alone understood that words
were mere symbols and indeed a gloss, and that the prolonged struggle
for independence should form the key to understanding the Constitution
and the laws affecting freedom. Therefore, he declared, it is rights
that are fundamental and not the limitations on freedom. The approach of
the majority in this case stems from the assumption that the
administration should be adversarial to the people, that freedoms are
granted and therefore subject to withdrawal, which would also imply
curtailment.

If one looks at the Preamble to the Constitution, this is made quite
clear:

> We, the people of India, having solemnly resolved to constitute India
> into a Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic Republic and to secure
> to all its citizens:
>
> |    Justice, social, economic and political;
>
> |    Liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship;
>
> |    Equality of status and of opportunity;
> 
> and to promote among them all
>
> |    Fraternity, assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and
> integrity of the Nation;

The words 'to secure' could not have been used in the sense 'to obtain'.
They can only mean that we were going to constitute a state in which our
concepts of justice, equality and liberty, for which we had waged a
struggle, would remain secure. They would be protected and safeguarded.

Is such a legislation on the statute books in tune with the
constitutional value system, and more particularly the statement in the
Directives that political justice should inform all the institutions of
the state? When the matter was brought before the Supreme Court by
Gopalan, the preventive detention act was a temporary measure, for one
year only, initially. After the Supreme Court upheld its validity, there
has not been a debate at the political level, and the act was renewed
quite mechanically for almost nineteen years. One does not need to be in
Parliament to oppose such measures. One can oppose them by mobilising
public opinion to bring pressure on the state.

The courts never recognised the political content of liberty in their
discourse while adjudicating the validity of the restraints to be
imposed on personal liberty. The Preamble and every expression used
there, the rights enumerated in Part III, and the fundamental
obligations, are primarily political concepts. The failure to recognise
this has led the courts to embark on puerile disquisitions and debates
on constitutional questions, ignoring the transformative use of the
words and expressions in the Preamble, the Fundamental Rights, and the
Directives. Progress towards the very minimal programmes set out in the
Directives has been obstructed. For over a decade and a half the
Directives were not assigned any interpretive role, and the principles
of governance set out therein were not perceived as having a
transformative role.

Absent this perception, every issue raised, every dissent and every
political movement was looked upon as a law and order or public order
problem, and dealt with accordingly. Every democratic protest and
dissent was driven underground. As a result, even the long tenure of the
Preventive Detention Act, 1950, was found inadequate when the Indo--China
war broke out on 8 September 1962.

The President issued a proclamation under Article 352 of the
Constitution declaring a state of emergency on account of external
aggression.[^37] On the same day, the Defence of India Ordinance came
into existence. On November 3, 1962, the President notified under
Article 359(1) the suspension of rights under Articles 21 and 22 of the
Constitution, namely the right to life and personal liberty, and
protection against arbitrary arrest and detention. Article 19, which
gives citizens the right to free speech and expression and the freedom
of assembly and association, stood suspended. On November 11, Article
14, the right to equality was suspended. These rights form the sheet
anchor of Part III of the Constitution of India and their suspension was
in reality a declaration that the rule of law had been disbanded.

The Supreme Court, by declaring that a challenge to the preventive
detention law can only be on the grounds of a violation of Article 22
and not on any other grounds, authorised restraint and forfeiture of
liberty without invoking emergency powers. Despite this, a state of
emergency was declared and communists were arrested on a large scale.
They again approached the court, complaining that their detention under
the Defence of India Act, 1963, and other rules was in contravention of
Articles 14, 21 and 22.[^38] Liberty was once again outlawed. The
judges held that a citizen's right to challenge the validity of a law
accrued to him or her on account of the Constitution and the Fundamental
Rights, which fortunately were included in the Constitution.

This reasoning is somewhat unhistorical. A constitution is a political
document which gives legal content to a set of preexisting rights,
secured politically by peoples' struggles. Rights have always been
acquired, never granted. Freedom was acquired by the people from the
British and not granted to us by the Indian Independence Act of 1947.
There was no effort made to redefine concepts in tune with the
constitutional value system, and so we find the courts falling back on
the colonial response to similar situations, whether the British were
ruling us or their own country. Thus we find the court saying in _Makhan
Singh_:

The right to challenge the validity of a statute on the ground that it
contravenes the fundamental rights of the citizens has accrued to the
citizens of this country only after and as a result of the provisions of
the Constitution itself ... [^39]

It therefore follows that if the fundamental rights are suspended, or if
the values written into the Constitution are abrogated, no complaint can
be made, because the Constitution which gave us these rights, has ceased
to operate.[^40]

So far as personal liberty is concerned, the courts validated executive
unlawfulness, despite the injunction contained in Article 13(2), which
reads:

> The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the
> rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of
> this clause shall, to the extent of this contravention, be void

Obviously relying on this provision, Shamrao Vishnu Parulekar, arguing
his own case, contended that the court may not have the authority by
virtue of a declaration of emergency and the consequent presidential
order to order his release, but this need not prevent it from declaring
that the detentions made were illegal.[^41] The unqualified and
unreservedly mandatory character of Article 13(2) did not make any
difference to the court. It went on to say:

> It appeared that as regards the validity of the impugned provisions of
> the Act and the Rules, he (the Attorney General) was not in a position
> to challenge the contention of the appellants that the Act contravened
> Articles 14, 21, and 22(4), (5) and (7). Even so, he (the Attorney
> General) strongly pressed before us his original contention that we
> would not reach the stage of expressing our opinion on the validity of
> the Act if we were to uphold the preliminary objection that the
> applications made by the detenues were incompetent.[^42]

The court upheld the preliminary objection, as according to the
majority, that was the only course the court could logically and with
propriety adopt. Perhaps this rule of procedure was originally conceived
as a step towards reducing arbitrariness and eliminating whimsicality
and caprice in the decision-making process. But it has been slowly
subverted in its usage to supersede constitutional rights and to
liberate the executive from the limitations imposed by the Constitution.
This subversion became normal practice and also appeared logical. For
Justice Subba Rao, the lone dissenter, the majority view appeared
abnormal. He rightly pointed out:

> I cannot for a moment attribute to the august body, the Parliament,
> the intention to make solemnly void laws. It may have made the present
> impugned Act _bona fide_, thinking that it is sanctioned by the
> provisions of the Constitution. Whatever it may be, the result is we
> have now a void Act on the statute book, and under that Act the
> appellants before us have been detained illegally ... The tendency to
> ignore the rule of law is contagious, and, if our Parliament, which
> unwittingly made a void law, not only allows it to remain on the
> statute book, but also permits it to be administered by the executive,
> the contagion may spread to the people, and the habit of lawlessness,
> like other habits, dies hard.[^43]

The licence granted to state lawlessness was disturbing. Appearing for
the appellants, Setalvad expressed the apprehension that legitimising
this lawlessness might lead to abuse of power by the executive, an abuse
against which the citizens may not have any remedy. The contention for
the majority of the learned judges appeared to be a political question
and its impact on constitutional questions was, according to them, at
best indirect:

> In a democratic State the effective safeguard against abuse of
> executive powers, whether in peace or in emergency, is ultimately to
> be found in the existence of enlightened, vigilant and vocal public
> opinion.[^44]

Having said this, they discharged themselves from the responsibility of
being an enlightened, vigilant and vocal institution set up to ensure
that the rule of law and democracy informs all the activities of the
state as well as society.

The members of the constituent assembly were not quite clear as to what
role the Directives should be assigned, as they were declared not
enforceable by the courts. Ambedkar alone felt that the Directives
provided the minimum political programme for political parties competing
for power, and added prophetically that the importance of these
Directives would be realised in the event of a 'take over' by the right.
These are in reality indispensable principles of governance around which
administrative law ought to have been structured. This part of the
Constitution never played its role and therefore, as early as the 1970s,
justice in all its enumerated facets was non-existent.

While the court validated the policy of restraint on personal liberty,
it took on the role of an adversary when the government tried to disarm
the strong, as if to confirm what Anatole France said: 'Justice is the
means by which established injustices are sanctioned.'[^45]
Immediately after the country secured independence, the government
headed by the Congress wanted to dismantle rural India's feudal
structure. Accordingly, several states enacted laws abolishing the
_zamindari_ system and the subfeudal structures which the former gave rise
to. The Patna High Court, however, struck down the state legislation.
Before the matter was taken to the Supreme Court, the First
Constitutional Amendment Act, 1951, was brought into force. This
introduced Articles 31A and 31B, which grant immunity to any state
legislation passed for the acquisition of any estate or any rights in
such estate or which extinguishes or modifies any such right, from any
attack in the courts on the grounds of violating Articles 14, 19 and 31.
Article 31B, read with the Ninth Schedule, was unequivocal in its
intention: namely, no act included in the Ninth Schedule can be
invalidated on the ground that the law or any of its provisions are
violative of any of the fundamental rights. The language used is of a
much wider sweep than the emergency provisions, which suspended only
some of the fundamental rights. Article 31B negates Article 13(2) of the
Constitution, which declares as invalid all laws passed in contravention
of the fundamental rights chapter. Despite this sweep in language, the
Supreme Court, in _Kameshwar Singh_, struck down the principal provisions
of the legislation, notwithstanding the First Constitutional Amendment
Act of 1951.[^46]

Any attempt at restructuring the social order was stalled continuously
from the beginning. Statutes were questioned and amendments to the
Constitution were brought into force, and even these were questioned. By
the time we enter the second decade of the Constitution, we find
increasing signs of a totalitarian system of governance, for example the
blocking of even minimal reform measures introduced by the government,
without which the country could not be peacefully governed. In the words
of Justice Hidayatullah in _Golak Nath_:

> I am apprehensive that the erosion of the right to property may be
> practised against other Fundamental Rights ... Small inroads lead to
> larger inroads ... [^47]

This realisation came only when the right to property was put in issue.
The Supreme Court waxed eloquent about democracy and the rule of law in
the privy purses case.[^48] While the right to property was
registering victories in the courts, restraints on personal liberty had
the approval of the courts.

Jawaharlal Nehru died in May 1964. Political leadership of the Congress
party became problematic. Lal Bahadur Shastri, a compromise candidate,
was chosen for a brief period of 19 months before he died in office in
January 1966. Senior Congress leaders from the states, known as the
Syndicate, presided over the selection of the next prime minister. Their
choice fell on Nehru's daughter, Indira Gandhi, overlooking the strong
contender Morarji Desai. In elections held within the parliamentary
party, Desai was resoundingly defeated. Thus began a period of
de-institutionalisation. Congress politics, equated with national
politics from the British period, continued to remain so even after
independence. When Nehru talked of India's 'tryst with destiny', he
perhaps meant his party's tryst.[^49] Indira Gandhi was elected the
leader of the party. On 15 December 1966, Parliament passed the
Preventive Detention (Continuance) Act, 1966, extending the life of the
act up to 31 December 1969. In February 1967, the Congress, which had
ruled there all along, lost elections in five states and its governments
were toppled in three others following defections.

Despite these major reverses, Indira Gandhi consolidated her position
within the party by driving out the Syndicate. This struggle for power
was given the gloss of an ideological battle against reactionary forces,
and the faction led by Indira Gandhi was described as progressive. The
alliance with the Soviet Union provided a revolutionary edge to her
populist rhetoric. Since it might have been politically disastrous for
the Congress to continue implementing the preventive detention law
legislated by Parliament after losing power in eight states, its
government invited the views of the state governments. The central
government was of the view that an extension of two years would suffice.
All the state governments were in favour of extending the act for a
further period of three years. This included the left-wing governments
of West Bengal and Kerala.[^50] The central government later dropped
the idea of continuing the act, as it was felt that the Unlawful
Activities Prevention Act, 1967, could effectively take its place.

But the country was not free from preventive detention laws. After the
electoral defeats of 1967, several states were instructed by the central
government to pass their own preventive detention laws. To name a few,
Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal
had preventive detention acts passed in the year 1970. So far as the
states of West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh were concerned, the ideological
turmoil within the communist Parties in power there ultimately led to
the emergence of the _Naxalbari_ movement, which brought onto the agenda
the concept of armed revolution as the only answer to increasing
exploitation and a corrupt social order. In response to the _Naxalite_
movement, the state structure underwent a fascist transformation while
at the same time maintaining a façade of rule by law. Thus we had the
brutal practice of extra-judicial killings of the movement's activists.
These two states also subverted the legal structure by invoking the
conspiracy charge to rope in as many people as possible. Their
preventive detention laws were in reality used for punitive detention.
Short arrest periods became continuous when the courts validated
repeated re-arrests of the detainees.

The stability of a government depends on the provision of economic
justice, more specifically on distributive justice. But if these are
deficient or progressively diminishing in quantity and content, the
people will organise to secure for themselves the right to life and
livelihood by exercising their constitutional right to free speech,
assembly and association. Failure of governance leads to questioning the
ways of the government, which if unattended, leads to collective action
that may ultimately transform itself into total revolt. This collective
assertion of rights by a people is viewed by the reigning power as a law
and order or public order problem. The tension between power and the
collective assertion of rights, the tension between _status quo_ and
change is described by authorities in terms such as 'law and order',
'public order' and 'security of state'. These expressions have never
been defined. But they have held sway over the country ever since
Independence.

The early years of Independence saw the dismantling of _zamindari_ and
other such feudal practices. But instead of suffering expropriation when
their lands were taken over, the title-holders were adequately
compensated and even allowed to continue to exercise political clout in
their former fiefdoms. Their privileges were protected and they supplied
'representatives of the people' to our democracy. Laws were carefully
drafted to avoid being struck down by the courts. Extreme care was taken
to mollify a handful of people. Even so, the abolition of the estates
was no easy matter. The legal talent that was available to these holders
of unearned property was phenomenal. They even managed to get Dr.
Ambedkar, who had authored and steered the Fundamental Rights chapter of
the Constitution, to appear for one of the _zamindars_ of Bihar! In fact,
the drafting of the Constitution produced a crop of lawyers who halted
or stalled the progress of the country towards its constitutional goal
right from the beginning. No litigation over estates or private property
provided as much wealth to lawyers as the Constitution of this
democratic republic. The administrative system as a whole was not geared
to perform the fundamental obligations of the state set out in the
Directives chapter of the Constitution.

While the first two five-year plans met with some measure of success,
problems started appearing from the third plan onwards. The
concentration of economic power resulting from facilitation of the
growth of big business spelt disaster to India's goal of distributive
justice. The Mahalanobis Committee found that the benefits of a planned
economy and increased governmental expenditure had increasingly flowed
to the upper sector. The economy was in near shambles, with fall in food
production, suspension in 1965 of American aid, and a rise in population
by 100 million by the end of the 1950s. The two wars against China and
Pakistan in 1962 and 1965 added their own stresses to Indian
democracy.[^51] The economic crisis and the wars had their impact on
the politics of the country, leading to the near collapse of liberal
democracy. The fragmentation of the communist movement led to the
emergence of the _Naxalbari_ movement, JP's movement against corruption in
politics, and the Gujarat Navnirman movement, all of which had to be
contained.

It was under these circumstances that Mrs. Gandhi got the Maintenance of
Internal Security Ordinance passed on 30 June 1971, followed by the
Maintenance of Internal Security Act on 2 July 1971. We have already
seen that a state of external emergency was declared in the context of
the Indo--China war on 26 October 1962 under Article 352 of the
Constitution. Simultaneously, the Defence of India Ordinance was brought
into force. This later became the Defence of India Act, 1963. This was
the subject matter of hot debate and contest in the Supreme
Court.[^52] During the period of external emergency, both the
Preventive Detention Act of 1950 (as extended from time to time) and the
Defence of India Act of 1963 were in operation. Both these laws covered
substantially the same field.

This raises the question not of competence but of the propriety of
having more than one law covering the same field. When this was raised
in _Makhan Singh_, Justice Gajendragadkar, expressing the opinion of the
court, upheld the legislation and rejected the contention that
Parliament conducted itself in bad faith. One of the cardinal principles
of interpretation in our courts is that one cannot attribute _mala fides_
to the legislature. The perpetuation of absolute power is covered by a
series of such myths. Obviously, the theory of interpretation needs to
be restructured in terms of the Constitution, its purposes and
objectives.

Traditional theories of interpretation proceed on certain unverified
assumptions. Non-elected judges are chosen as the persons to uncover
legislative intent. By what mechanism do they achieve this? There is no
dearth of instances to demonstrate that the overtly social purposes of
some legislations, which should naturally form legislative intent, have
been ignored while interpreting them. In the matter of personal liberty,
the courts have by and large, as a matter of policy, validated the
conferment of vast powers to the executive. On crucial issues, the
courts interpretations do not read like democratic responses. The
legislative and interpretive history of the more than fifty years after
Independence has been one of curtailing personal liberties, thus
inhibiting the forces of social change from progressing towards
constitutional objectives without violence and the consequent abuse of
power and the construction of a repressive legal framework.

The provisions dealing with a state of emergency call for the suspension
of Article 14 and also bar all enforcement of the other fundamental
rights. The 44th Amendment made Articles 20 and 21 non-derogable, even
during an emergency. We were able to arrive at this position, that even
during a state of emergency certain basic rights are non-derogable,
because of the realities of large-scale abuse of powers during the
Emergency. The subsequent commission of enquiry conducted by Justice
Shah laid bare the abuse of power by almost all branches of the
executive, particularly the law-enforcing agencies.

Apart from principled doubts about the courts' conceptualisation of
rights with constant emphasis on the power of the state, the
decision-making process involving the opinion of various judges from
which a majority has to be culled out) lends itself to confusion. In
countries guided by a constitution, a judge declares what a law means.
Article 141 expressly states that the interpretation of the Supreme
Court is the law of the land. This means, whatever may be the words used
in a statute, the interpretation given by the judges will alone matter
in understanding it. But interpretation, even of words with
ascertainable meanings, gives a large area of discretion to the judges.
The first twenty-five years of interpreting the rights in Part III of
the Constitution show an extraordinary divergence of views between the
judges composing the court at the time of the principal decision and
those interpreting it subsequently. The first decision tells us how to
read and understand a statute or constitutional provision, and the
subsequent decisions tell us how to understand the first decision and
the meaning of the provision or statute interpreted by it. A caricatured
conversation between a jurist and a legislator adequately illustrates
the amount of discretion the courts have:

> We neither know nor care what kind of laws you should make. That
> appertains to the art of legislation, which is foreign to us. Pass
> laws as you wish. Once you have done so, we shall explain to you in
> Latin what kind of law you have passed.[^53]

When the Preventive Detention Act of 1950 was challenged, it was not
attacked in the context of the anti-colonial struggles or the principles
which propelled these struggles. Liberalism and other principles, which
formed the basis for the expositions of John Locke, John Stuart Mill and
other philosophers against absolute monarchy, were used by the Indian
National Congress during its insurgency. Motilal Nehru's presidential
address at Amritsar in the year 1919, the undelivered address of C.R.
Das at the Gaya Congress, Satyamurti's speech in the Central Legislative
Assembly in February 1936, or Gandhi's speech at his sedition trial
before Judge Broomfield are excellent sources for working out a system
of jurisprudence and a theory of rights even at the commencement of the
Constitution. What was subsequently discovered in _Maneka Gandhi_[^54]
in 1978 had already been spelt out in crystal-clear terms, particularly
in Gandhi's speech mentioned above.

A people struggling against oppressive forms of governance will, in the
process, become well versed in politics and the law. The first right a
people under tyranny exercise is associational freedom, which alone
gives them the capacity to articulate their problems and what according
to them are the solutions. Thus, freedom of speech is a necessary
adjunct to associational freedoms, especially the right to form
associations and the right of assembly. In the 34th Congress at Amritsar
in 1919, Motilal Nehru, in his presidential address after the Jalianwala
Bagh massacre, referred among other issues to the brutality of General
Dyer and the Rowlatt Acts, formulating in the process a rights thesis
for the Indian people.[^55] This was immediately after the
Montague--Chelmsford reforms and the Government of India Act. Motilal
Nehru makes an unequivocal demand for a declaration of rights:

> No constitution can meet our needs unless it is accompanied with a
> guarantee and a clear declaration of our elementary rights, which have
> recently been so ruthlessly violated in the Punjab. No Indian can be
> blind to the fact that the protection of our fundamental civic
> liberties is a matter of the most urgent consequence. No statesman can
> shut his eyes to the supreme moral necessity of securing the faith of
> the Indian people in the inviolability of their rights of
> citizenship.[^56]

This was a demand by the colonised, in the context of the reforms
introduced by the British administration in India, for rights they
regarded as a moral imperative for the transformation of a 'subject'
into a citizen. It was also realised that without a change in the status
of a people, the conferment of rights may not be effective. As Motilal
Nehru declared:

> Constitutional reform without free citizenship is like rich attire on
> a dead body. Better to breathe God's free air in rags than be a corpse
> in the finest raiment.[^57]

The concept of rights evolved in the course of struggles from slaves to
subjects to free citizens. The parallel evolution of the means to
control people has been from brutal and naked power to sophisticated
methods. Power continues to be adversarial to rights. The history of
rights has been a continuous attempt to restrain power and achieve a
humane, mature society. The purpose of a theory of rights was not lost
on Motilal Nehru:

> But what is our ultimate goal? We want freedom of thought, freedom of
> action, freedom to fashion our own destiny and build up an India
> suited to the genius of her people.[^58]

He also etches out the purpose to which the exercise of these rights
should be subjected:

> We must aim at an India where all are free and have the fullest
> opportunities of development; where women have ceased to be in
> bondage, and the rigours of the caste system have disappeared; where
> there are no privileged classes or communities; where education is
> free and open to all; where the capitalist and the landlord do not
> oppress the labourer and the ryot; where labour is respected and well
> paid; and poverty, the nightmare of the present generation, is a thing
> of the past.[^59]

C.R. Das's undelivered presidential address to the Congress party's
session at Gaya in 1922 contains a section on law and order that throws
light on the theory of rights in a more fundamental manner. He
emphasises that the enforcement of law and order must be the last resort
of bureaucracies all over the world. The debate continues to this day.
For the bureaucracy, passive obedience is the duty of a subject
(citizen). Non-resistance is the least the government expects from a
citizen, who might as well then be called a subject. After tracing the
history of the British struggle against absolutism, he summarised the
conceptual understanding of law and order and the rights of the people
as follows:

> It follows from the survey that I have made, firstly, that no
> regulation is law unless it is based on the consent of the people;
> secondly, where such consent is wanting, people are under no
> obligation to obey; thirdly, where such laws are not only based on the
> consent of the people but profess to attack their fundamental rights,
> the subjects are entitled to compel their withdrawal by force or
> insurrections; fourthly, that law and order is, and has always been a
> plea for absolutism; and lastly, there can be neither law nor order
> before the real reign of law begins.[^60]

He refers to the report of the committee appointed to examine repressive
laws, and suggests that the absence of consent by a people gives them
the right to disobey laws; where the laws attack fundamental rights the
obligation to them can be dispensed with. He was of the view that the
Prevention of Seditious Meetings Act, 1917, and the Criminal Law
Amendment Act, 1908, by themselves constituted breaches of law and
order. He brings in the concept of 'lawless laws' and declares that the
citizen has a right to 'defy the tyranny of lawless laws.'[^61] While
the U.S. Supreme Court looked towards the American Revolution and the
British looked into their past struggles, our judges never examined what
was written by our leaders during our freedom struggle.

Satyamurti, who was elected to the Central Legislative Assembly in 1934,
introduced there the Repressive Laws Repealing and Amending Bill in
February 1936. This non-official bill, which he introduced soon after
his election, came up before the house in 1936. The statement of objects
and reasons attached to the bill mentions the 'great constitutional
changes taking place towards responsible government,' and therefore
calls upon the assembly to repeal all repressive laws. The approach was
very innovative. He was persuading the British bureaucracy governing
India to repeal all repressive laws, and to commence administration
under the Government of India Act, 1935, with a clean slate. He argues
for relegating the powers of law and order to the provinces, and
therefore strongly pleads for the repeal of all those laws and to amend
the provisions dealing with sedition and the powers under Section 144,
CrPC.[^62] The Constituent Assembly, of course, did not either repeal
or recommend repeal of all British laws passed to counter the struggle
for independence.

The bill introduced by Satyamurti has a very interesting pattern. He
takes Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code and traces all the decisions
on the subject up to the date of debate in the Central Legislative
Assembly. This was the section which was broadly interpreted and widely
used against the principal leaders of the freedom movement. Gandhi
called this section the 'prince among the penal code provisions'[^63].
Disaffection was defined as want of affection in Tilak's case. In the
debate of those days, it was pointed out that this was like defining
disease as want of ease! Satyamurti wanted to reduce the rigour of the
section as interpreted by the courts. He wanted Section 124A to read:
Whoever, _with the intention of promoting physical force or violence or
public disorder_, by words either spoken or written, etc.[^64] He was
arguing that prosecution under this section should not be for the mere
use of words, but for something more than that, something akin to the
'clear and present danger' enunciated by Justice Holmes.[^65] Such a
limitation should not be the consequence of a judicial interpretation
but by means of an amendment leading to the same result right from the
start. His effort was to prevent forfeiture of liberty, not to secure
acquittal after forfeiture.

Next, Satyamurti wanted to add Subsection 3A to CrPC Section 144 of 1898.[^66] Then he deals with statutes passed between 1881 and 1932
and included in the schedule to the bill. He points out:

> Sir, there is a method in this madness. All these laws are based on a
> distrust of the judiciary, and an anxiety to punish those against whom
> the executive have got suspicions, but against whom they have got no
> evidence, and on a desire to govern this country by barbaric Russian
> methods, as they used to be called, whereby they want to suppress
> freedom of person, freedom of the press, and freedom of association,
> in order that a foreign Government may go on in its own way ... [^67]

Further, he asserts:

> All thee Acts remain on the Statute-book for fifty years, and even
> 100 years. If, after so many years of your rule, you still want these
> Acts, that shows the rotten way in which you rule the country. You had
> better leave the country at once and we shall rule it much better. You
> get out at once![^68]

He covers all these enactments and points out that not one of these acts
could exist in a civilised country. He cites the report of the committee
appointed by the British government to look into repressive laws. This
committee recommended that all these special laws should be repealed, so
that the Government of India Act, 1935, may proceed from a clean
slate.[^69] The attack was on the Prevention of Seditious Meetings
Act, 1911, and the Criminal Amendment Acts of 1908 and 1932. This
demonstrates that our law and order policy is a continuation of the
colonial policy from which we were liberated on August 15, 1947!

Satyamurti's endeavour was to democratise British rule so that the
freedom struggle was not totally obstructed by force. It could be seen
as a propaganda exercise. Even so, whatever the result of his debate,
the attempt to conceptualise sedition and public tranquillity in the
thick of the freedom struggle has some use for the democratic reordering
of our society after the attainment of freedom, since these provisions
come into operation only during periods of public unrest. Protest and
criticism of the state are very often disciplining agents and act to
pre-empt the erosion of democracy.

The study of history, a reference to the freedom struggle, the political
response to this struggle by the British, and their oppressive
administrative and legal structures could have yielded intelligible
jurisprudence for restructuring Indian institutions in terms of our own
history and in terms of the Constitution. In fact, it did not inform
interpretive exercises by the courts.

Using Gandhi's views on the rule of law, we will be in a position to
look into the progress of our attitude to law and legal theory.
Disaffection and non-cooperation, in Gandhi's view, were the duties of a
person committed to the welfare of the poor and the downtrodden. His
theory of free speech was obviously not a claim to say anything one
pleased, for he never supported violence. Rather, it was always framed
against the quality of governance and the administration of the legal
system. He claimed the right, _inter alia_, to disaffection in the context
of the Rowlatt bills, which he perceived as arbitrary and characterised
as 'lawless laws'. The political slogan that was coined by him in this
context was a well-known principle of the rule of law: 'No daleel no
appeal'.[^70]

Gandhi and the others cited earlier had no doubts about the invalidity
of the laws that governed the political activists in the country during
colonial rule. Gandhi went a step ahead of the others, however. He acted
on the firm belief that these laws need not be obeyed and that the
practice of disaffection was valid and morally justified. Gandhi's
position transcended the formulation by Dworkin while dealing with civil
disobedience in the context of the American intervention in
Vietnam.[^71] Gandhi has given in brief outline the reasons for this
disaffection. Socio-economic issues not only inform his political
decision, but also define the content and quality of free speech. It was
a charge of 'evil' governance. His stand on freedom and liberty were
fully defined when he told the judge:

> The only course open to you, the Judge, is either to resign your post,
> and thus dissociate from evil, if you feel that the law you are called
> upon to administer is an old evil and that in reality I am innocent,
> or inflict on me the severest penalty, if you believe that the system
> and law you are assisting to administer are good for the
> people.[^72]

Though the judge who tried him was confronted with a moral issue, the
legal system he served had not given him the independence to adjudicate
whether Gandhi's statement was evidence enough to fasten a conviction on
him, or whether it also had evidentiary value as a defence in
justification of sedition. The question is whether justification as
defence should be permitted at all?

This excursion into the history of the freedom struggle is necessary
because when a state of emergency was declared on 26 June 1975, the
whole country was unprepared, though there had been popular movements
before in Gujarat and Bihar, as also the expanding _Naxalite_ movement,
which had thrown a challenge to the constitutional system as interpreted
by the courts. What was also in challenge was whether the colonial
interpretation of the laws should be followed while interpreting the
Constitution? Did the Constitution imply a break with the past, at least
with reference to the people and the state and its government? Does the
transformation of a person from the status of a 'subject' to that of
'citizen' mean anything at all when interpreting the scope of entrenched
rights in the Constitution? These questions had come to the surface
after the first decade of the Constitution.

The first decade after the Constitution was spent by the Supreme Court
in defining the scope of the fundamental rights to personal liberty and
property. This period was not innovative. The interpretive techniques
adopted were colonial. In dealing with property litigation during the
first decade, eleven matters concerning agrarian reforms came before the
Supreme Court. Out of these eleven, _Kameshwar Singh_ and _Raghubir
Singh_[^73] resulted in the invalidation of some of the provisions of
the impugned acts. Property continued to be expansively defined even in
its liquid form, i.e. compensation. In _Virendra Singh_, the Supreme Court
portrayed the consequences of the Constitution coming into force very
succinctly:

> Every vestige of sovereignty was abandoned by the Dominion of India
> and by the States and surrendered to the peoples of the land who,
> through their representatives in the Constituent Assembly, hammered
> out for themselves a new Constitution in which all were citizens in a
> new order having but one tie, and owing but one allegiance: devotion,
> loyalty, fidelity to the Sovereign Democratic Republic that is India.
> At one stroke, all other territorial allegiances were wiped out and
> the past obliterated except where expressly preserved; at one moment
> of time the new order was born with its new allegiance springing from
> the same source for all, grounded on the same basis: the sovereign
> will of the peoples of India, with no class, no caste, no race, no
> creed, no distinction, no reservation.[^74]

If these were the consequences of the Constitution, then the court could
not have defined liberty and property in the way it did. But the courts
never saw the inauguration of the Constitution as a severance. They saw
the emergence of the Constitution as a continuance from where the
British left off. In fact, in _Fiddali Badruddin Mithibarwala_,[^75] the
court was at pains to point out that on the midnight of 26 January 1950,
no new institutions arose, that old institutions were continued with a
slight renaming, and that power was transferred by the colonial rulers
to the Indian representatives of the people by a proper legislation
called the Indian Independence Act. This is perhaps the only country
whose government at the commencement of its independent existence was
lawfully and not politically established.

The link between the Constitution and the people was neatly excised, and
the severance of this link led the court to think that the Constitution
was a _svayambhu_, not obliged to the people for its birth. With this
interpretation, they could easily conclude that personal liberty and the
right to life had been granted by the Constitution, so that, by the same
token, they could equally be withdrawn. With reference to the definition
of property, a mere _ipse dixit_ had the force of an imperative command,
as the right to property has always been seen as an inalienable right,
notwithstanding the grandiloquent objectives in the Preamble, which rule
out any such presumption. The objectives of economic, political and
social justice should have limited the property rights protected by the
Constitution. An unlimited right to acquire property or wealth will lead
to the enslavement of a large majority of the population, contrary to
the objectives of the Constitution. The Constitution spells out the
existence of an unequal society in India, and in that context, the
interpretation of its provisions by the court need not have led to so
many amendments to the Constitution. The crucial role that rights have
in a society like ours for bringing about social transformation, for
banishing social and economic deprivation, did not receive the primacy
of attention it ought to have. Such a role is emphasised by the presence
of a chapter called 'The Directive Principles of State Policy'.

The entire debate on personal liberty, from A.K. Gopalan onwards, has
suffered distortions. To proceed on the very untenable assumption that
Articles 19, 21 and 22 cannot be read together while construing one or
the other has devalued the democratic content of the Constitution.

In the constitutional scheme, free speech and freedom of association and
assembly are of crucial importance and are an integrated whole. In _A.K.
Gopalan_, the contention was advanced and found acceptance by one judge,
that Article 22 is a selfcontained code. The immediate consequence was
that the validity of any preventive detention law could not be assailed
on the ground that it violates the other fundamental rights contained in
that part. When a smuggler is detained preventively, his right to free
speech may not be violated; but when Comrade Gopalan was arrested, his
right to free speech, association and assembly were also simultaneously
affected. While the majority did not subscribe to the view that Article
22 was a self-contained code, this interpretation was erroneously
treated as the ruling _ratio_[^ratio] of the case.

[^ratio]: The common law term "_ratio decidendi_" is Latin for the "reason for the decision" or the rule of a case. Every decision that an appellate court makes governs the future decisions of trial courts. In other words, the lower courts must follow the rules that the appellate court states in its written decisions.

The drafting history of the Constitution tells us an entirely different
story. When Article 21 (Draft Article 15) was debated in the Constituent
Assembly, the members were not willing to approve the formulation placed
before them. In fact, they thought it was a blank cheque given to the
executive to deal with personal liberty as it pleased. One member felt
that the Assembly was being asked to draft a penal code instead of a
Constitution. It was to allay these fears that Article 22 (Draft Article
15A) was introduced. In this article, provision is made for arrest and
production before a magistrate within 24 hours and for immediate legal
advice. The rest of the article provides in fair detail the requirements
to be complied with by any law dealing with preventive detention. The
article provides detailed procedural safeguards for the citizen in the
event of his being detained under a preventive detention law. By no
stretch of the imagination can it be read as a complete code in itself,
unrelated to other freedoms. This view ruled all subsequent decisions
until the majority in the bank nationalisation case overruled it.[^76]

Our neighbour Pakistan arrived at this vacuous legality a few years
earlier. The coup staged by Mohammed Ayub Khan was questioned in the
Supreme Court of that country. The court examined the issue before
it 'in the light of the juristic principles which determine the
validity or otherwise of law creating organs of the state.' The court
examined the characters of coups and revolutions, and concluded that
the expressions were interchangeable, the form of social change and
the motive for it being irrelevant. The court then upheld the
validity of constitutional change through a coup or a revolution.
When the court was ultimately confronted with the option of choosing
between a coup and 'chaos', the court invariably ended by supporting
the coup and the existing social order. That is, the role of the
court at the time of a coup or the emergence of authoritarian rule
was ordained by its earlier role.

no order under this section shall be made by a magistrate so as to
restrict the right of any person or perons to convene, attend or
