A constitution framed after a liberation struggle or a struggle for
independence is, like poetry, emotion recollected in tranquility. It is
a severance from the past, a termination of imposed suzerainty and the
setting up of a political sovereignty of one's own people. It rests on
the proclamation of legal discontinuity, the transition of a people from
the status of subjects to that of citizens, of a nation whose
sovereignty is located in the people. This announcement of discontinuity
we find in the Declaration preceding the Preamble to the Indian
Constitution. We resolved to constitute India into a sovereign
democratic socialist republic and thereafter set out the goals which
this republic had to achieve. We moulded our struggle on liberal values
and the rule of law. We rejected imperial domination but not the
parliamentary system, which animated the politics and history of Britain
and the British people's struggles against absolute monarchy.

Our political transition did not and could never have triggered a social
revolution. Our political struggle retained with total composure the
entire colonial legal system which had been effectively used against the
freedom struggle at various stages. While we repealed Article 395, the
Indian Independence Act, 1947 and the Government of India Act, 1935,
with all the amendments that were made to the latter, we did not follow
up with the repeal of various laws which cannot operate in a sovereign
democratic socialist republic, and which have no moral and political
claim to continuance because they were statutes used against the people
and its leaders during the course of our struggle for independence, like
the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1908 and 1932 and the Prevention of
Seditious Meetings Act, 1917, to mention only the notorious ones.

It is amusing to read the origin of the three principal High Courts,
namely Madras, Bombay and Calcutta. It reads:

> Victoria, by the grace of God, of the United Kingdom and Great Britain
> and Ireland, Queen, Defender of the Faith

and proceeds to establish these courts in archaic and arcane language
and style. The other High Courts created by the Letters Patent came in
the reign of George V. The recital for setting up these High Courts
read:

> George the Fifth, by the grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great
> Britain and Ireland, and of the British Dominions beyond the sea,
> King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India ... [^9]

An understandable emotional response to such laws would be to throw them
overboard and enact a new set of laws clearly defining the powers of the
High Courts to suit the requirements of the people. No such effort was
made and the courts continued in their colonial tradition quite
unimaginatively. Fourteen years after the Constitution it was argued,
_inter alia_, before a constitution bench of the Supreme Court, that the
sovereignty of the dominion of India and of the Indian states was
surrendered to the people of India, in the exercise of which the people
gave themselves a new constitution as and from 26 January 1950.

The Supreme Court pointed out that the

> promulgation of the Constitution did not result in transfer of
> sovereignty from the Dominion of India to the Union. It was merely
> change in the form of government ... The new governmental set up was
> the final step in the process of evolution towards self-government. ...
> The continuance of the governmental machinery and of the laws of the
> Dominion, give a lie to any theory of transmission of sovereignty or
> of the extinction of the sovereignty of the Dominion, and from its
> ashes, the springing up of another sovereign ... [^10]

With unrelenting logic the court pointed out:

> There is no warrant for holding that at the stroke of midnight of 25
> January 1950, all our pre-existing political institutions ceased to
> exist, and in the next moment arose a new set of institutions
> completely unrelated to the past ... It did not seek to destroy the
> past institutions; it raised an edifice on what existed before.[^11]

The learned judges were not conscious of the cynicism involved in this
analysis. They were not critical of the Constitution. They were merely
interpreting it. And yet, however reluctantly, the court was compelled
to concede that the Constitution in fact represents the aspirations of
the people:

> The Constituent Assembly moulded itself no new sovereignty; ir merely
> gave shape to the aspirations of the people by destroying foreign
> control and evolving a completely democratic form of government as a
> republic.[^12]

Sixteen years thereafter, dealing with an issue arising under the
Letters Patent, a full bench of the Bombay High Court proceeded on the
premise that the Constitution of India is a unique document, the first
of its kind. Proceeding on this assumption, the Bombay High Court was of
the view that the Constitution 'purports to lay down an original
institutional matrix of its own,' and that 'it is not out of the
historical ramparts that something is being put up, but a fundamental
scheme,' and that in matters of the High Court's powers, therefore, there
is clear evidence that the Constitution 'made a break with the past and
had made absolutely a new, original and vital beginning ...'[^13]

When the matter came up before the Supreme Court in 1986, the apex court
unflinchingly pointed out that the assumptions made and the conclusions
reached by the full bench were wholly erroneous. Without mincing words
and setting aside patriotic or any similar emotional consideration, it
was pointed out by the apex court that the legal and constitutional
basis of our independence was the Indian Independence Act, 1947, and it
was in exercise of the power conferred by that act that the Constituent
Assembly adopted and enacted the Constitution of India. It was pointed
out that the setting up of the Constituent Assembly itself was an act of
the British Parliament.[^14]

This interpretation ignores the social history of the period preceding
the Constitution. It does not reckon with the struggles of the people
who fought for freedom, the repressive legal structures on whose altars
people were sacrificed and their dreams shattered. It ignores the
aspirations of the people to build a better society for themselves. The
rise of political democracy leading to liberation from foreign
domination is not a mere matter of evolution. There can always be a
break in the continuity, a severance from the past, without being
preceded by violence and destruction. There cannot be, there should not
be two social histories, one for political theorising and another for
legal theorising. The setting up of a Constituent Assembly and the
passing of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, are a consequence, a
culmination of the struggle for independence. It was the shared belief
of a large section of the people that there was a political severance on
August 15, 1947, and a severance constitutionally on 26 January 1950. If
this aspect is lost sight of, the court disables itself from performing
its assigned role under our Constitution.

The people who met in the Constituent Assembly were not mere technicians
who had gathered there to prepare a handbook for running the government.
They had participated in the struggles and short of holding elections,
every effort had been made to give their gathering a representative
character. The historical background leading to the formation of the
Constituent Assembly has not informed our understanding or
interpretation of the Constitution. With that understanding absent, the
institutions under the Constitution were looked upon as a continuation
of the colonial system of administration.

When the Government of India Act, 1935, was about to be brought into
force, Satyamurti, a staunch member of the Congress party from the
South, introduced a Private Members bill to repeal all repressive laws.
While debating this bill, he held the floor for three continuous days.
While debating the Constitution of independent India, not one member
proposed that all the repressive laws enacted and repeatedly used
against the people should lapse with the coming into force of the
Constitution. This task was delegated to the executive under Article
372, and the executive adopted all the laws passed by the British
without much thought. This was not a lapse. The political party that was
elected to govern genuinely felt that they were successors to the
colonial masters.

Neither the Constituent Assembly when it was in session or immediately
thereafter, nor the government set up a commission or directed the First
Law Commission to examine whar laws we required for enforcing the
Directives contained in Part IV of the Constitution and the objectives
set out in the Preamble as well. Nor was any attempt made to verify
whether the legal structure we inherited had the capacity to operate the
constitutional system we had adopted.

British rule in India was not concerned with improving the lot of the
people living here. A certain amount of stability was necessary for the
effective exploitation of the country and its resources. It is this
desire for effective control which prompted the British to make attempts
to bring about a certain degree of uniformity in the legal structure,
both civil and criminal. The Charter Act of 1833 directed the Governor
General to appoint a law commission to examine and report on the state
of the laws and the administration of justice in India. This commission
was headed by Macaulay, and it resulted in 1860 in a uniform penal code
to control all the territories under British control. Two more
commissions were appointed, in 1853 and in 1861. These led to the
passing of the Civil Procedure Code, 1859, the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1861, the Indian Succession Act, 1865, the Hindu Wills Act,
1870, the Evidence Act, 1872, the Contract Act, 1872, the Specific
Relief Act, 1877, the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, and the
Limitation Act, 1908. These were measures to regulate trade, commerce
and property transactions, and are guidelines for the administration of
justice.

These were British priorities. If they introduced us to the principles
of liberalism by piecemeal constitutional legislation, it was to gain
acceptance of their rule by the growing westerneducated middle classes,
which produced the leadership for the freedom struggle. It is evident
that a legal system structured to rule colonies can never square with a
constitutional scheme. A bureaucracy trained to man the colonial power
structure and a judiciary that was responsible for interpreting the
Government of India Acts were neither prepared nor trained to cope with
a constitution whose objectives were so different from those of the
colonial administration. With a colonial mindset dominating
administrative structures, it was impossible to compel the government to
perform its fundamental obligations. At the lower level, governing has
always meant allowing time to roll by without taking decisions. This
state of affairs is not conducive to evolving the principles of an
administration that will allow society to proceed towards the minimal
transformation provided for by the Constitution. Restructuring an
administration implies the existence of trained personnel with a
commitment to the vision essayed by the Constitution.

It does not stop there. We were unaware that around 258 British statutes
were in operation even till 1960. In 1954 in _C.G. Menon_, the Supreme
Court, while dealing with the Fugitive Offenders Act, 1881, pointed out
that the operation of this act after Independence and the Constitution
offends the sovereignty of India.[^15] The Law Commission, in its
Fifth Report, listed around 258 statutes and recommended their repeal.
It was only in 1960 that a Repealing Act was passed putting an end to
all these British statutes in operation in India.

The Law Commission also suggested replacing certain statutes. Through
the statement of objects and reasons of the Repealing Statute of 1960,
we were assured that the matter was receiving the attention of the
government. However, in the Supreme Court in 1993, in _M.V. Elisabeth_, a
matter under Admiralty Law, Justice Sahai pointed out:

> Unfortunately nothing was done. Neither the law was made up to date
> and brought in line with international covenants on maritime passed in
> 1952 etc. nor even the salient features of English law as by the
> Administration of Justice Act 1920 and 1956 were adopted and rights
> and interests of citizens of independent sovereign state continue to
> be governed by legislation enacted for colonies by the British
> Parliament. Various provisions in 1890 Act have been rendered not only
> anomalous but even derogatory to the sovereignty of the state, No
> further need be said except to express the hope that the unfortunate
> state of affairs shall be brought to an end at the earliest.[^16]

That is, the statutes were noticed only in 1994 and not earlier.

What is more amusing is that we have been carrying the colonial baggage
even with respect to our sovereign State Legislatures and Parliament.
The Constitution has created a legislature for each state and a
parliament for the country. These are sovereign bodies with powers to
legislate in the respective fields assigned to them by Schedule VII of
the Constitution. The members of these bodies are elected
representatives of the people. The Constitution provides freedom of
speech to enable them carry on their work without fear. The British
House of Commons has in the course of its history secured certain
privileges and immunities.[^17] The house claims them in its corporate
capacity and the member claims them as a representative of the people.

When the British in India set up representative institutions, the people
were never allowed such privileges against the representatives of the
British empire. The Indian Councils Act, 1861, set up a rudimentary
legislature without any privileges or immunities to the members of the
Central Legislative Council. The Governor General in Council made rules
laying down the procedure for the conduct of the Council and defined the
freedom of speech of its members. The Government of India Act, 1919,
made provisions granting immunity for anything said in either chamber of
the house or for anything contained in the report of these proceedings.
But the Governor General had the power to regulate the proceedings,
including the questions asked and the discussion of any subject
specified in the rules. The rules made by the Governor General in
Council needed the sanction of the Secretary in Council, and no
legislature had the power to repeal the rules so made.

Section 28 of the Government of India Act, 1935, makes provision for the
federal legislature to define its privileges by passing an act from time
to time. Until then they were those obtaining in Indian legislatures
immediately before the passing of the 1935 act. For breach of privilege,
no powers of imprisonment were conceded to the federal legislature,
which was not accorded the status of a court, nor was there any punitive
or disciplinary power excepting the power to remove or exclude any
person from the house. The vast powers enjoyed by the British House of
Commons were not conceded to the federal legislature, and this was
obviously a deliberate denial.

When the Indian Independence Act, 1947, came into force to make the
transition authentic and legal, the Governor General passed a few Indian
(Provisional Constitution) orders amending the Government of India Act,
1935, one of which was Subsection 2 of Section 28. It introduced the
words 'members of the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United
Kingdom' in place of the words 'members of the Indian Legislature'. This
equation made by the British ceases to be an equation when continued
after Independence. For the interpretation of Article 105 of our
Constitution, if one relies on Clause 8 of the Bill of Rights of 1688,
it only means this democratic republic of ours is still not sovereign.
In fact, Article 105(3) or 194(3), which subordinates the Parliament to
the privileges of the House of Commons, is declared to occupy the same
primacy of place as Article 19. Said the Supreme Court, 'they are as
supreme as the provisions of Part III.'[^18] What is involved here is
not the near unanimity of principles which govern all institutions
operating under the rule of law. We may even lean on the precedents of
these 'alien' institutions as reasons in the decision-making process.
But where we subjugate sovereign institutions to the decisions and
principles of an 'alien' country and allow them to regulate these
institutions, it cuts across the entire theory underlying the
Constitution and the proclamation of political sovereignty contained
therein. The slow transfer of power from time to time and in bits and
pieces has led to internalisation of procedures institutionalised during
the colonial period, which govern us as tradition even today. In
sedition prosecution we very often find ourselves citing decisions where
Bal Gangadhar Tilak was convicted!

The continuance of this is amply demonstrated by the brief submitted to
the Supreme Court in the Special Courts Bill, 1978, by the central
government under the Janata Party. The setting up of a special court for
the trial of emergency excesses and other offences was under attack. In
justification of special courts, the government relied on the Rowlatt
Acts, 1919, the Bengal Provincial (Amendment) Act, 1925, the Sholapur
Martial Law Ordinance 1930, the Bengal Criminal Law (Amendment) Acts,
1930 and 1932, the Maintenance of Public Order Act, etc. These were
special laws passed by the British to contain the independence struggle.
The court rejected them as precedents on the ground that

> these laws were Draconian in nature and were characterised by a denial
> of fair trial to those who had the misfortune to fall within the
> truncated procedure prescribed by them. They provided a summary
> procedure for the deprivation of right to life and liberty without
> affording the aggrieved person the right to carry an appeal to the
> High Court for a dispassionate examination of his contentions. Special
> courts were set up under these laws mostly to suppress the freedom
> movement in India.[^19]

What is important to note is that as subjects, the leaders of the
freedom struggle used western liberal values insurgently, but when they
assumed power they were heirs to the British and not to the freedom
fighters. The colonial tradition of governance continues today.

In the power to punish for contempt or breach of privilege, whether by
the courts or the legislature, the colonial countenance, the divine
right to subjugate is visible, and it is compounded by the oppressive
arrogance of a caste-ridden society which has a tradition of extracting
unquestioned obedience to authority. The myth about contempt powers is
that it is an emanation of royal authority. It is _sui generis_. It is
said that it always inheres in an original court of records. Of course
there is no rational explanation to justify this power. It is absolute
power unmitigated by any restraint, statutory or otherwise. It totally
negates the freedom of speech and expression. In _Bridges vs. California_,
a contempt proceeding, common law was relied upon in justification of
contempt powers.[^20] It was pointed out that to assume that English
common law in this field became theirs is to deny the generally accepted
historical belief that 'one of the objects of the Revolution was to get
rid of the English common law on liberty of speech and of the press.'

As late as 1996, the Andhra Pradesh High Court traced its ancestry to
the period of George III of Great Britain when, under the Letters Patent
dated 26 December 1818, a Supreme Court of Judicature at Madras was
established.[^21]

The courts also claim that the power of the Chief Justice of a court to
allot cases to judges and to constitute benches flows out of Section
108(2) of the Government of India Act, 1915, which was re-enacted in the
Government of India Act, 1935. We are now asked to read Section 108(2)
of the Government of India Act, 1915, into Article 225 of the
Constitution, though that article exhorts the appropriate legislature to
make laws in this regard under the provision of our Constitution. Thus,
what was transitory was allowed to continue permanently for a full fifty
years.

We entered our tryst with destiny with this colonial baggage fifty years
ago. We still carry it. Our attitude has introduced distortions in our
understanding and interpretation of the Constitution. We transferred our
sins and inadequacies to the Constitution and then put it in the dock
for its failures.
