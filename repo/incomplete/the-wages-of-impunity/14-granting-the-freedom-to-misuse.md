We began our journey as an independent country with a secular state
which stood for social, economic and political justice, informed by the
values of human dignity, equality and fraternity, decisively discarding
obnoxious religious and caste practices which sanctioned the oppression
of the vast majority of the people --- the bonded labourer, the child
worker, people who were not allowed access to wells, tanks, bathing
ghats, roads, places of public resort, people who were not allowed
access to shops, restaurants, hotels and places of public entertainment.
Ironically, access was denied in the name of the Hindu religion and the
caste system it supported, despite decades of struggle by crusading
social reformers. This chapter examines the history of debates on
secularism in India and the practice of fundamentalism today.

## Early Debates

The Constituent Assembly wanted to ensure that religion would have no
role to play in the governance of society. The right to freedom of
religion and conscience contained in the Fundamental Rights chapter
ensures equality to all religions, whether of the minorities or of the
majority. It affirms the right of the state to prohibit practices such
as denying _Dalits_ access to religious institutions and places of
Worship, attempting a restructuring of the entire social order in the
process. Political freedoms become the primary instruments for the
realisation of the objectives and value system set out in the Preamble
and the Fundamental Rights chapter of the Constitution. Our attachment
to secular values is as deep as is our attachment to personal liberty
and other related fundamental rights. The propagation of secular values
will undoubtedly propel the forces of social transformation forward. The
Congress session in Haripura in February 1938 declared that it was its

> primary duty as well as its fundamental policy to protect the
> religious, linguistic, cultural and the other rights of the minorities
> in India, so as to assure for them in any scheme of government to
> which the Congress would be a party, the widest scope for their
> development and their participation in the fullest measure in the
> political, economic and cultural life of the nation.[^130]

Gobind Ballabh Pant, moving a resolution to set up an advisory committee
on the fundamental rights of minorities and tribals in 'excluded and
partially excluded areas', stressed the importance of the issue when he
told the members of the Constituent Assembly:

> The question of minorities everywhere looms large in constitutional
> discussions. Many a constitution has foundered on this rock. A
> satisfactory solution of questions pertaining to minorities will
> ensure the health, vitality and strength of the free State of India
> that will come into existence as a result of our discussions here. The
> question of minorities cannot possibly be overrated. It has been used
> so far for creating strife, distrust and cleavage between the
> different sections of the Indian Nation. Imperialism thrives on such
> strife. It is interested in fomenting such tendencies. So far, the
> minorities have been incited and have been influenced in a manner
> which has hampered the growth of cohesion and unity. But now it is
> necessary that a new chapter should start and we should all realise
> our responsibility. Unless the minorities are fully satisfied, we
> cannot make any progress: we cannot even maintain peace in an
> undisturbed manner.[^131]

While the members of the majority community were always alive to the
Indian reality, the perception has generally been that the minorities
could be incited to misbehave, to undo the efforts of the majority to
build a cohesive society, and to thwart all possibility of maintaining
lasting peace. Ambedkar, however, never relented. In his explanatory
note he pointed out:

> To be brief, the administration in India is completely in the hands of
> the Hindus. It is their monopoly. From top to bottom it is controlled
> by them. There is no department which is not dominated by them. They
> dominate the police, the magistracy and the revenue services, indeed
> any and every branch of the administration. The next point to remember
> is that the Hindus in the administration have the same positively
> anti-social and inimical attitude to the untouchables which the Hindus
> outside the administration have. Their one aim is to discriminate
> against the untouchables and to deny and deprive them not only of the
> benefits of law but also of the protection of the law against tyranny
> and oppression. The result is that the untouchables are placed between
> the Hindu population and the Hindu-ridden administration, the one
> committing wrongs against them and the other protecting the wrongdoer
> instead of helping the victims.

He also pointed out:

> A communal majority will be free to run the administration according
> to its own ideas of what is good for the minorities.

Such a state of affairs, he pointed out, could not be called democracy.
It would have to be called imperialism.

Muslim members of the Constituent Assembly were asking for separate
electorates or for proportional representation. Mohammed Ismail Saheb
from Madras argued for a system of separate electorates. He said that,
instead of acting as a divisive device, this would bring harmony among
the people:

> The Muslims as well as the other communities want to contribute
> effectively and efficiently towards the harmony, prosperity and
> happiness of the country, which is their motherland, and for that
> purpose they want to have equal opportunities with other people. They
> want to be an honourable section of the people of the land, as
> honourable as any other section; in the days of freedom they also want
> to have freedom of expressing their views. Sir, it may be said that
> they may express their views through the representatives elected by
> all the people put together. Supposing there is a difference of
> opinion between the minority community and the majority community,
> then will the representative of the majority community represent the
> different views of the minority, Sir?[^132]

Z.H. Lahri a Muslim member from the United Provinces, proposed
proportional representation to safeguard the interests of the
minorities. Taking the case of his own province, he said the ten % of Muslims there could easily be ignored:

> The test of a system is to be made at critical times, at a time when
> passions are running high --- not when things are smooth. Therefore my
> submission is that you should coolly consider the question whether,
> apart from reservation of seats, apart from separate electorates,
> there is any democratic method which can ensure due rights to
> minorities --- be it political, social or religious.[^133]

Referring to the spirit of accommodation displayed by the house, he
pointed out:

> Only the other day, by endorsing the London decision, you accepted the
> King as the link --- a King whom you previously regarded as a symbol of
> Imperialism and oppression of our rights. ... Should you not display
> that spirit of accommodation when you are dealing with a section of
> your own, whom you have agreed you cannot but have as an integral part
> of the nation?[^134]

Vallabh _Bhai_ Patel while introducing the report of the Advisory
Committee on Minorities, etc. for the consideration of the Constituent
Assembly, prospectively overruled the issues that were later raised by
the representatives of the minorities. He said:

> It is not our intention to commit the minorities to a particular
> position in a hurry. If they really have come honestly to the
> conclusion that in the changed conditions of this country, it is in
> the interests of all to lay down real and genuine foundations of a
> secular State, then nothing is better for the minorities than to trust
> the good-sense and sense of fairness of the majority, and to place
> confidence in them. So also it is for us who happen to be in a
> majority to think about what the minorities feel, and how we in their
> position would feel if we were treated in the manner in which they are
> treated.[^135]

Ujjal Singh of Punjab, a Sikh, brought to the notice of the Constituent
Assembly the Congress resolution of December 1929 relating to Sikhs and
minorities, which read:

> No solution thereof (i.e., the communal problem) in any future
> constitution of India will be acceptable to the Congress which does
> not give full satisfaction to the Muslims, Sikhs and other
> minorities.[^136]

He pointed out that a resolution had been passed by the Sikhs to boycott
participation in the Constituent Assembly initially, but that thanks to
the efforts of Vallabh _Bhai_ Patel, the Sikh community had rescinded its
earlier decision. He informed the Assembly that the Sikhs wanted their
separate identity and position to be maintained and strengthened so that
they could contribute their full quota to the service of the country.

Hansa Mehta of Bombay pointed out how the average woman had for
centuries suffered from inequalities heaped upon her by laws, custom and
religious practices. Women had been denied ordinary human rights. Mehta
did not press for a separate electorate, reservations or quotas, but
argued for equality:

> What we have asked for is social justice, economic justice, and
> political justice. We have asked for that equality which can alone be
> the basis of mutual respect and understanding and without which real
> co-operation is not possible between man and woman. Women form one
> half of the population of this country and, therefore, men cannot go
> very far without the co-operation of women.[^137]

Jaipal Singh of Bihar, representing more than thirty million _adivasis_,
pointed out that for over six thousand years his people had been treated
disgracefully and neglected:

> The whole history of my people is one of continuous exploitation and
> dispossession by the non-aboriginals of India, punctuated by
> rebellions and disorder ...
>
> If history had to teach me anything at all, I should distrust this
> Resolution, but I do not. Now we are on a new road. Now we have simply
> got to learn to trust each other.[^138]

These extracts from the debates are illustrative of the anxieties,
doubts and fears which haunted the minorities and the response of the
leaders of the majority community. The Preamble, the Fundamental Rights
chapter, the chapter on Directive Principles, and the provisions
granting autonomy and governance free from exploitation to the tribal
areas cover the issues raised, and these form the core of the
Constitution. Most of these provisions reflected the social conditions
prevalent in the country that needed urgent and continuing attention.
Certain social evils had to be banished and unequivocally declared
unconstitutional. The attempt was to have a Constitution which would
enable the people to cope with and transform India's social reality
within a liberal framework. The concepts of social, economic and
political justice are not only objectives set down in the Preamble but
are also fundamental obligations in the governance of the country.
Further, the Constitution represents the majority's assurance to the
minorities that their claims to equality and dignity will be respected.
Implied in this claim for equality are the right to treatment as equals
and the right to equal treatment. The latter deals with the formal
aspects of equality: for example, that everyone has a right to vote,
that all have equal access to opportunities. Generally, it is an
assertion that, other things being equal, there will be no
discrimination between similarly placed persons, nor will there be a
grouping of unequal or dissimilar categories of persons while dealing
with distributive justice. The right to treatment as an equal has in it
the transformative potential necessary to realise the objectives set out
in the Preamble. Equality has been the major premise in all written
arrangements for the governance of societies. When this premise is
extended to the minorities, it means not only one person, one value; it
also includes the rights of the minorities as collectives to maintain
their identity in dignity. It extends to them a sense of participation
in the management of the affairs of society by integrating them as
equals in reality, not merely in form.

The draft Directives contained two articles which deal with women and
communal discord. Draft Article 42 reads:

> The state shall endeavour to secure that marriage shall be based only
> on the mutual consent of both sexes and shall be maintained through
> mutual co-operation, with the equal rights of husband and wife as a
> basis. The State shall also recognise that motherhood has a special
> claim upon its care and protection[^139]

This article was dropped without any debate for reasons that are quite
obvious. Draft Article 45 reads:

> The state shall promote internal peace and security by the elimination
> of every cause of communal discord.[^140]

This article too was dropped without any debate, although its retention
would have compelled the state to take effective steps to prevent the
continuation and growth of communal organisations and politics.

While the first clause in Article 15 declares equal treatment for all,
Subclauses (a) and (b) reflect the existing social practices that had to
be banished. While these provisions should normally aid our
understanding of equality while interpreting Clause 1 of Article 15, the
courts have been blind to this possibility, leading to an avoidable
amendment of the Constitution. Clause 2 of Article 15 reads:

> No citizen can, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place
> of birth or any of them, be subject to any disability, liability,
> restriction or condition with regard to :---
>
> (a) access to shops, public restaurants, hotels, and places of
> public entertainment; or
>
> (b) the use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads, and places of
> public resort maintained wholly or partly out of state funds or
> dedicated to the use of the general public.

Clearly, this clause only refers to the obnoxious practices of the Hindu
caste system. Reservations in educational institutions and in government
services are another aspect of the principle of equality.

Article 17 abolishes untouchability, and the practice of it in any form
is declared a punishable offence. Articles 23 and 24 prohibit bonded
labour and child labour, and the practice of the former is declared an
offence. Articles 25 to 30 deal with the rights of minorities with
reference to their religion, language and culture. Freedom of religion
is guaranteed, subject to public order, morality and health. All are
equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right to freely
profess, practise and propagate religion (Article 25). No person can be
compelled to pay taxes for the promotion or maintenance of any
particular religious denomination (Article 27). Article 28 embodies the
principle that state funds may not be used to promote religion; that no
religious instruction shall be offered by any institution wholly
maintained by the state; no pupil shall be compelled to receive any
religious instruction in any institution which is either recognised by
or gets aid from the state. Article 30 guarantees to the minorities the
right to establish and administer their own educational institutions;
the amount fixed for acquiring the properties of these institutions
should not restrict or abrogate the right guaranteed. Articles 330 to
337 provide for reservation of seats to Scheduled Castes and Tribes and
the Anglo--Indian community in Parliament and the State Legislatures.
Article 338 provides for the appointment of a special officer for the
Scheduled Castes and Tribes who will investigate the working of the
safeguards provided to them and submit his report to the President.
Articles 339 and 340 make it his responsibility to supervise the
scheduled areas and determine whether the administration and governance
there are in accordance with constitutional objectives. The President
should satisfy himself regarding the progress made by the backward
classes. Towards this end he is authorised to appoint commissions to
assist him in appraising the progress made by the tribals and other
deprived classes. The chapter Directive Principles of State Policy
contains a minimum programme which no government, whatever its politics,
can ignore. These directives have been described as pious homilies. For
the lawyers gathered there, what was not litigable was not useful. For
Ambedkar, however, the directives had their insurgent use. He pointed
out:

> But whoever captures power will not be free to do what he likes with
> it. In the exercise of it, he will have to respect these Instruments
> or Instructions which are called Directive Principles. He cannot
> ignore them. He may not have to answer for their breach in a court of
> law. But he will certainly have to answer for them before the
> electorate at election time. _What great value these directive
> principles possess will be realised better when the forces of the
> right contrive to capture power._[^141]

We are in the thick of such a venture. In fact, an election is defined
in the Representation of the People Act, 1951, to mean filling the seats
in the houses of Parliament or those of the Legislatures, not as a
process by which citizens choose their representatives to participate in
the management of the affairs of the society. Filling seats, we have
realised in recent times, no longer requires the participation of the
people.

Between 1969 and 1975, political justice and political freedoms were
under assault, resulting in the notorious declaration of a state of
emergency in June 1975. Along the way, the principles of governance set
out in Part IV were abandoned and the desirability of social
transformation separated from political freedoms and political justice,
the latter increasingly viewed as an inconvenience and an obstacle to
governance itself. That arbitrariness and opacity are indispensable for
governance has since become received wisdom in the entire institutional
apparatus of the state.

The next three decades witnessed systematic assaults on the very secular
structure of our society by theocratic politics in consistent opposition
to agendas of social transformation --- from the Rath Yatra and the
demolition of the Babri Masjid on 6 December 1992 to the overthrow of
the V.P. Singh government for daring to uphold two core principles of
the Constitution: secularism and reservation. This was also a period
when political parties based their strategies on the religion of the
majority, spelling disaster to the political system structured by the
Constitution. The laws governing our electoral processes are not
equipped to prevent the entry or contending for power of antisecular
parties into Parliament or the Legislatures. This has led to an
entrenchment of such politics within Parliament, the fall of the V.P.
Singh government being a direct result. While Ambedkar was not shrewd
enough to anticipate the way the upper castes would deal with his
document, the provisions outlined above should still enable us to define
secularism in our fight against religious fundamentalism and fascist
trends.

## The Uniform Civil Code

A judge sometimes has to play the role of a legislator. His independence
is assured to him so that he may look at issues arising before him in an
objective manner and ensure that the process of arriving at a decision
is fair. Implied is an obligation to deal equally with all the minority
communities. The judiciary can initiate changes in society without
violent blows to custom or tradition. This is particularly true in cases
where minorities live under threat and assert their identity through
absolute adherence to personal laws. For example, we have the issue of a
uniform civil code as opposed to Muslim men's right to divorce orally.
The Tilhari judgment immediately comes to mind.

Although the issue of divorce was not directly before the judge at all
in this case, the question being one of land, he declared the divorce
invalid and the woman's entitlement to the land was lost, since it was
declared surplus.[^142] At the time that Shah Bano brought her case
before the court, the stand of the government on the question of Muslim
personal law was this:

> We would not like to interfere with the customary law of Muslims
> through the Criminal Procedure Code. If there is a demand for change
> in the Muslim personal law, it should actually come from the Muslim
> community itself and we should wait for the Muslim public opinion on
> these matters to crystallise before we try to change this customary
> right or make changes in their personal law.[^143]

Arguing that injustice must stop, and that the courts must take the
initiative in the absence of other concerted efforts, the judge assumed
the role of reformer and went ahead with his interpretation of the
Koran, without explaining what he meant by a 'uniform civil code'. Is
the reference to similar but different statutes operating in the field
now covered by the personal laws of the respective minorities? Or is it
a common civil code where all the communities will forgo their religious
and ethnic identities and be governed by one statute that replaces all
their personal laws? Is this going to be achieved by a democratic
process of working out a consensus? Is it going to be statutorily
imposed? Or is it going to be judicially declared?

Judge Tilhari, like many Hindus, feels that Muslims are backward and
need to be reformed, forgetting that changes in the Hindu community were
brought about by social reform movements led by Hindus. To get a proper
perspective on issues like these, we must examine the codification of
Hindu laws, the resultant laws and their secular character, and the
judicial policy and its breach.

The Hindu Widow Remarriage Act, 1856, removed the barriers that
prevented widows from marrying again. The Hindu Inheritance (Removal of
Disabilities) Act, 1928, was passed to remove the obstacles to
inheritance based on disease, deformity or certain types of mental or
physical defects. The Women's Right to Property Act, 1937, improved to
some extent the position of Hindu women in the matter of succession. All
these legislative interventions were made after deliberation with and
within the Hindu community. By 1941, several amendments to women's right
to property were pending consideration. The government of India, by a
resolution dated January 25, 1941, appointed a committee consisting of
B.N. Rau as chairman and Dwarkanath Miter, J.R. Gharpure and Rajaratna
Vasudeo Vinayak Joshi as members to examine the various bills seeking to
amend the Hindu Women's Right to Property Act and to suggest such
amendments as would resolve doubts and remove any injustice that may
have been done by this 1937 act to daughters. They were also to examine
and advise on the amendment to the Hindu Law of Inheritance, a bill
promoted by K. Santhanam, and the Hindu Women's Rights to Separate
Residence and Maintenance Bill, introduced by G.V. Deshmukh. All these
amendments had been introduced by Hindu members of the central
legislature.

The Rau Committee held that the various Hindu customs and practices
needed study, and that an attempt should be made to codify Hindu law.
The two draft bills on inheritance and marriage were however introduced
and they were referred to another committee, which suggested that the
Rau Committee should be resuscitated and encouraged to complete the task
of bringing about a comprehensive Hindu code as suggested by it.
Accordingly, by a resolution dated January 20, 1944, the Hindu Law
Committee was revived, with T.R. Venkatrama Sastri in the place of R.V.
Joshi, this being the only change.

This committee set about its work in right earnest and published a draft
code with an explanatory note on August 5, 1944. The explanatory
statement said:

> One of the objects of the Committee is to evolve a Uniform Civil Code
> of Hindu Law which will apply to all Hindus by blending the most
> progressive elements in the various schools of law which prevail in
> the different parts of the country. The achievement of uniformity
> necessarily involves the adoption of one view in preference to others
> on particular matters. The Committee's desire is that the code should
> be regarded as an integral whole, and that no part should be judged as
> if it stood by itself.

The Hindu Law Committee then travelled all over the country, meeting
with a cross-section of the people and recording their views. The final
draft of its report was ready by February 1947, and it was introduced as
a bill in the Constituent Assembly (Legislative), which in turn referred
it to a select committee in 1948.

This committee was chaired by B.R. Ambedkar, the law minister. The other
members were K.Y. Bhandarkar and G.R. Rajagopal of the ministry of law
and S.V. Gupte of the Bombay bar. This select committee revised the bill
without making substantial changes. However, before it could come up in
the Constituent Assembly (Legislative), the publicity it had received
gave rise to a controversy, with a cry of religion in danger. Ambedkar
immediately convened a conference in 1950 to which he invited scholars,
well-read persons and pundits from Benares and other places to canvass
support for the steps initiated towards codifying Hindu law. He held
another conference at Trivandrum to consider whether the Marumakathayam
and Aliyasanthana laws could be made part of the proposed Hindu code.
Despite all these efforts, the draft code met with rough weather when it
came up for consideration in the Assembly on February 5, 1951. Its
passage was blocked by amendments galore. The debate, which was
inconclusive, was taken up again in September 1951, but the differences
could not be resolved. With the coming of the regular parliament after
the elections of 1952, the Hindu Code Bill lapsed. It was followed by
four piecemeal legislations codifying certain areas of Hindu law.

Under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1956, conversion from the Hindu religion
immediately provides a ground for divorce for the other spouse. The
question of reconciliation during the pendency of proceedings as a step
to avert divorce is of no avail; neither is judicial separation as an
interim measure to enable couples to rethink their stand and come back
together. No doubt a difference in religion creates incompatibility, but
such a statutory provision encouraging divorce is both anti-secular and
in derogation of Article 25. Under the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance
Act, one must be a Hindu to be able to adopt and the adoptee should also
be a Hindu. Thus the principle that persons belonging to two religions
can live together is not even tolerated. Under the Hindu Minority and
Guardianship Act, ceasing to be a Hindu deprives either spouse from
claiming guardianship over their children. The Law of succession does
not deprive a convert the right of succession, but his or her children
and descendants are denied the right to succeed to the property of a
Hindu relative unless they are Hindu when succession opens. Equal
property rights for women were opposed on the ground that Hindu women
always get a substantial share in the family property in the shape of
jewellery and as dowry at the time of marriage. Also, giving a woman
property rights would lead to the introduction of a stranger into the
family, the son-in-law. This was considered very undesirable as it could
lead to friction between brother and sister and to fragmentation of the
estate. Finally, since a woman's affections get transferred to her
husband's family, it was not desirable to give her a share in her
father's property.

This experience ought to have informed us that the formulation of a
uniform civil code cannot be a mere majoritarian legislative exercise.

## Community Rights in Independent India

The courts have not till now struck down any provision or rule, either
enacted or otherwise, in any personal law. In the first few years of the
Constitution, enactments prohibiting bigamy were challenged in some
state high courts. One such case came up in the Bombay High Court when
Chagla was the Chief Justice. The Bombay Prevention of Hindu Bigamous
Marriages Act, 1946, was under challenge. The argument was that a son is
an absolute necessity if a Hindu is to attain spiritual salvation and
that therefore a Hindu becomes polygamous in pursuit of a son and not
for any other reason. Another argument was that only the Hindu community
had been targeted by this act, while the Muslims had been left free to
practise polygamy.

Chagla embarked on the discussion by saying, 'It is only with a
considerable amount of hesitation that I would like to speak about the
Hindu religion.' On the issue of discrimination, Chagla held:

> The institution of marriage is differently looked upon by the Hindus
> and the Muslims. Whereas to the former it is a sacrament, to the
> latter it is a matter of contract. That is also the reason why the
> question of dissolution of marriage is differently tackled. While
> Muslim law admits of easy divorce, Hindu marriage is considered
> indissoluble and it is only recently that the state passed legislation
> permitting divorce among Hindus. The state was also entitled to
> consider the educational development of the two communities. One
> community might be prepared to accept and work for social reform,
> another may not be yet prepared for it; and Article 14 does not lay
> down that any legislation that the state may embark upon must be of an
> all-embracing character. The state may bring about legislation by
> stages, and the stages may be territorial or they may be
> community-wise.[^144]

Gajendragadkar, who was later to be the Chief Justice of India, more or
less reiterated this view. Both held that personal laws do not come
within the meaning of 'laws in force' under Article 13(1) of the
Constitution.

Towards the end of 1979, the Supreme Court had before it the question
whether the High Court had been right in holding that

> the strict rule enjoined by the Smriti writers, as a result of which
> sudras were considered to be incapable of entering the order of 'yati'
> or 'sanyasi', has ceased to be valid because of the Fundamental Rights
> guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution.[^145]

The Supreme Court overruled this judgement, arguing that the High Court
had failed to appreciate that Part III of the Constitution does not
touch upon the personal laws of the parties. The Supreme Court held that
laws derived from recognised and authoritative sources of Hindu
principles such as the _Smritis_ and other commentaries, must be enforced
except where such principles have been altered by usage or custom, or
modified or abrogated by statute. The court held that judges could not
introduce modern concepts into religious law; that Hindu scriptures and
religious texts have never been subject to judicial review.

In the Shah Bano case, however, the court interpreted the Koran at a
time when the minority community was under threat, prompting the
government to take the stand that customary Muslim law cannot be
interfered with through the Criminal Procedure Code, and that it was
necessary to wait till Muslim public opinion on such matters changed
before attempting to change their personal laws.[^146] And yet,
donning the reformer's garb with reference to Muslims, Justice Tilhari
pitted the Code of Criminal Procedure against the Koran:

> A beginning has to be made if the Constitution is to have any meaning.
> Inevitably, the role of the reformer has to be assumed by the courts,
> because it is beyond the endurance of sensitive minds to allow
> injustice to be suffered when it is so palpable.

So saying, he struck down the Shariat Act of 1937 and also oral
divorce,[^147] In the present climate, a few more judgments like Judge
Tilhari's may lead to situations that could well become irretrievable.
Some may welcome such decisions on the ground that they are, after all,
just. However, as Cardozo puts it so well. 'That might result in
benevolent despotism if the judges were benevolent men. It would put an
end to the reign of law.'[^148]

This was the first time after the failure of the politics and
jurisprudence of social justice that we witnessed the orchestration of
the Hindu world view through the superimposition of the majority
religion on the constitutional value system.

## Secularism and the Judiciary

> Judges are apt to be naïve, simple-minded men, who need to learn to
> transcend (their) own convictions. (Oliver Wendell Holmes)

Religious practices --- minority and majority --- reinforce the _status quo_.
Any criticism of religious bigotry is inevitably countered by shifting
the focus from the religion's obscurantist practices which fuel
fundamentalist politics to its metaphysical, philosophical foundations.
This enables a vicarious entry of religion into politics.

Fortunately, however, there are some positive exceptions to this trend.
The demolition of the Babri Masjid and the subsequent violence led to
considerable judicial introspection. The result was a redefinition of
secularism and its role in the political processes of the country in
_S.R. Bommai._[^149] Seven of the nine judges on the Constitution Bench
elaborated on the principles of secularism which should guide the court
in adjudicating Sections 123(3) and 123(3a) of the Representation of the
People Act, 1951. There was no dissent.[^150] The majority held that
secularism was a basic feature of the Constitution and any step
inconsistent with this was unconstitutional; that the encroachment of
religion into the secular activities of the state was to be strictly
prohibited; that secularism was part of the fundamental law and that the
Indian political system must fulfil the socio-economic needs essential
for material and moral prosperity and political justice for all
citizens. To describe secularism as a vacuous or phantom concept, the
court held, was absolutely erroneous. Linking secularism to the
electoral process, the majority held that no government could promote
any particular religion as the state religion and therefore all
political parties were enjoined to maintain neutrality of religious
beliefs and prohibit practices derogatory to the Constitution and the
laws; the introduction of religion into politics was expressly
prohibited both by the Constitution and by the Representation of the
People Act, 1951. Political parties, groups of persons or individuals
who sought to influence the electoral process with a view to coming to
power should abide by the Constitution and the laws, including
secularism. Section 123(3) could not be circumvented by resort to
technical arguments as to its interpretation.[^151] The court pointed
out that no party or organisation could be simultaneously religious and
political. At the time of registration for allotment of an electoral
symbol, every party must file a declaration affirming its faith in the
principles of 'socialism, secularism and democracy'.

The judiciary, in this decision, for the first time declared that
secularism is an indispensable premise which should inform not only
governance but all the other institutions of society. This was a
declaration that ought to have become the guiding principle for all
future interpretive endeavours by the courts. Unfortunately, this was
not to be. For example, in _Manohar Joshi_ and other cases,[^152] the
High Court formulated the proposition correctly in line with the
pronouncements of the Supreme Court in _Kihota Hollohan_ and _S.R.
Bommai_,[^153] saying:

> It must be noted that this election petition is not based on
> individual acts of respondent or his election agent or any other
> person with his consent. This petition is based upon the above
> mentioned plank and/or policy decision of the Shiv Sena and the BJP
> and the campaigning by the party and respondent on the basis of
> plank.[^154]

But then, Justice Verma of the Supreme Court faulted the High Court
judge, pointing out that the requisite consent of the candidate cannot
be assumed merely from the fact that he belonged to the same political
party of which the wrongdoer was a leader, since there can be no
presumption in law that there is consent of every candidate of the
political party for every act done by every acknowledged leader of that
party. Clearly, this view is totally divergent from the views of the
Supreme Court on the party system, secularism and the limitations
imposed by their decisions on the role of religion in political
processes.

The impact of this decision is even starker when we examine excerpts
from the election speeches of Bal Thackeray during the Shiv Sena's
campaign, as quoted by the petitioner in this case:

> We are fighting this election for the protection of Hinduism.
> Therefore we do not care for the votes of the Muslims. This country
> belongs to Hindus and will remain so.
>
> Hinduism will triumph in this election and we must become the
> honourable recipients of this victory to ward off the danger to
> Hinduism ... You will find Hindu temples underneath if all the mosques
> are dug out. Anybody who stands against the Hindus should be
> sho(w)ered or worshipped with shoes.
>
> We have come with the ideology of Hinduism. Shiv Sena will implement
> this ideology. Though this country belongs to Hindus, Rama and Krishna
> are insulted.
>
> The result of these elections will not depend on the solution to the
> problem of food, cloth, but the same will decide whether in the State
> the flame of _Hindutva_ will grow or will be extinguished. If in
> Maharashtra the flame of Hinduism is extinguished, then _anti-national_
> Muslims will be powerful and they will convert Hindustan into
> Pakistan. In the flame of _Hindutva_ ... the _anti-national_ Muslims will be
> reduced to ashes.
>
> Rajiv Gandhi speaking on _Hindutva_ is like a prostitute lecturing on
> fidelity ... His wife is a Christian, mother Hindu, father a Parsi and
> therefore himself without any (Hindu) culture/teaching.[^155]

Although there is a conflation of Hinduism with _Hindutva_, with parties
and judges taking convenient recourse to Hinduism in the abstract as the
carrier of true meaning, the extracts given by the election petitioner
leave no one in doubt that Bal Thackeray and his colleagues were not
expounding Hindu philosophy in its transcendental dimension. The
passages put on record clearly demonstrate that what was being expounded
was vulgar Hindu nationalism and an anti-minority diatribe. Yet the
judgment canonised Bal Thackeray as a Hindu saint; naming him for
corrupt practices did not alter the character of the judgment. True, the
consequence was unintended, but nonetheless it is a consequence we will
have to live with and suffer for.

## Bal Thackeray and the Law

Public demand for a proper enquiry into the communal carnage in Mumbai
resulted in the setting up of the _Srikrishna Commission_.[^156] Bal
Thackeray was among those indicted, and the ruling Democratic Front
decided to go ahead with the prosecution.

However, indicting Bal Thackeray spells trouble. The state government
asked for a three thousand-strong police force from the centre, a demand
the latter pleaded unable to meet. Instead, signals went out from all
sides that the state would be held to ransom and that the NDA government
at the centre would collapse if the Shiv Sena withdrew its support.

For people to continue their faith in political processes and in the
Constitution, governance cannot merely be a circus of balancing the
political forces operating the system. It is time to pause and reflect
on our colonial legacy that distances governance from the people and
their aspirations. The abuse of electoral processes almost to the
breaking point, both by individuals (tyranny) and by groups (gangster
'democracy'), is now commonplace. In such a system one would be hesitant
to prosecute a crime when the offender is a political colleague or ally.
Let us not forget that the carnage led by Bal Thackeray was the
aftermath of the Rath Yatra and Ayodhya. The crimes for which these
persons stood indicted were not just crimes as defined by the Indian
Penal Code. Attacking a targeted group, whether religious or political,
cannot be equated to individual crimes. A group plans and attacks a
targeted community at various places and in different localities. The
simultaneity of these occurrences convinces us that these are not
unconnected offences committed by offenders unconnected to each other.
Macaulay's penal code describes these offences inadequately, and is
therefore totally ineffective. Subsequent amendments did not anticipate
the chilling precision with which such crimes would be planned and
executed. These collective crimes have led to the total collapse of the
system and all its institutions.

A new amendment or the enactment of a new penal code is not always
necessary. What is needed is a redefinition of existing provisions,
bringing them in line with recent trends in criminality. Offences seldom
change, only the manner in which they are committed changes. And while
this may have relevance for the imposition of punishment, it does not
make the offence new. Take the definition of terrorism, for instance.
Before a communal riot takes place, reports of stray violent incidents
overawes a vast section of the people, bringing them within the
definition of a terrorist act. But when entire communities live in
terror, this state of fear is often intended, not merely a consequence.
The legal definition is partisan. Knives and kerosene are not terrorist
weapons; the Rath Yatra which inflamed communal passions became a major
factor in the country's politics, but these did not entail the permanent
introduction of anti-terrorist laws. Meanwhile, the Law Commission views
the Coimbatore bomb blasts as a signal of the growth of terrorism.

A secular approach is indispensable to the formulation of penal law, for
it is always penal law and the criminal justice process that serves as
an index of the nature and character of our polity. A careful
examination of existing law by the Law Commission might have pointed to
the possibility of enhancing punishments provided for by Sections 153A
and 153B of the Penal Code, since they contain the rudiments of
'genocide' as defined by the Genocide Convention, and can be read as
applicable to crimes that come under the definition of genocide.[^157]

The Srikrishna Commission found that while the immediate cause for the
communal riots --- a spontaneous outburst --- was the destruction of the
Babri Masjid, the riots that then took place from 18 January 1993 were
organised by the Shiv Sena and incited by the speeches of its leaders
and their writings in communal newspapers like _Samna_ and _Navakal_. The
commission named Bal Thackeray, Sirpordar and Manohar Joshi. Yet we look
at the findings of the commission as unimportant, and hold that the
crimes committed by the persons indicted are time-barred --- crimes that
left a thousand people dead, a thousand injured, another thousand
homeless, and destroyed property worth four thousand crore rupees. It is
a strange interpretation of human rights to say the indictment is
time-barred when the riots that took place were a systematic,
pre-planned and concerted attack on specific groups of people and a
challenge to the system as a whole. There has never been a limitation
for initiating a prosecution for capital crimes, or for crimes against a
targeted group, racial, religious, ethnic or otherwise. The punishment
provided under the law may not be deterrent, but the prosecution of
persons like Bal Thackeray, who have always believed that they are above
the law and are armed with tremendous proclivities to unleash disorder,
would certainly have a deterrent effect.

## Mandal--Masjid--Mandir: 6 December 1992

The destruction of the Babri Masjid, the construction of a Ram temple in
Ayodhya and the Mandal Commission's report raise yet again the issue of
equality. Was the opposition to reservations and the insistence in
erecting a _mandir_ in place of a _masjid_ at Ayodhya constitutional?

By undertaking the Rath Yatra, by repeated declarations of the intention
to rebuild a temple at the location of the mosque, and by linking these
with an assertion that secularism has only meant appeasing the
minorities, the latter, who number 110 million, are informed that this
country is no longer their home and that their continued stay in it can
never be on the basis of the guarantees extended to them by the
Constitution. This is the stand taken by a political party whose elected
members have sworn to uphold the Constitution. It is in this context
that the destruction of that 'dilapidated structure' assumes importance.
It symbolises the right to survival of the Muslim minority in
particular, and other minorities in general.

The destruction of the Babri Masjid marked the beginning of a very ugly
trend in Indian politics. The assumption by the Hindu majority of the
role of conquerors setting out to redress the wrongs of the past,
starting with those of Mahmud Ghazni, negated with one stroke everything
we had fought for in the making of the nation. Toynbee's words of
caution are particularly relevant

> _We must be on our guard against 'historical sentiment'_, that is
> arguments taken from conditions which once existed or were supposed to
> exist, but which are no longer real at the present moment. They are
> most easily illustrated by extreme examples. Italian newspapers have
> described the annexation of Tripoli as recovering the soil of the
> fatherland because once it was a province of the Roman Empire; and the
> entire region of Macedonia is claimed by Greek chauvinists on the one
> hand, because it contains the site of Pella, the cradle of Alexander
> the Great in the fourth century B.C, and Bulgarians on the other,
> because Ochrida, in the opposite corner, was the capital of the
> Bulgarian Tzardom in the tenth century AD, though the drift of time
> has buried the tradition of the latter almost as deep as the
> achievements of the Emathian Conqueror on which the modern Greek
> nationalists insist so strongly.[^158]

The decision of the V.P. Singh government to enforce the Mandal
Commission recommendations and to oppose the fundamentalist approach to
the Ayodhya issue were attempts at ensuring the continuance of
secularism in a society that is being rent asunder by religious
fundamentalism. V.P. Singh's motive was obviously to gain political
mileage in an adversarial system where competition for votes has become
the centrepiece of our definition of democracy, but the merit of his
stand cannot therefore be dismissed. Of course, the same adversarial
system made a reversal possible by overthrowing his government. Thus,
both Ram and secularism are mere pawns in a political game, with the
citizens as passive spectators.

The popular image of the BJP, RSS, VHP and such other related outfits
internalised by the middle classes is that they comprise dedicated,
disciplined and law-abiding members who are not votaries of violence and
abjure from the practice of skullduggery and deceit. In the second phase
of the Ayodhya issue, Narasimha Rao, a pious Hindu who worships both
gods and godmen, could not reject this image, particularly when it was
linked with Ram. He could fight the BJP but he could not fight Ram, he
declared.[^159] Predictably therefore, he decided to appease the
majority sentiment with the object of appropriating the Hindu vote in
the event of a mid-term poll. Thus we saw him following the terms laid
down by an assortment of saffron-clad sadhus, and declaring his trust in
L.K. Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi, making a mockery of the largest
democracy in the world. When at the penultimate stage the matter came
before the court, the latter failed to take account of the political
context in which the Rath Yatra had taken place, especially its
aftermath of widespread communal violence. Thus, it threw away a chance
to prevent the carnage and massacre that followed the demolition of the
Babri Masjid.

## Democracy and the Electoral System

While we opted for parliamentary democracy, the party system as such is
not referred to anywhere in the Constitution. Nor is there any mention
of it anywhere in the Representation of the People Act, 1951. Sections 3
and 3(1A) of this act bar appeals to one's religion, race, caste,
community or language and prohibits the promotion of enmity or hatred
between different classes. Even an attempt to do so is declared corrupt
practice. However, these injunctions are against the individual and not
against a party formed on the basis of religion, caste or community, or
which has for its agenda the promotion of hatred based on religion,
caste, community, etc.

A political party formed for anti-secular purposes has free play in the
political arena. A member of such a party who contests elections is
viewed by the above provisions as an individual, and is seldom held
accountable for his party's conduct. Thus, a party's large-scale corrupt
practices and anti-secular propaganda go largely unchecked. This is only
compounded by the fact that our political parties have never sought to
improve the electoral process; they have no faith in democracy or in
abiding by the law, practising instead an adherence to mere form. The
judiciary, although set up with the primary objective of enforcing
accountability and preserving the democratic values enshrined in the
Constitution, has been halting in implementing its assigned role, acting
at crucial moments against a citizen's right to liberty and ambivalent
when secular values are under threat.

This prevarication is consistently visible in the decisions rendered in
election disputes. The court treats an election trial as quasi-criminal,
and an elected candidate is likened to an accused. These two premises
give room for enormous legal sophistry. In fact, the benefits of
interpretation and lack of conclusive evidence that rarely accrue to an
ordinary citizen accused of a criminal offence, are easily available to
a candidate whose election has been challenged. In the former case,
almost every lapse of the prosecution is condoned by the court unless
prejudice is shown to have occurred, while a varied assortment of
technical pleas and defective pleadings, apart from the court's own
definition of crucial words like 'consent', let candidates off the hook
in cases where an election has been challenged. Both these trends are
undemocratic. It is theoretically unsound to equate an accused person to
an elected candidate, and derogatory of the rights of the accused to a
fair trial when his defences are watered down on the one hand, while
extending to the elected person privileges which are denied to the
accused.[^160]

Democracy, though a basic structure of the Constitution, was never
reckoned as the ultimate determinant of either the validity of penal
laws or of the laws and rules governing election trials. Parliament's
indifference to the degeneration of the electoral process, the court's
refusal to take notice of this degeneration, and the consequent failure
to review and update the principles laid down while interpreting
electoral laws has resulted in elections getting distanced from
representation; the elected do not represent either the people or the
constitutional value system.

While the debate on the Tenth Schedule centred on the conduct of the
elected representatives of a political party inside Parliament, the
entire party system was (had to be) discussed. A political party, the
court reiterated, functions on the strength of its shared beliefs, and
neither the party system nor parliamentary democracy contemplates
concerted action by the members to speak against declared party policy.
As the court reiterated, quoting Griffith and Ryles:

> Loyalty to party is the norm, being based on shared beliefs. A divided
> party is looked upon with suspicion by the electorate. It is natural
> for members to accept the opinion of their leaders and spokesmen on a
> wide variety of matters on which those members have no specialist
> knowledge. Generally, members will accept the majority decisions even
> when they disagree.[^161]

Loyalty to the party in the context of a party system is a necessity,
even a compulsion, for the party to be functionally relevant and stable.
But if the shared beliefs contain theocratic ambitions or aspirations,
as in the case of _Manohar Joshi_, they must be declared corrupt
practices, since such political activities have the potential of
undermining the Constitution from within. Constitutional limitations do
not operate on the state alone; they operate even against political
parties. But the latter limitations generally manifest themselves
through statutory provisions, mainly penal. When it comes to election
law, despite the fact that elected members become the chosen
representatives who will implement the Constitution, the key provisions
are never interpreted in consonance with the Constitution.

## Conclusion

The common thread running through apparently disconnected issues is the
rise of religion as a political force. In an adversarial political
system operating in a plural society, this process cannot but be
violent, the attempt always being to subjugate minority communities.
When translated into law, this kind of violence becomes the crime of
genocide. We have recently witnessed a carnage in Gujarat that was worse
than the slaughter of Sikhs in the aftermath of Indira Gandhi's
assassination. Neither the killings of Sikhs in Delhi and other places
nor the Mumbai riots of 1992--93 have taught our governments any
lessons. The fact that such large-scale violence can take place in the
country with impunity, with all the institutions of the state totally
paralysed into inaction, shows the extent of anomie that has come to
characterise governance in India today. Ralph Dahrendorf describes the
scenes of disorder after rumours spread of the Führer's death towards
the end of April 1945. Shopkeepers fled out of fright; people helped
themselves to what was available in the shops; in the bookshops, people
took books home and Dahrendorf himself took some. From these incidents
he delves into the concept of anomie, which according to him is not a
State of mind but a state of society where restrictions get
progressively weakened and impunity becomes the order of the day. Those
in charge withhold punishments, and individuals and groups are exempted
from conformity to law. Dahrendorf paraphrases Lambarde's description of
anomia:

> Anomia 'brings disorder, doubt and uncertainty over all.' People can
> no longer predict whether their neighbour is going to kill them or
> give them his horse. Norms no longer seem to exist, or if they are
> invoked they turn out to be toothless. All sanctions seem to have
> withered away. This in turn refers to the disappearance of power or,
> more technically, a re-transformation of legitimate authority into
> crude and arbitrary power. This is hardly a state in which anyone
> would wish to live.[^162]

This is precisely the position we are in now. The uncritical acceptance
of the vulgar play of power politics as valid exercises in democracy has
led to the complete degeneration of our democracy. In this vulgarised
state of affairs the concept of _Hindutva_[^163] has been thrown in with
a promise of cleansing politics. The breach with the Constitution is now
complete. Thus, an untested new trend has been introduced, resulting in
a breakdown in culture at a time when there was an acute disjunction
between cultural norms and secular goals. The violence today has
official sanction from within the government --- from incumbents in
elected positions to the members of the administrative and police
bureaucracy. This sanction dispenses with the need to rely on the
metamorality of religion to justify the violence. The country was on the
road to anomie right from 1968, and almost all our institutions had been
destroyed by the 1980s. The destruction of the Babri Masjid signalled
the demise of secularism and the rise of Hindu nationalism for the
second time, this time demonstrating its genocidal inclination.

With what happened in Gujarat is everything irretrievably lost?
Secularism is an alien word; as a concept it has no Indian equivalent.
But the same is true of the Westminster model followed by our democracy,
as also the concepts of contempt of court and independence of the
judiciary. Yet we have internalised the latter two and not secularism.
There were advantages in this, for it helped in the unprincipled
manipulation of power with a view to maintaining a caste-oriented,
low-profile Hindu state. There is now an urgent need to redefine
secularism and delimit the role of religion in temporal areas.
Secularism has to be understood as inter-religious understanding, where
equality and human dignity should inform all religious practices within
each religion and between religions. The problem is that neither
Parliament nor the courts try to understand the ideas of secularism in
terms of the Constitution, and hence there is no uniform exposition of
these expressions. While the Supreme Court equated Hinduism to _Hindutva_
and gave legitimacy to the bigotry of Bal Thakeray, the same bench, by a
queer quibbling, held an elected candidate guilty for his party's
_Hindutva_ bigotry. This course of justice, which lets the top leaders off
the hook, has in fact given impetus to a theocratic politics that
threatens to destroy democratic values. The observations in the
subsequent case have to be understood as mere lip service to the secular
values of the Constitution. After the damage had been done, the Supreme
Court exhibited the correct perspective in its understanding of what is
bigotry and what is not, by pointing out:

> It is difficult to appreciate how the term '_Hindutva_', or Hinduism per
> se in the abstract, can be assumed to mean and equated with narrow
> Hindu fundamentalist bigotry. Ordinarily, _Hindutva_ is understood as a
> way of life or a state of mind and it is not to be equated with or
> understood as religious Hindu fundamentalism. The word _Hindutva_ is
> used as synonym of 'Indianisation', i.e. development of a uniform
> culture by obliterating the differences between the cultures
> co-existing in the country.[^164]

That was how the courts have fouled the values of democracy in moments
of crisis. The failure to discuss the _ratio_ on secularism set out
elaborately in _S.R. Bommai_ in these election cases is part of the same
trend.

Liberalisation has now stepped into the vacuum created by loss of faith
in the philosophy and processes of social transformation. By emptying
the contents of constitutional principles like equality, political,
economic and social justice, secularism and integrity, it has unleashed
market forces and brought in a new awareness of acquisitive power. It is
this thrust of aggressive individualism which is responsible in a sense
for the breakdown of our social institutions. Courts structured on the
dichotomy between justiciable and non-justiciable rights --- the
enforcement of the latter being the fundamental responsibility of the
government --- cannot comprehend the disjuncture berween liberalisation
and constitutional policy in this country, The move away from the
pursuit of stated objectives has led to an intense struggle to access
resources. The attempt to bring forth centralised governance is sought
to be achieved by rallying people of the Hindu majority, not on a
platform of social equity but on a theocratic basis. Hindu society is
divided on the basis of an iniquitous hierarchical structure, and the
struggle to end this is ongoing. Despite this the current political
leadership has erected a monolithic religious structure, and this can be
done only by rallying the oppressed castes together to attack the
minorities in the country on the one hand, and to continue a
low-intensity war on our Muslim neighbour on the other. Subordinating
the minorities appears to be the primary objective. The repetition in
Gujarat of genocidal trends is a pointer.

In the absence of a strong and cohesive political movement committed
to social change, the field has been cleared for godmen and
religious cults to enter the political space. Worshippers are
increasingly strident and aggressive, both in appearance and
behaviour. Some members of the Ayyappa cult wore black clothes and
went barefoot, toting guns in the old city of Hyderabad during
communal riots. We have even seen the President, the Prime Minister,
Chief Ministers, Governors, and judges of the Supreme Court and high
courts sitting at the feet of Satya Sai Baba in their official
capacity, and using other official facilities to interact with him.

The criminal justice system has a long history, and its evolution
symbolises a struggle against arbitrary and authoritarian power. The
electoral system has no such history. In the case of a criminal
prosecution, the accused has the possibility of forfeiting his life
or liberty according to the offence he is charged with. In the case
of an elected candidate, no such possibility exists. The right to
vote or the right to contest an election, according to the courts,
are mere statutory rights and therefore do not possess that
character of inalienability which an accused has. The dispute in an
election trial is between the contesting candidates, and though
there is a myth that the entire constituency is interested, no such
consideration plays any role in the ultimate result of the case.
