# A Code of Conduct for Judges

Like the robe of the pastor, it is designed to transform the wearer into
the instrument of a higher power. The risk is that the judge will start
thinking that he is the higher power. The likelihood increases when he
proclaims from the bench to people who cannot differ with him and
acquires a complacent confidence in his own view of things.[^204]

It is recorded in the Mirror of Justices that the Saxon king Alfred the
Great hanged forty-four judges in one year for violating the code of
conduct prescribed for judges.[^205]Long before constitutions, Alexis
de Tocqueville, the separation of powers and the principle of natural
justice, Alfred the Great had laid down some rules for his judges. He
had a right to, for he had appointed them. If they acknowledged bad
judgments made out of ignorance, he scolded them as follows:

> I wonder truly at your insolence, that whereas by God's favour and
> mine, you have occupied rank and office of the wise, you have
> neglected the studies and labours of the wise. Eithet, therefore, at
> once give up the discharge of the temporal duties which you hold, or
> endeavour more zealously to study the lessons of wisdom.[^206]

He was obviously aware that learning is not a prophylactic against
corruption. So he commanded:

> Judge thou very fairly. Do not judge one judgment for the rich and
> another for the poor; nor one for the one more dear and another for
> the one more hateful.[^207]

The maladies which King Alfred found among his judges continues to
plague societies today.

Arbitrariness in governance, degenerating into tyranny, led to revolts,
rebellions and revolutions and finally, the laws and procedures which
should regulate the workings of the institutions of governance and
justice. These found their definition in their present form during the
period when the English struggled against and successfully defeated
Stuart absolutism, culminating in the English Revolution. This marks the
beginning of the rule of law. There was never any visible severance with
the past. Rather, it was by a patient theoretical reformulation and
redefinition over long periods of time that the break with arbitrary
justice was effected. But alongside these developments, the absolutist
trends against which the people had struggled were dexterously woven
into jurisprudence and theories of law. The power of the king was
transferred to Parliament and the courts. The privileges which
Parliament had claimed against the king were transformed into privileges
against the people who elected it. Similarly, the courts were given
independence against interference by the king mainly to protect the
realm against arbitrariness. But very often they ended up working on the
side of Parliament and the executive in perpetuating and justifying
arbitrary governance, whenever it seemed that the people were in a state
of insurrection. Ironically, it was in the process of securing rights
for the people and establishing the rule of law that Parliament had
claimed contempt powers against citizens as well as absolute powers of
legislation. The limits of its legislative power are exposed by the
example given.

Theorists of parliamentary democracy were of the view that parliamentary
power is absolute and expansive, a power which no absolutist monarch had
ever claimed. This has not gone unquestioned by those who have started a
movement for the inclusion of entrenched rights in the English
constitution. Historically, the power of the absolute monarch has been
appropriated by the legislature and the courts. However, the powers of
the legislature and the executive are limited by periodic elections,
which act as a check on authoritarian trends. There are also judicial
reviews by the courts of executive actions and legislative measures. By
contrast, no systematic attempt has been made to contain the absolute
powers of the court without impairing its independence. Any attempt at
reforming the judiciary is read as eroding its independence. But
judicial independence is not a value in itself; it is expected to
subserve the social values incorporated into the Constitution. Despite
this assurance of independence, our courts have not promoted democracy,
personal liberty, or social, economic and political justice in the fifty
years since the Constitution.

Judicial independence coupled with contempt power has made the
institution absolutist. Such an institution can never be the bulwark of
democracy. The judiciary has appropriated the contempt power the king
had and turned it into an aspect of justice. But this power was an
emanation of royal authority, and any contempt of court was really
contempt of the monarch. Under our Constitution the people are
sovereign. No legitimate inference can be drawn that the Constitution
has delegated to the courts the sovereign power to punish the people or
any one among them. Just as the Indian Parliament inherited the
privileges of the House of Commons, the Indian courts have inherited
their contempt power from the king of England. The courts in India trace
their genealogy of power to the royal power of punishing people for
contempt and its subsequent metamorphoses. This power was transformed
into a power which inheres in a court of record, and the offence has
become sui generis, transcending the limits of reasonable restraint. The
myth of the original court of records in which the power of punishing
for contempt inheres has become part of the 'occult jurisprudence' in
which our law abounds. Such anachronisms coupled with irremovable tenure
leads to misconduct among the judges. To the principle that untrammeled
power, whether _de jure_ or _de facto_, encourages impunity, the judiciary
is no exception. These powers are absolute, and one cannot even plead
justification in the public interest when accused of contempt. Even our
elected representatives do not have such absolute powers. An
authoritative statement on the character and magnitude of the contempt
power will demonstrate why a code of conduct for judges may not really
be effective:

> It is an offence purely sui generis, and ... its punishment involves in
> most cases an exceptional interference with liberty of the subject,
> and that, too, by a method or process which would in no other case be
> permissible, or even tolerated ... The jurisdiction should be exercised
> the more carefully in view of the fact that the defendant is usually
> reduced, or pretends to be reduced, to such a state of humility, in
> fear of more severe consequences if he shows any recalcitrancy, that
> he is unable or unwilling to defend himself as he otherwise might have
> done.[^208]

Having been fed on hope and illusions, all of us applaud our judges for
prescribing for themselves a code. But this code contains principles
which are merely pious homilies that cannot be enforced and can be
breached at will. The conduct the judicial code addresses are old habits
which die hard. The Chief Justice, who is only first among equals, has
no authority to even command his colleagues to commence their sittings
strictly according to the prescribed timings.

The private and public life of a constitutional appointee cannot be
separated. One cannot be unjust, unequal and arbitrary in personal life
and claim to adjudicate constitutional principles competently and fairly
in the courts. Talking about professional ethics, Durkheim has raised
issues which seem to be quite relevant in today's context:

> A way of behaviour, no matter what it be, is set on a steady course
> only through habit and exercise. If we live amorally for a good part
> of the day, how can we keep the springs of morality from going slack
> in us? We are not naturally inclined to put ourselves out or use
> self-restraint; if we are not encouraged at every step to exercise the
> restraint upon which all morals depend, how should we get the habit of
> it? If we follow no rule except that of clear self-interest in
> occupations that take up nearly the whole of our time, how should we
> acquire a taste for any disinterestedness, or selflessness or
> sacrifice?[^209]

If they are to abide by moral precepts, do the judges require a code of
conduct like clerical staff? Does not the Constitution imply a code of
conduct? The objectives enumerated in the Preamble to the Constitution,
the fundamental rights and fundamental obligations enumerated in Part
IV, and the constitutional oath prescribed for judicial appointees
regulate their work in the courts, and the same values give rise to
moral principles on which to regulate their conduct in life. A whole
lifetime spent in seeking career enhancement brings about a debasement
of public morality. The colonial mind-set and the feudal and caste
practices which everyone of us has internalised is still the predominant
culture of our judicial institutions. These are compounded by an
adversarial legal culture which is unredeemingly competitive and is
therefore impervious to social mores and social purposes. The
Pharisaical righteousness, the aggressive, authoritarian and pompous
demeanor and other feudal habits, and the discourse in the courts inform
even a casual observer that our judiciary is arbitrary, and that no code
of conduct can ever improve its performance unless we invoke against its
members the same principles of deterrence which they so generously
expound in criminal cases. The first step towards reforming the
judiciary is to democratise its structure and mode of discourse. One
could begin by getting rid of the professional robes, a symbol of power.
The simulated obsequiousness which one is a witness to in the courts is
quite disgusting, and it goes with the colonial-feudal structure. The
mode of address inside the courtroom gets transformed into a title and
we find judges being addressed as 'Your Lordship' outside the court, in
seminars or on any occasion where a judge is participating or is merely
present! The expression 'Justice is similarly used to address judge who
has demitted his office, as if it were a title. Though we have abolished
titles, the habit continues. The institution should be exposed to public
criticism by confining its contempt power to a very narrow field of
administration of justice. This will discipline the institution.
Everything about the courts requires a radical transformation, and the
first step should be to discard colonial and feudal vestiges to give the
institution the democratic visage it so badly needs. A second bur not
last step would be to liberate the legal profession from its
self-imposed servitude, which is seen as a part of a lawyer's
professional competence.
