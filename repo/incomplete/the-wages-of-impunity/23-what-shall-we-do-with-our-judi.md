# What Shall We Do with Our Judiciary?

Our politicians are convinced that public property exists to be
appropriated and that public appointments have been created only to be
distributed as patronage to kith and kin, the near and dear, and to
hangers-on and sycophants. Once a person is elected in this country, his
or her heirs will also get elected as successors to the office. In
non-elective positions too, although this principle of hereditary
succession obtains, it may not be as visible as in the case of
politicians. This practice corrodes. Further, persons appointed to an
office help favourites to plunder at will the institutions they preside
over. The honest within these institutions are not willing to stand up
against these trends for the simple reason that they do not want to
jeopardise their careers. I am laying stress on the obvious only to
point out that very often we transfer our inadequacies onto the system
and lull ourselves into believing that a mere change in form will remedy
the defects.

If we go back to the Constituent Assembly debates, we will find that the
primary anxiety was to secure an independent judiciary. No modification
we suggest should jettison this very important requirement. We fought
Indira Gandhi because she wanted a committed judiciary. Today we have a
judiciary peopled by mediocrities; if there are any exceptions it can
only be due to oversight. They are not 'hindered' by any vision or world
view. When Nehru declared that India had made a tryst with destiny, he
was dreaming about the emergence of a new democratic order in the hope
that it 'would exhibit a new kind of political community composed in
large part of moral aristocrats.' Talking about American society, Cahn
points out that what was originally a charming vision had become a
matter of arresting urgency. He states:

> It is no longer merely desirable, it is virtually indispensable that
> American society produce a multitude of superhuman beings, men and
> women of understanding, judgement and moral rectitude, of expansive
> horizons and humane sensibilities who can feel the full pathos of
> individual misfortunes and predicaments, yet venture to act on
> occasion as though the world were plastic.[^199]

Pointing out the importance of the personal requirement in all
decision-making processes, he is of the view that the

> best and wisest propositions of social ethics, politics and law will
> not preserve us if the men who apply them to concrete transactions are
> themselves Philistines and mediocrities, even affable mediocrities.
> Nothing earthly can preserve us without sharply improved human
> qualities of leadership and citizenship.[^200]

In order to prevent/eliminate political influence even at the stage of
initial appointment and ensure the presence of merit and independence in
the judiciary, the Supreme Court opted for the primacy of the Chief
Justice of India along with two of his senior judges in the matter of
appointment of judges to the their body, and the Chief Justice of India
in consultation with, if necessary, one or two senior judges of the
concerned High Court with reference to appointments to the
latter.[^201] In the process, they laid down the entire procedure to
be followed, up to the issue of the warrant of appointment. The
procedure set down by them is based on the word 'consult' as used in
Article 142. They legislated their hegemony into these constitutional
provisions by the device of interpretation, without improving the
quality of the judiciary.

The three leading judges of the apex court have appropriated the power
of appointment to themselves on the questionable assumption that they
are 'pure and virtuous'. What does not seem to enter into consideration
is that independence, whether of the judiciary or of the profession as a
whole, is not a virtue in itself. While Indira Gandhi destroyed the
institution on the ground that only politically committed persons could
qualify, we have swung to the other extreme and produced an institution
which has become reckless and accountable to none. The way it has
expanded its power base is reflected in the judgements of the court on
its contempt jurisdiction and the magnitude of its power under Article 142.

By interpreting these articles, the institution has unabashedly
appropriated and exercised arbitrary powers. Raising one's voice while
arguing has been interpreted as contempt. This enforces the obsequious
conduct of a bygone era quite successfully even today. Having been
theoretically reborn after the coming into force of the Constitution,
the court unfortunately traces its legacy back to the British by
interpreting the Constitution as a continuation of the Royal Charter,
thus making a mockery of the struggle for independence that gave birth
to the Constitution and the value system which it engenders. Even today,
the power of the Chief Justice is traced to Section 108(2) of the
Government of India Act, 1915, read with Section 223 of the powers to
the Chief Justice in the matter of allotting cases and 1st because the
emerging political movements and struggles Government of India Act,
1935, thus conferring quite arbitrary work to various judges
constituting the High Courts. Obviously, this overriding power was given
to the Chief Justice by the 1915 meant there would be many arrests and
prosecutions in the courts, and in such circumstances the power to allot
cases was critical to the British.

This recounting of history is necessary for an informed debate on the
need to democratise and overhaul the judiciary. There is nothing
democratic about the institution as it is now constituted, either in the
manner in which it is staffed or in its functioning and the discourse
within the courts. An adhoc approach to these matters may not lead to
any improvement. Nor is it likely to reduce corruption, which only
bothers elite lawyers, because a corrupt judge at that level will erode
their income, not that of the majority in the profession. The existence
of corruption has never intimidated the profession as a whole. In fact,
lawyers have used corruption to secure benefits for their clients. As
long as this continues, corruption cannot be eliminated.

Justice V. Ramaswamy sat on the bench despite an enquiry against him.
There were advocates who supported and championed his cause. In fact,
the impeachment proceedings turned out to be partisan and politically
contentious, so it failed. The Ramaswamy affair was beset with
litigiousness, which has been the hallmark of our subverted adversarial
system. Even before the impeachment proceedings against him failed, he
secured for judges a right to judicial review of the very parliamentary
process by which impeachment might succeed. This power to review was
traced to the constitutional scheme.[^202] It was described as a blend
of the political and judicial processes. Thus was born a neo-Brahminical
class.

While the hearings of the U.S. Senate's Judicial Committee on the
appointment of Judge Bork were characterised as a national seminar on
how to judge judges, the Supreme Court's views on impeachment
proceedings in Sarojini Ramaswamy is a dissertation on how to judge
Parliament judging judges. In view of these decisions, any suggested
constitutional amendment is subject to judicial review, as also any
action initiated under it. In short, how does one shake up the Hobbesian
absolutism that is presiding over the judiciary? It is comparatively
easier to unseat the political executive. The rule of law is
incompatible with absolutism in the judiciary. It may not be sufficient
to install a judicial commission. It is also important to annul the
effect of the interpretations contained in the above two judgements.
More importantly, the power of judicial review of the stage before
impeachment, and potentially to annul the impeachment, subverts the
constitutional scheme itself. It is a disingenuous exercise to deny
equality to the legislature, which is the basis of the theory of
separation of powers.

The proposed judicial commission should consist of representatives of
Parliament, the sitting Chief Justice of India, his predecessor, and
distinguished academics, all to be nominated by the President. The names
of advocates and district judges recommended for appointment should be
widely publicised. The views of the Bar Council of India and the
concerned state bar councils, as also the views of the All-India Bar
Association and the concerned state bar associations should be invited.
The procedure for assessment of a High Court judge proposed for
elevation to the Supreme Court should follow the same pattern.

The ideal way of eliminating incompetent contenders and manipulation is
to appoint judges through a public hearing by the judicial commission.
No judge should be permitted to occupy the bench for more than ten
years, including the time spent on elevation to the Supreme Court. All
appointees to the judiciary should be around fifty years. Impeachment
should remain without judicial review of the order of removal. The
nature of impeachment proceedings needs to be defined clearly. Just as
the President can be impeached for violation of the Constitution, the
judges should be impeachable for proven misbehaviour and incapacity.
Neither violation of the Constitution nor judicial misbehaviour are
ordinary crimes. When a judge is brought before Parliament, the enquiry
and the debate have reference to the whole of the judiciary and the
damage the judge has caused it. Fixity of tenure and irremovability are
related to his functions while in office, so the public has an
overriding interest in the proper staffing of judicial institutions.
Therefore, when Parliament is conducting impeachment proceedings, it is
acting as a court to preserve the Constitution and its value system. The
adjudicatory process during impeachment should transcend party
considerations. What ordinarily governs parliamentary activities may not
be appropriate for regulating impeachment proceedings. Issuing a whip to
regulate voting on impeachment may damage the functioning of the
institution and destroy its independence, which is so necessary to
preserve the rule of law as a way of life. While preserving impeachment
as a way to remove bad judges, it may be necessary to introduce
provisions to regulate the procedure to be followed in the matter of
debate and voting.

While taking steps to ensure accountability and independence in our
judiciary, it is also necessary to review the concept of independence of
the judiciary. As was pointed out by Simon Shetreet:
