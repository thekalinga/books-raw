# On the Selection of Judges: An Open Letter to the Chief Justice of India

I have spent forty-five years in the legal profession with the growing
realisation that the institution of justice has progressively forsaken
the pivotal role assigned to it after Independence. It has given up the
instrumentalist role assigned to it, although I would not say by design.
The institution was not restructured to play this role. In the deepening
crises of the 1960s and 1970s, the institution's opposition to certain
populist policy initiatives was perceived as the obstructionism of a
conservative court which did not believe in the instrumentalist role
assigned to it by the Constitution. While the accusation is true, using
this as a pretext to destroy the court's independence was uncalled for.
This assault brought to the fore the importance of an independent
judiciary, leading to successful efforts to wrest the power to appoint
judges from the executive and give it to the high courts and the Supreme
Court.

In the first decade of the Supreme Court, an informal system for
selecting judges appears to have worked well. The deterioration started
around the 1960s. On the record it surfaced when Mr. C. Subramaniam
pushed through the case of Justice Alagiriswamy. The Madras High Court
Bar Association unsuccessfully resisted this attempt to fast-forward the
career of a judge. The court ended the case by extending an assurance
that such an attempt may not succeed with the President. However, the
executive had its way and the court was wrong. Though Justice
Alagiriswamy turned out to be a good judge, the method left the
institution damaged. Thereafter, the institution was not seen as having
an independent status with the definite role assigned to it by the
Constitution, but as an arena for the practice of political patronage.
In this situation, the presence of a judge of merit on the bench could
be viewed as an accident or oversight. Also, the present system does not
appear to be beyond manipulation. There does not seem to be a
realisation that staffing this institution is crucial to the
independence we all have striven to secure. Echoing the words of Theodor
Eschenburg, Ralph Dahrendorf points out the importance of a nuanced
understanding of authority in a democratic system. The bearers of
institutional authority must

> be filled by personal authority, which is a delicate balance of
> qualities of leadership, institutional sense and contact with those
> who are affected by decisions. 'Only where these contacts exist but
> leadership remains in the lead, where it knows what needs to be done
> and works convincingly for its solutions, can one speak of authority
> in the democratic sense.' Eschenburg's advice to politicians holds
> mutatis mutandis for judges, police officers and all others with
> special responsibility for human affairs.[^210]

He goes on to say:

> The virtues required of all inhabitants of the institutional edifice
> are even more important. They take us one more time to the homo
> sociologicus syndrome. There are those who practice straightforward
> compliance with norms, whether thoughtless or fearful. They lack the
> imagination or the courage even to consider deviance. Needless to say,
> they are not the stuff from which the citizens of a free society are
> made. They leave norms without meaning and drain the lifeblood of
> institutions. But then there are those who have a peculiar sloppy
> attitude to norms. They recognise them for what they are, on the whole
> observe them, but leave no doubt in the minds of bystanders or those
> on whom the normative force of society is brought to bear, that if it
> was for them these norms would be quite different and might perhaps
> not exist at all. They are players of roles rather than actors who
> merge with their parts. Even while they apply sanctions --- and this
> attitude is particularly frequent among administrators of many
> grades --- they shrug their shoulders with a wry smile as if to say that
> they know fully well what nonsense they are doing but it happens to be
> their job to do it. The result of this attitude is twofold. In
> practice it does not lead to any changes of norms, whether in the
> direction desired by those who apply them or any other direction. On
> the contrary, by their cynical application, prevailing norms are
> confined to the point of ossification. So far as underlying attitudes
> are concerned, on the other hand, the basis for legitimacy is pulled
> away from under the norms. Norms are separated from institutions, and
> the world that emerges combines formal compliance with a profound
> deprecation of all things social.[^211]

I have been fascinated by this formulation of Dahrendorf. It describes
so well the attitude of quite a few judges on the bench. The fear is,
that as the years roll by, their numbers might increase. What has been
left unattended even now is the manner of assessing the aspirants'
competence and fitness to undertake the tasks assigned to them with a
constitutional vision and a determination to abide by the discipline
imposed by constitutional morality. Unfortunately, for over two and half
decades, and for all the debates during this period inside and outside
the courts, not much attention has been bestowed on this aspect, except
when, during the late 1960s and early 1970s, there was a call given for
filling the court with committed judges, their commitment being
propagated as an eligibility criterion. This was rightly opposed, and
that fight will not be complete unless an alternative eligibility
criterion is stipulated. Securing independence from executive
interference without a corresponding assessment criteria is not going to
keep that independence effective and vibrant, particularly when
political heads in the states are making inroads into the judiciary by
other means. Chief Ministers can be and are experts in public relations,
and there have always been more ways than one to undermine the
independence of the institution. Independence can only be maintained by
judges, not mere officeholders. We have seen many of them come and go,
but what has kept this institution alive is a succession of accidents
whereby the constitutional appointees were endowed with merit and
competence. The search for such persons is what needs to be
systematised. There must be progressive reduction of the role played by
chance in all those institutions where persons in authority are not
elected and are irremovable from office.

I am afraid this exercise has to be undertaken. As a first step, in the
interests of the institution and as part of the consultation process, it
may be proper to interact with these aspirants to assess _prima facie_
their ability to articulate sense. But it is imperative that a process
be devised to assess eligibility in keeping with the dignity and
responsibility of the office. These institutions need to be strengthened
as part of an effort to leave behind a better world. I do not think we
can wind up our lives by exclaiming. 'What has posterity done to me that
I should do so much for posterity?'
