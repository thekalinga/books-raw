# Privilege and Obligation

'Free for all in Jammu Kashmir Legislative Assembly' was the headline in
almost all the newspapers on 18 August 1985. A similar ruckus in the
Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly in March 1983 was described in Vaniga
Otrumai, a Tamil monthly of modest circulation, as conduct worthy only
of 'theru porikkikal' (roadside hooligans). This comment was referred to
the Privileges Committee in 1984, and the next year the publisher Paul
Raj was punished with two weeks' imprisonment. According to the finance
minister, 'This would serve as a deterrent and a warning to other
publications which indulged in similar writing which lowered the dignity
of the house.' Another journalist, Cho Ramaswamy, has called the
legislators 'uneducated'. Anyone who knows Cho would say immediately
that this is the mildest term in his repertoire. He can be devastating
and perhaps his respect for the institution was the Cause for his
restraint, but he was charged anyway. In 1984, the Andhra Pradesh
Legislative Council served a contempt notice on Ramoji Rao for the
caption 'Peddala Galaba' (noisy elders) in the Telugu daily Eenadu. A
couple of weeks later, a woman from Andhra called Arundhati was
sentenced to seven days in jail for distributing pamphlets from the
visitors gallery of the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly. The
offences in all these cases was breach of privilege of the house. Paul
Raj can rush to the court and obtain stay orders; Cho, in view of the
position he occupies in the politics of his state, can fight both
outside and inside the court and has the capacity to raise a national
debate on any issue; Ramoji Rao can afford to take matters all the way
to the Supreme Court; but Arundhati went to prison without a protest.
After the breach of privilege motion against Eenadu, several articles
appeared in the press about the privileges of the house and the
jurisdiction of the court to interfere. While this is not the first time
such a debate has been raised, what is almost never questioned is the
character of the power that our legislatures claim for themselves
against the citizens.

As things stand today in matters of privilege, the house is supreme. It
combines in itself the powers of the legislature, the judiciary and the
executive. It decides and declares what its own privileges are and,
based on its own precedents which are not known to anyone else, it
indicts, tries, and awards punishment. It executes its own orders and
denies to any external agency the right to review its conduct in any
matter. Arbitrariness cannot be defined better. Yet few have seriously
questioned the authority of the legislature and the privileges that flow
out of it, which has no basis in history, and which cannot be supported
by any known democratic principle.

Unfortunately, we do not have a tradition of debating the relevance of
conferment of power. The debate always centers around containing power
within limits, but very often power extends outside the purpose which
brought it into existence. Power is generally entrusted to bodies or
institutions to enable them to discharge their obligations effectively.
When institutions lose purpose and are only utilised by those who
operate them for their own ends, then both their performance and the
powers exercised are farcical. One can see that this has happened to
representative bodies like Parliament, the State Legislatures and the
institutions of justice. The public expenditure incurred in maintaining
these institutions bears no relation to the services rendered by them in
terms of efficient management of the society at large. Instead, the
people are entertained with all sorts of confrontations, as if they were
spectators at a sporting event.

The basic and serious issue is that of freedom of speech, the right of a
citizen to criticise, howsoever mildly, the elected representatives. But
a transformation of this simple and fundamental issue into one of
confrontation between the legislature and the judiciary will ultimately
result in legitimising arbitrary power. There is always danger inherent
in converting political issues into purely technical issues of law,
where freedom of speech and expression merely provide the rhetorical
background. When political problems are made technical, then only
experts can solve them. More and more areas of our life are thus being
defined as technical problems and getting removed from the arena of
political debate. The authority of the expert has become a substitute
for the will of the people. The danger of such a course to a democratic
way of life hardly needs emphasis.

Examining the history of the British House of Commons, one can see that
the privileges claimed by its members today are distortions and, in
fact, represent the very arbitrariness against which they had fought in
the early stages.[^214] The House of Commons did not secure the power
to be the sole arbiter of the conduct of its members until the Tudor
period. Earlier, the members could defend their privilege of freedom
from arrest only by petitioning the king or the House of Lords. The
Speaker had no power to procure a writ of privilege by his warrant, and
the members could not summon an imprisoned member and his jailor before
them as they were able to do later. They had no control over elections,
nor could they ask any member to depart early from Parliament. Even to
fix the time of their meetings, they had to petition the king. They also
had to beg the king for forgiveness if in the course of their speeches
they had said anything to displease him or which infringed on his
prerogative. John Doroward prayed in 1399

> that what he should thus say in this parliament on behalf of the said
> commons should not be interpreted as coming from him personally or on
> his own individual initiative.[^215]

In 1378, a petition to the king reads as follows:

> Firstly, on behalf of the commons. Should he happen to say anything
> which might sound as prejudicial, damaging, slanderous or evil towards
> our lord the king or towards his crown or as belittling the honour and
> estate of the great lords of the kingdom, this should be ignored by
> the king and the lords as if it had never been said. Because the
> commons are moved by nothing save an overriding desire to maintain and
> safeguard the honour and the estate of our lord the king and the
> rights of his crown in all things and (by wish) to preserve the
> reverence due to the other lords in everything.[^216]

Whatever its composition or class character, the Commons was subservient
to the king and the lords of the realm. Its supplications are not
assertions of freedom to criticise the king, nor early signs of modern
parliamentary government. They are an episode in the struggle for power
between the feudal barons and the king. In the period prior to the
Tudors, the test of strength was not between the king and his lords.
During this period, the Commons was an unorganised body and its speaker
was a member elected to report its wishes to the king.

Until 1515, no member could absent himself without the permission of the
king. But this year saw the first of a new power under which a member
could leave Parliament before its close with the permission of the
Speaker. This is the first recorded assumption by the Commons of control
over its members. In 1523, however, we still find Sir Thomas More
petitioning the king as speaker:

> The mynd is often so occupied in the matter, that man rather studieth
> what to say, than how ... It may therefore like your most abundant
> Grace ... to give to all your Commons here assembled your most gracious
> license and pardon freely, without doubt of your dreadful displeasure,
> every man to discharge his conscience, and bouldly in everythinge
> incident among, declare his advise, and whatsoever happeneth any man
> to say, it may like your noble Majestic of your inestimable goodnesse
> to take all in good part, interpreting every man's words, how
> uncunningly soever they may be couched, to proceed yeat of a good
> zeale towards the profitt of your realme and honour of your Royall
> person.[^217]

The struggle --- if petitioning for permission to speak freely is a form
of struggle --- was directed against the king. No demand was ever made to
permit the members to govern themselves, nor were they bold enough to
assert the right to frame a form of religion which was one of the
burning issues during that period. The members were petitioning the king
on their own behalf, but it would also be fair to say that they were
seeking this limited right on behalf of the people who sent them to the
Commons. Any extended claim might have been dismissed with the words:
'No ruler fit for his state would suffer such absurdities.'[^218]

During the reign of Elizabeth I, the elaborate and obsequious
petitioning was given up. The Commons demanded curtly

> that the Assembly of the Lower House, may have frank and free
> Liberties to speak their Minds, without any Controulment, Blame,
> Grudge, Menaces or Displeasure, according to the old antient
> Orders.[^219]

This assertion was in conformity with the time and its rising spirit of
independence. We find the Commons describing its right to free speech as
'an ancient and undoubted privilege'. The reply to these petitions
always indicated, however, that the control of free speech was with the
king: 'The king will not deny honest freedom of speech,' or Sir Nicholas
Bacon's assertion that the petition was granted so the Commons

> be neither unmindful, or uncareful of their Duties, Reverence and
> Obedience to their Sovereign.[^220]

Slander and riotous conduct in Parliament were viewed as acts of
indicipline, and the Crown retained the right to regulate the conduct of
its members.

It was the Wentworth brothers, Paul and Peter, in the second half of the
16th century, who made the first attempt to define freedom of speech and
claim it as a privilege against the Crown. When the queen exercised her
right to veto a Commons discussion on succession, Paul Wentworth used
the occasion to assert that the Queen's veto was a breach of
liberty.[^221] His brother, Peter Wentworth, carried on the fight. A
plentitude of freedom, he maintained, was Parliament's right, on both
theoretical and practical grounds. He attacked limitations to free
speech and sought to limit the Crown's right of punishment to traitorous
words.[^222] The royal prerogative asserted against the Commons was
seen as arbitrary then, but it is now asserted by the same house against
the people it represents.

In 1397, a bill introduced by one Haxey, containing a bold attack on
Richard II and his courtiers, was accepted by the Commons. The House of
Lords treated the bill as traitorous and condemned Haxey to die. But for
the Archbishop's intervention the sentence would have been carried
out.[^223] In 1454, the Speaker, Thomas Thorpe, was imprisoned for his
opposition to the Duke of York. When the Commons demanded their Speaker
back, the Lords denied the petition.[^224] Strode, a member of the
Commons was imprisoned for having proposed certain bills in Parliament
to regulate the privilege of tin miners.[^225] A statute was then
passed by the Commons declaring the proceedings against him void and of
no effect. There was also a general declaration chat no member could be
prosecuted for anything said in the present or future parliaments. In
1571, Strickland was ordered not to appear again in Parliament for
having introduced some ecclesiastical bills. In 1576 and 1588, Peter
Wentworth was committed to the tower for having made trenchant speeches
about freedom of debate. A compliant Commons was used by Elizabeth to
commit him to the tower the first time.[^226]

The House of Commons in fact had an authoritarian origin. It used to
always assemble on royal summons. When the king summoned Parliament it
assembled as a response to his command, and by summoning he was seeking
his own ends. The Commons during this period remained for long

> in the outer darkness of unessentials; and even when they emerged into
> parliamentary light they were scarcely capable of positive
> attitudes ... [^227]

Their importance grew when the Tudors needed their support to put down
the barons and the Church.

It was during the Stuart period that there was open confrontation
between the king and Parliament. Any aura this institution has acquired
was on account of the defiant fight it put up during the reign of the
Stuarts, leading to the revolution of 1688 and the offer of the crown to
William of Orange. By securing this power to decide succession to the
throne, the institution acquired the power vested in the king hitherto.
In 1614, James I dissolved Parliament and committed four of its members
to the tower. In 1621, he asserted that the privileges of the Commons.

> were derived from the Grace and the permission of our ancestors and
> us, for most of them grow from precedents which show rather a
> toleration than inheritance.[^228]

The rejoinder of Sir Edward Coke (1552--1634), Chief Justice of the
King's Bench, shows the changes that had been brought about by the times
and forced on the existing power structure, In an impassioned address he
asserted:

> The privileges of this House is the nurse and life of all our laws,
> the subjects beat inheritance ... When the king says he cannot allow
> our liberties of right, this strikes at the root. We serve here for
> thousands and ten thousands ... Let us make a protestation, enter it in
> the journals to the king --- but not as requiring an answer.

The protestations delivered to the king asserted freedom of speech and
informed him that

> the liberties, franchises, privileges and jurisdictions of Parliament
> are the ancient undoubted birth right and inheritance of the subjects
> of England.

The king, sitting in the council chamber, sent for the journals and, in
the presence of the lords and the judges, tore out the page upon which
the protestations appeared. Coke and two other Commons leaders were sent
to the tower.[^229]

The fight against the king continued until the Restoration. The
Convention Parliament which met in January 1689 invited William and Mary
to the throne and offered them the crown and a declaration of rights for
their acceptance. This declaration was later passed as the Bill of
Rights. It proclaimed that the freedom of speech and a debate or
proceedings ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or
place out of Parliament.' Thereafter, we do not hear of any arbitrary
acts of arrest by the king, but the Parliament itself assumed the role
of the king when it began claiming for itself the power to punish
citizens who criticised it or its members. The unfettered freedom of
speech which it had obtained from the crown was directed towards the
citizens. Any slanderous attack on a citizen enjoyed total immunity from
the processes of the courts if uttered inside Parliament. On the other
hand, an ordinary citizen was denied the right to criticise Parliament
or its members. Thus the House of Commons, which had started as a mere
petitioning body struggling to secure freedom of speech to criticise the
king, transforming itself into opposition to the king's absolute reign
during the Stuart period, itself became a power after 1688, and started
exercising arbitrary powers thereafter. Each of the houses claimed the
same extensive powers of arbitrary imprisonment which they had earlier
denied to the king and his court of the Star Chamber.

The privilege now claimed for the printed word also has a peculiar
origin. We have seen that the Commons started as a petitioning body and
that anything spoken on the floor of the house against the king could
well, if reported, invite his wrath. As a measure of self-protection,
therefore, the Commons kept its proceedings secret. Thus the house could
order out strangers and direct that its proceedings could not be
reported. What was initially a safety measure adopted by Parliament to
protect itself and its members against the arbitrary exercise of power
by the king later became transformed into a privilege against freedom of
the press.

The extension of privilege from words uttered to the printed word gave
rise to the celebrated case of Stockdale vs. Hansard in 1839. The firm
of Hansard, under the authority of the house, had printed a report of
the inspector of prisons which contained defamatory words about one
Stockdale, who then brought an action against Hansard. The latter
pleaded the authority of the house as a complete defence and a jury
accepted this statement. But Chief Justice Denman and other judges held
that this was no defence. Stockdale sued for damages and obtained a
verdict for 600 pounds. It was the House of Commons that had treated the
case as a breach of privilege and not allowed the printer to use any
defence except the order of the house. When Stockdale sought to collect
his damages, the house sent him, his solicitor and the sheriffs who had
executed the orders of the court to prison. The sheriff sought to obtain
a writ of _habeas corpus_, but a court of the King's Bench refused to
issue such a writ because the Sergeant at Arms had filed a return
stating that they were under a warrant of the Speaker for
contempt.[^230] The sheriffs had to remain in prison for having
attempted to execute a warrant issued by the court, i.e. for performing
a legal duty!

We in India have no history of struggle in the legislature, so we are
bereft of precedents in this field. Our struggle basically was against
British rule. But our antagonism to British rule did not prevent us from
adopting the British system of governance. We have all been bred in the
British liberal tradition, hence the unwillingness to examine the
validity and relevance of the various concepts which were introduced
into the superstructure. The claim of privilege against the citizens
might have been a valid transitional power immediately after 1688 in
England. It might have been one of the means of pre-empting the
regrouping of monarchical forces. But its continuance without a
rationale would be to legitimise arbitrary power. When the Constituent
Assembly debated draft Article 85 relating to the privileges of members
of parliament, H.V. Kamath felt:

> There is nothing derogatory to the dignity of our Constitution or of
> our State in making reference to the United Kingdom. It may be further
> reinforced by the argument that now that we have declared India as a
> full member of the Commonwealth, certainly there should be no
> objection, or any sort of compunction in referring to the House of
> Commons in England. But may suggest for the serious consideration of
> the House as to whether it adds --- it may not be derogatory or detract
> from the dignity of the Constitution --- but does it add to the dignity
> of the Constitution? Will it not be far better, far happier for us to
> rely upon our own precedents or our own traditions here in India than
> to import something from elsewhere and incorporate it by reference in
> the Constitution? Is it not sufficient to say that the rights and
> privileges and immunities of Members shall be such as have been
> enjoyed by the Members of the Constituent Assembly or Dominion
> Legislature just before the commencement of the Constitution?[^231]

Alladi Krishnaswami Iyer intervened to point out:

> If the privileges are confined to the existing privileges of
> legislatures in India as at present constituted, the result will be
> that a person cannot be punished for contempt of the House ... whereas
> the Parliament in England has the inherent right to punish for
> contempt.[^232]

He found nothing derogatory in the provision that was ultimately
incorporated in the Constitution. A legislative committee constituted by
the speaker of the Constituent Assembly also found it difficult to list
parliamentary privileges without going into the whole question of the
working of the same institution in the United Kingdom.

As they originally stood, both Articles 105(3) and 194(3), after
conferring unfettered powers of speech to the members, left it to
Parliament to enact a law defining and enumerating its privileges, and
until then allowed it to enjoy those of the House of Commons of the
United Kingdom. The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 dispensed with the need
to enact a law defining privileges, and stated that the powers,
privileges and immunities of the house and its members were those listed
in Sections 21 and 34 of the act and as may be evolved by the house
later. But then the 44th Amendment Act of 1978 repealed the provisions
of the 42nd Amendment. As matters now stand, Parliament must enact a
law, and until then its privileges are those current immediately before
the coming into force of Sections 18 and 26 of the 44th Amendment.

We are not here concerned with the question of the codification of the
privileges, powers and immunities of the members of State Legislatures
and Parliament. What appears arbitrary, on the face of it, is the power
exercised on citizens who are not members. The State Legislatures and
Parliament are mandated to respect the rights of the citizens as
described in Part III of the Constitution, which includes Articles 14,
19, 21 and 22. Yet today a citizen is helpless against the arbitrary
exercise of power by these bodies.

The reasons given for not codifying the privileges makes interesting
reading. According to Mavlankar, these are as follows:

> i\. Any legislation at the present stage would mean legislation only
> in regard to matters acceptable to the Executive Government of the
> day. It is obvious that, as they command the majority, the house will
> accept only what they think proper to concede. It is important to bear
> in mind that the privileges of members are not to be conceived with
> reference to this or that party, but as privilege of every member of
> the house, whether he belongs to government or the opposition party.
> My fears are, therefore, that an attempt at legislation would mean a
> substantial curtailment of the privileges as they exist today.
>
> \
>
> ii\. My second reason is that any legislation will crystallise the
> privileges and there will be no scope for the presiding authorities to
> widen or change the same by interpretation. Today they have been given
> an opportunity to adapt the principles on which the privileges exist
> in the United Kingdom to conditions in India.

Mavlankar buttressed his views by referring to the Secretary's note:

> Our Constitution has one important peculiarity in that it contains a
> declaration of fundamental rights, and the Courts have been empowered
> to say that a particular law or a part of a law is void or invalid
> because it is in conflict with a particular fundamental right and
> therefore beyond the powers of Parliament.

He went on to assert:

> Once, however, the privileges are codified by an Act of Parliament in
> India, the position changes entirely ... The Statute will be examined
> in the same way as any other Statute passed by Parliament, and the
> Courts may well come to the conclusion that in view of the provisions
> in the fundamental rights, it is not open to any legislature in India
> to prescribe that the Speaker may issue valid warrant without
> disclosing the grounds of commitment on the face of the warrant ... All
> matters would (then) come before the courts and Parliament would lose
> its exclusive right to determine matters relating to its
> privilege.[^233]

Dealing with the same question of codifying parliamentary privileges,
Justice Hidayatullah made the following observations:

> If there is mutual trust and respect between Parliament and Courts,
> there is hardly any need to codify the law on the subject of
> privileges. With a codified law more advantage will flow to persons
> bent on vilifying Parliament, its members and Committees, and the
> Courts will be called upon more and more to intervene. At the moment,
> given a proper understanding on both sides, Parliamentary right to
> punish for breach of its privileges and contempt would rather receive
> the support of Courts than otherwise. A written law will make it
> difficult for Parliament as well as Courts to maintain that dignity
> which rightly belongs to Parliament and which the courts will always
> uphold as zealously as they uphold their own.[^234]

While Mavlankar was concerned about opposition parties and leaving room
for future widening of privileges, he did not address the rights of the
citizens who had elected the representatives in the first place. The
Secretary's note expressed concern about court interference once the
privileges had been codified, because Parliament's attitude has always
been to exclude the jurisdiction of the courts. Hidayatullah's concern
was to avoid a confrontation between the courts and Parliament,
According to him, all criticism of the conduct of Parliament and its
members had to be stopped because some may use the courts to vilify
Parliament. While the contempt jurisdiction of the courts is codified by
Parliament, he wanted to leave parliamentary privileges uncodified on an
unfounded presumption of the likelihood of abuse of court processes. He
felt that a written law would not be conducive to maintaining the
dignity of Parliament.

The dignity of either the courts or Parliament cannot be maintained by
clothing these institutions with arbitrary powers. It can only be
maintained when they function with a sense of social purpose. The
contempt jurisdiction has of late become a cloak for operating these
institutions for personal and sectarian ends without any fear of public
criticism. The concept of sovereignty of Parliament appears to be wholly
irrelevant in a democratic set-up and it has outlived its purpose --- if
at all it had any. The power which the members who constitute Parliament
enjoy is derived from the people, and from this no one can infer
reasonably that the people have conferred absolute, arbitrary powers on
Parliament and the State Legislatures to punish citizens summarily.
There is no evidence to support the inference that the procedures that
Parliament and Legislatures follow with regard to their penal powers can
override Articles 14, 19, 21 and 22 of the Constitution.

The major premise of our Constitutional system is the rule of law. This
has two aspects:

1. that people should be ruled by law and they have an obligation to
    obey it;
2. that the law should be so framed that it is able to guide them.

The first aspect implies that a citizen has information about the law so
that he may conform to it. The second implies that the law must be
capable of being obeyed. If the law is to guide people, they must be in
a position to find out what it is, which means it should be transparent
and adequately publicised. For the same reason, it should be free from
ambiguity or vagueness, especially in cases which involve forfeiture of
liberty. Power-conferring rules are designed to guide behaviour and
should conform to the doctrine of the rule of law if they are to fulfill
their purpose.

To appreciate this, we should know the privileges that were in vogue in
the House of Commons up to 1950, the purpose for which power was
exercised by the Commons, and the extent of freedom permitted by the
Commons to the citizens before it becomes a breach of privilege. Were
there grades of punishment or were they awarded at the whim of the
house? In India, two amendments on the subject have not improved
matters. The 42nd Amendment sought to give unlimited powers to each
house of Parliament to evolve its own privileges and immunities without
interference from anyone outside them. But introducing legislation meant
deliberation in both houses, the President's assent and possible
interference by the courts on the validity or otherwise of such law. The
44th Amendment, while doing away with the rights of Parliament to evolve
its own privileges, has kept intact the original vagueness, and the
necessity for referring indirectly to the privileges of the House of
Commons, which even today are obscure and wholly unnotified.

The latter arbitrariness was recognised by Maitland when he raised the
question and answered it thus:

> For what offences can the House inflict this punishment of
> imprisonment? Our answer must be that it is the power of the House to
> inflict it in a quite arbitrary way.[^235]

He is also of the view:

> Too often we see questions of privilege treated as party questions,
> and then the House, whatever it may think of itself, becomes truly
> contemptible. That it has a very dangerous power in its hand is too
> obvious.[^236]

De Smith, dealing with the British Parliament and its power to punish
breaches of privilege, is of the view that despite the fact that judges
are not always better equipped to decide questions of law set in a
political context:

> the unhappy combination of uncodified contempts, an unsatisfactory
> procedure for investigating allegations of contempt, and the
> insistence of the House that it must have the first and last word in
> matters touching the interests of its members as members, irrespective
> of the impact of its decisions on the interests of members of the
> public, strongly suggests that the House should relinquish its
> jurisdiction over breaches of privilege and contempts to the courts,
> as it has in effect relinquished its privilege to determine disputed
> election returns.[^237]

Harry Street draws a distinction between disciplining members of
Parliament and extending this power over citizens, and holds that 'the
House of Commons ought not to treat the trial of citizens as one of its
functions; disciplining its members is one thing, punishing outsiders is
another.' The English Revolution effectively used a parliament that had
been set up by medieval kings. Its authoritarian origin was masked by
its later transformation into an effective forum to fight royal
absolutism. The original antagonism between the bourgeoisie and royalty
has become a conceptual unity between popular sovereignty and the divine
right of kings. A new rationale has been found to justify a
representative's arbitrary power: that it is necessary to enable him to
discharge his public trust with firmness and to protect him from the
resentment of those offended by the exercise of his right. The
parliamentary institution was created and extended social support to
give the citizens the freedoms needed to ensure political progress; yet
exercising the freedom to discipline this institution has become an
offence.

In our society, where respect for authority has been internalised,
arbitrary power is perceived as a valid exercise of authority, so abuses
go unquestioned. Those who perceive the abuse do not wish to enter into
confrontation. They make their peace by cajoling and appeasing
authority. We seldom realise that the measure of freedom we enjoy is the
extent conceded to political dissent, the poor and the oppressed. Let us
look at what happened to Arundhati. More than the cases of Cho, Paul Raj
and Ramoji Rao, Arundhati's punishment shows the arbitrariness
forefeited summarily and casually, in one of the innumerable of the
power exercised by our legislatures. Her liberty was instances where
Article 21 remained muted. She entered the Andhra Assembly with the
proper permission, viewing those assembled there as her representatives,
who would be willing to hear her tale of woe. She had not been informed
that circulating pamphlets containing only her grievances was an offence
and a violation of the privileges of the house. She could not defend
herself because she was not aware that the representatives that she and
millions of others had voted to office had been entrusted the power to
punish people summarily. She was not aware of the precedents of the
British House of Commons, nor that there were parliamentary privileges
whose breach would entail punishment. In all these cases, nobody is told
which particular privilege has been breached, nor whether what is
breached belonged to the House of Commons or specially evolved by an
Indian Legislature. Ayn Rand says:

> Just pass the kind of laws that can neither be observed nor enforced,
> nor objectively interpreted --- and you create a nation of lawbreakers
> and then you cash in on guilt ... The only power any government has is
> the power to crack down on criminals.

This philosophy informs all our institutions, including the Legislatures
and Parliament.
