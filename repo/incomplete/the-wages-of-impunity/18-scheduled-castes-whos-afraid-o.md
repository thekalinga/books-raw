# Scheduled Castes: Who's Afraid of the Law?

Gundumull is a village in the Kodangal taluq of the district of
Mahaboobnagar in Andhra Pradesh. It is 147 kilometres from Hyderabad and
57 kilometres from Mahaboobnagar, which is the district headquarters.
The segregation of _Dalits_ is a fact of life; it is even incorporated in
the policies of the state government. For instance, the acquisition of
land to house the _Dalits_, which is a major social welfare activity of
the state government, perpetuates this practice of segregation.
Gundumull is no exception.

Gopala Reddy, the _sarpanch_ of the village, is a big landholder and a
member of the Congress (I). Within the four walls of an old dilapidated
fort, about half a kilometre away from the main village of Gundumull,
live the _Dalits_ --- Malas and Madigas, There are in the village about
fifteen restaurants; all are owned by Telugus and one is run by a Muslim
called Hashim. In all these eateries, a separate set of cups and dishes
are kept for the _Dalits_. A _Dalit_ wanting to buy a cup of coffee or tea
has to pick up one of the cups himself and get his beverage poured into
it. Later he has to wash the cup and put it back in its place.

On May 8, 1984, Solapurapu Venkataiah, Borsa Balappa and Borra Aashappa
went to the village with two of their friends and asked for tea. When
asked to use the cups kept separately, they refused and demanded that
they be served tea like any of the caste Hindus. All the restaurants
refused. The five men came to Hashim's place. He too refused, on the
ground that _Dalits_ eat pigs.

The young men then went straight to Kosgi police station, about 12 km
away from the village, and lodged a written complaint against Hashim and
five others, accusing them of practising untouchability. Under the
Protection of Civil Rights Act, this is a cognisable and non-bailable
offence.

The next day, the head constable and sub-inspector of Kosgi police
station drove down to Gundumull on a motorcycle to make enquiries. In
the restaurant run by Hashim, they seized the separate cups and other
containers. They arrested six persons, including Hashim and his brother.
They then proceeded to the _panchayat_ office to prepare a panchanama of
the seizure.

Immediately, 500 villagers surrounded the policemen and demanded that
the _Dalits_' written complaint be handed over to them. Meanwhile, some
other villagers deflated the tyres of the motorbike. Not having come
with sufficient force, the two policemen returned to their station soon
after, leaving behind those they had arrested. Incidentally, the
sub-inspector himself belonged to a Scheduled Caste.

The following day, the deputy superintendent of police, Narayanpet,
visited the village along with a tahsildar and the sub-inspector. They
tried to persuade the villagers to give up the practice of
untouchability, trying to conciliate instead of seeking to enforce the
law. The villagers continued their defiance of the law and of authority.
The officer finally managed the formal act of arresting the six persons
named in the complaint and took them to the Kosgi police station, but
they were released the same evening.

The _Dalit_ youths had filed a complaint against the Muslim Hashim alone,
though all 15 places had discriminated against them. They must have
hoped that the caste Hindus would not then oppose their complaint.

After these events, the _sarpanch_, Gopal Reddy, called a meeting of the
villagers. There a decision was taken to boycott the _Dalits_ of the
village. The decision included refusal to supply groceries or any other
services that are normally made available on payment of consideration.
Even beedies and toddy were not to be sold to the _Dalits_. Persons
committing breach of these decisions were to pay a penalty of â‚¹500.
Consequently, the _Dalits_ had to trek 12 kilometres daily to Kosgi to buy
the provisions they required.

The weekly shandy (market) is important for the villagers. Friday, May
11, was shandy day. The decision promulgated by the _sarpanch_ was in full
force. Five marriages were to take place in the _Dalit_ wada or enclave.
Cloth had been given to the village tailor to make blouses, shirts and
trousers for the brides and grooms. The village goldsmith had been
handed over gold and money to make mangalasutras for the brides. The
tailor returned the uncut cloth and the goldsmith refused to make the
jewellery, The banana leaves used to serve food to the guests were also
not made available. The _Dalits_ were not allowed to board the
government-owned buses from the village bus stand. They were also told
not to enter the village. The _Dalits_ were afraid of violence to their
person if they defied the boycott; as usual, they had no support from
any quarter. The government at the district level had proved ineffective
and too slow to enforce their legitimate rights under the provisions of
the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955.

A few months earlier, a more violent incident had taken place in the
same district in a village called Chinthagudem, near Balanagar. There, a
landlord and his goons had attacked the _Dalits_ and driven them away from
the village in a bid to occupy their lands. These lands had been given
away as bhoodan by the landlord's father more than two decades earlier.
After a protracted struggle at the government level, official letters
were issued to the _Dalits_, thus regularising their occupation of the
lands. However, this time, it was the turn of all the _Dalits_ of the
village to be held in custody. This was justified by the sub-inspector
on the argument that the landlord and his men were in a minority and had
therefore to be given protection!

Yet, long ago in 1947, Article 17 had been adopted as proposed by Dr.
Ambedkar amidst shouts of 'Mahatma Gandhi ki jai'. Members of the
Constituent Assembly representing the Scheduled Castes had welcomed this
article as a historic measure that would put an end to a great social
evil. Moreover, the Protection of Civil Rights Act has been on the
statute books since 1955. Though the punishments prescribed by this act
are not severe, very wide powers have been given to the state agencies
to curb the practice of untouchability. To facilitate a just trial, a
special rule of evidence was introduced whereby the normal legal
presumption was reversed to assume, instead, that the accused had
committed the offence of untouchability until the contrary has been
proved. The government has even been empowered to impose a collective
fine on villagers who act in concert.

Nevertheless, violence on _Dalits_ is increasing, and there are protests
against the policy of reservation. Fierce competition for greatly
reduced opportunities has fostered the feeling among the upper castes
that reservation and other facilities given to the lower castes are
responsible for their own difficulties. This feeling is promoted, and is
fully exploited, by many political parties. All economic issues arising
between upper caste landlords and _Dalit_ labourers, too, are converted by
the landlords into 'caste issues', leaving them free to let loose
violent repression, even as other oppressed sections, seeing it as a
'caste issue', fail to join hands with the oppressed _Dalits_.
