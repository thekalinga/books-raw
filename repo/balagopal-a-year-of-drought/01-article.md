_In the absence of a positive policy regarding rain water conservation, the
'natural' process of development destroys mechanisms of storage,
retention and recharge. All of this is part of the phenomenon of 'drought',
whether or not there is a monsoon failure._

\ 

The south-west monsoon is all set to leave the
skies of Andhra Pradesh. Having played _truant_
for the first six weeks and _wilful_ for the next six
it is finally ready to clear out, leaving the people
estimating --- each in their region and locality
--- how much of a drought they are going to face
in the coming year. It is no longer a new thing
to say that official pronouncement of normality
or subnormality of total seasonal rainfall in
each of the districts is a largely meaningless
exercise; and that the amount of rainfall has to
be discussed in conjunction with what has
happened or been done to the storage and
retention mechanisms, processes and facilities
to arrive at a meaningful framework for discussing
drought. What needs to be stressed
anew and described in gory detail again and
again is that these have been destroyed, neglected,
mismanaged or developed in a skewed
way over the years, creating perpetual drought
conditions of varied extent in various pockets,
whether total precipitation of rain is normal or
not. It is when rainfall drops below normal that
the neglect and the one-sided development of
water retention and storage processes is exposed
sharply and gets discussed as drought,
attributed to the meanness of the monsoon.

It is true that the government these days
attributes the shortfall in rain to destruction of
forests and is paying considerable attention to
growing more forests, an attention thai is likely
to increase with growing conservationist pressure
from international bodies on tropical countries
that they should save their forests. Though
our government understandably objects to this
one-sided concern about conservancy in the
third world --- a one-sidedness that affects all
concerns from atomic weapons to forests
--- which has fairly robbed the word 'international'
appended to many world bodies of all
meaning, this conservancy is a good thing as far
as it goes, even if the emphasis on afforestation
as the cure-all for drought, is robbing landless
poor of land that they have been in occupation
of for years and even decades. Indeed, afforestation
is spoken of in such sacred tones by
officials that the poor are left feeling guilty for
even asserting their right to the land they are
banished from. But the destruction of forests is
about all that will be acknowledged by way of
'our sins' in causing drought. The lack of
policies and wrong policies concerning water
retention, storage and use is not treated as
integral to the problem of drought the way
deforestation is. Evidently, any such
acknowledgement would amount to disturbing
too many well-protected interests, many more
than afforestation of land under the occupation
of the poor would.

By the third week of July this year there was
so little rain in Andhra Pradesh that the situation
was frightening. Eighteen of the 23 districts
in the state had received much less than
normal rain, in many cases as little as 15 to 20
percent of normal. For instance, Pargi taluk of
Ranga Reddy district, which has a normal
precipitation of 1,600 mm by end July, had
received only 330 mm by the end of the third
week of July.

# '_PUJAS_' FOR RAINS

The worried government officially commissioned
'_pujas_' and higher _vedic rites_ to placate
'_Varuna_' --- the rain god. The ministry of religious
endowments --- which is presumably closest to
the gods --- was chosen to commission and get
the rites executed. But in keeping with the
present emphasis on private effort, ministers
advised people not to depend for everything on
the government but to perform '_pujas_' on their
own. There is no dearth of _brahmins_ in the
country anyway. Simultaneously, however, the
government prudently undertook cloud-seeding
experiments at chosen localities to cajole
the clouds by secular effort to unburden themselves
of water. And to confound things further
there was a low pressure simultaneously in the
Bay of Bengal, usually an augury of rain on the
eastern coast. It requires statistical analysis of
the kind not yet invented to decide which of
these causes resulted in the tangible effect, but
some effect did result. Meteorologists of Andhra
University rebuked the cloud-seeding experts
who had come from Gujarat for prematurely
patting themselves on the back, and there was
some polemical discussion about the relative
merits of ground-seeding and aerial-seeding of
clouds. Rationalists of various kinds criticised
the government for wasting money on 'kratus'
while it was evident that the rains came because
of the low pressure in the Bay of Bengal. The
_brahmins_ did not deign to join the debate --- they
got their fees anyway --- but no doubt the god
'_Varuna_', being a cautious fellow, prefers to
work his boon through facts of nature such as
a low pressure in the Bay of Bengal for it would
be setting a wrong precedent to let empty skies
rain. Anyway, there was some rain --- heavy in
a few places where cloud-seeding had been
done --- for a couple of weeks, thereby improving
the one statistic the government is interested
in: total precipitation of rain by the end of
the season. The figure climbed closer to normal
in the deficit districts. At one point the government
made bold to say that only 10 districts
were deficit, but at the end it acknowledged that
15 of the originally deficit 18 districts were still
in a deficit, though the deficit was much less at
end-August than at end-July. And that was that.

But the people are concerned with whether
whatever rain has fallen has served their purpose,
and if not why not. This is for them the real
meaning of _drought_. And this is linked to not
just the total seasonal rainfall, but to the pattern
of rainfall, retention of moisture in the soil,
groundwater recharge and availability at cost-wise
accessible levels, state of repair of the
irrigation tanks, siltage of tanks and project
reservoirs, destruction of catchments, sand-quarrying
in the streams that feed the irrigation
tanks, and so on right up to the crop-loan policy
of the rural banks. In the perpetually drought-prone
taluk of Devarakonda in Nalgonda district,
for instance, it rained hard and briefly
once at the beginning of the monsoon, and then
once again a month later. Each time the less
prudent of the farmers hoped for further rain
and sowed seeds --- castor, _jowar_ and _bajra_, in
that order the principal crops of Devarakonda.
The more prudent were wiser. For there was no
further rain, and the moisture in the soil was not
sufficient for the sown seed to sprout and live.
Many of them had to sow a third time at the end
of July when it rained again. But the repeated
demand for seed had in the meanwhile pushed
up the market price of seed by 50 to 100 per
cent, while the banks were not giving crop
loans. The rural banks and the farmers' cooperative
societies --- both of them meant specifically
to provide crop-related loans to farmers
--- bluntly refused loans for those who had
defaulted last season, which meant most of the
poor and middle farmers, for last season had
also been a drought season in Devarakonda.

# SKEWED IRRIGATION POLICY

The point is that such scattered and insufficient
rain is not at all a rarity in places like
Devarakonda. To the extent that the problem is
natural, one can talk --- as politicians incessantly
talk --- of bringing the waters of the
Krishna river to Devarakonda through old or
new irrigation projects. But however many
such projects may be built, a large part of Indian
agriculture --- especially in regions such as
Rayalaseema and Telangana --- is going to be
principally rain-fed for a long time to come, and
what is not rain-fed will depend upon wells and
irrigation tanks which too are fed by local
rainfall unlike canals of river-projects which
may be fed by rains in far-off catchments. And
so measures to conserve rainfall --- in the soil,
under the soil and in the tanks --- are of primary
importance. It is on these that sufficiency or
insufficiency of rainfall depends. It cannot be
said that the government is unaware of this --- atleast
soil conservation and ground water-augmentation
have been part of its avowed objectives
for a long time --- but the sense of urgency
that pervades talk about projects on rivers is
entirely absent here. The former is a resounding
element in the incessant din of Indian politics,
whereas the latter is never a topic of political
polemics or disputes, not to mention hunger
strikes such as Jayalalita's.

It can be fairly said that for all the talk of
expenditure on soil conservation, minor irrigation
and groundwater augmentation --- effectively
the only irrigation policy that the government
of India has  --- is to construct dams across
rivers and improve the statistics of irrigated
acreage by spectacular jumps whenever it can
get the World Bank or somebody else to loan
enough money; and otherwise leave it to individual
cultivators to extend irrigation in their
private fields by private effort through well
irrigation. To aid this effort, diesel and electricity
are provided by the government for
pumpsets, often at a subsidised price. And in
the last two decades borewel technology for
deeper exploitation of ground water is being
extensively encouraged through loans both to
the farmers and the borewell companies. Evidently,
those who cannot raise enough resources
are outside the framework of this extension
of well irrigation. Mere tinkering with
improvement of rain-fed lands, wanton destruction
of irrigation tanks and neglect of
evident opportunities for minor irrigation
works --- opportunities that abound especially
in the hilly and undulating terrain of
Telangana --- that can help both the storage of
rain water in tanks and the augmentation of
ground water, are a corollary to this skewed
policy. All of which becomes starkly evident
and is called _drought_ when the rains fall.

# PREFERENCE FOR LARGE PROJECTS

The rural rich who control provincial politics
in India are not unaware of this --- indeed even
the least literate of the cultivators of drought-hit
areas are fully aware of all this --- and yet you
hear the leaders make little noise about it. The
scientistic ideology of admiration for the kind
of dramatic statistics associated with big
projects --- five lakh acres to be brought under
water at one go and so on --- may be partly
blamed for blunting the awareness of the leaders
and the led. And depending on one's theoretical
proclivities one can then go on to blame
science --- _bourgeois_ male/occidental/white
--- for causing drought. But ideology is only partly
the culprit. The provincial political elite prefers
solutions with dramatic results to less spectacular
measures that add up bit by bit overtime
and geographic space for a variety of reasons.
Their political time-frame is short, often less
than five years and their political idiom is
structured accordingly. When water for five
lakh acres is being promised or demanded, no
mention need be made of which five lakh will
be watered and when, and one can talk of the
whole of one's political constituency being
Hooded with irrigation water in a short while, if
only the government --- or the opposition, or the
World Bank --- were not so cantankerous. That
kind of grandeur is just not possible with soil
conservation. And whereas canals bring only
benefits (or so it seems), soil conservation, tank
maintenance and groundwater augmentation
require some sacrifice, especially on the part of
the rural elite that is misusing natural resources
unconscionably. Finally, big projects yield
politicians clout and money --- for if they are
themselves not civil contractors (most of them
are), then their friends are --- and even otherwise
there are sizeable commissions to be made
from project and canal contracts which cannot
even be imagined in the case of other irrigation
programmes. For instance, reliable gossip has
it that Rambhoopal Reddy, the MLA who recently
vacated the Panyam assembly seat so
that chief minister Vijaya Bhaskar Reddy could
get elected to the assembly, demanded and got
Rs 50 lakh as 'protection money' from the
construction company engaged in building
Canals for the World Bank-aided Srisailam
Right Bank Canal project which runs partly
through the Panyam constituency. It would be
difficult to imagine even one-hundredth of that
amount going the way of local MLAs if the
nation's irrigation policy had been more democratic.

And so the river Krishna, in which there is
little water left for any new projects, becomes
the focus of all discussion of drought in
Rayalaseema and southern Telangana, the principal
areas of drought in Andhra Pradesh. Politicians
talk incessantly of bringing the waters
of the Krishna to their district, whichever it is.
Their plaint that the coastal Andhra districts
have benefited twice over from the Krishna
river is quite true and just. First with the barrage
built across the Krishna river by the British in
the 1850s, and then with the Nagarjunasagar
project of post-independence years --- which was
one of the occasions when Nehru employed his
famous 'temples of modernity' idiom --- the
Krishna waters have been taken up and down
the central Andhra coast to water today's green
revolution fields. The Srisailam project upstream
on the same river was reserved for
hydel[^hydel] production. With persistent agitation by
politicians and people of southern Telangana
and Rayalaseema, Srisailam has been converted
into a multi-purpose project, and canals
are being dug to water parts of Nalgonda in
Telangana and Kurnool and Cuddapah districts
in Rayalaseema. God --- or rather the World
Bank --- willing, the canals will be soon complete.

[^hydel]: Short  form of hydroelectric.

# DESTRUCTION OF TANKS

This is good, and undoubtedly a positive
achievement of the landlord-politician class of
drought-hit Telangana and Rayalaseema, to the
extent that they are responsible for it. But this
class will never talk about the destruction of
tank irrigation and the over-exploitation of
groundwater, sins to which this class and its
government have been a party. Much less will
it talk about the complete neglect of rain-fed
lands in which nobody is at all interested, for
those who have the money can sink a borewell
and the others can go to hell.

And yet the actual nature of the cultivation is
precisely the reverse of these priorities. Eighty-four
percent of cultivated land is rain-fed in
southern Telangana, and 82 percent in
Rayalaseema. Of that which is irrigated, 65 per
cent is irrigated by tanks and wells in
Rayalaseema and 62 percent in southern
Telangana. Canal irrigation is confined to the
remaining. The completion of the Srisailam left
and right canals will not alter the picture
qualitatively. In the foreseeable future.
Telangana and Rayalaseema are going to be
preponderantly rain-fed and yet rain-fed land
figures in the political polemics concerning
drought only as land that is potentially to be
flooded by the waters of the Krishna --- or even
far-off rivers such as the Godavari --- if and
when those waters are brought to the parched
lands of Rayalaseema and southern Telangana.

The way tank irrigation has been destroyed
is both criminal and pathetic. Both Telangana
and Rayalaseema have a large number of irrigation
tanks. While tanks and wells are equal
providers of irrigation in Telangana, in
Rayalaseema wells pre-dominate over tanks.
Most of the Rayalaseema tanks were built
during the reign of the _Rayas_ of Vijayanagar
(after whom the region gets its name) while in
Telangana successive rulers from the Kakatiya
kings onwards paid attention to the building
and the improvement of tanks.

It is customary to hypothesise a 'village
community' that collectively maintained and
benefited from the tanks. That the 'village
community' (whatever that expression conveys)
took an active interest in the tank system
is a fact, but the process was not exactly idyllic.
The maintenance of the tanks was with the
forced labour of the _dalits_ and other lower
castes. If the upper castes also chipped-in with
labour, it was because they were the principal
beneficiaries of the tank system. Even among
them access to tank water was not equitable.
Priority rights were with the dominant landholders
of the dominant castes, and the others
had access only on their sufferance. Such at any
rate was the situation as we know it in the early
decades of this century, and there is no reason
to imagine a golden age of equitable community
spirit that degenerated to depths of self-interest
in the historical equivalent of the age of
'kali' that is, British rule. That there was a
greater community spirit in the medieval Indian
village than is possible in today's world does
not mean that the whole village thought and
acted as one. That community-spirit was principally
caste-centred and did not always extend
to the whole of the village community. Tank
irrigation thrived in conjunction with the caste-determined
rural Indian social structure. Benefits
accrued to those at the top but the maintenance
was with the forced labour (the caste
obligation) of those at the bottom. The British
did nothing to break the caste system but their
system of heavy taxation and other attendant
changes upset the agrarian arrangements of old
to varied extents. With the spread of democratic
ideas and movements, the caste obligation
of the _dalits_ has been socially rejected by
the lower castes and juridically abolished by
the modern Indian state. The state should then
have taken upon itself the burden of maintaining
the tanks, but it did no such thing. The rural
rich were just not interested in maintaining
them if that could not be got done free by the
poor. Instead, they took to well irrigation, improved
upon in later years with electric/diesel
pumpsets and borewells.That took care of their
fields, and they would continue to enjoy their
first priority access to tank water so long as
tanks existed. If the tanks in due course became
defunct due to negligence, then that was that.
They had their electric pumpsets, and deeper
and deeper borewells, and they would put
pressure upon the government for more projects
on far-off rivers to satisfy their political constituency,
but that was about all. The 'village
community' could look after itself. Indeed,
many of them have converted the silted tank
beds into cultivable land parcelled among themselves
or their faithful followers; tanks near
urban centres have had housing plots carved in
their beds with everybody's connivance, and
whole housing colonies have come up in tank
beds close to even small towns. And there are
cases where brick-kilns have been set up in tank
beds.

Thus, we have, parallel to a preponderant
interest in big projects on the part of the state,
and an indiscriminate spread of well irrigation
--- not only geographic spread but a deepening
that goes down to 170 or 220 feet these
days --- a rapid deterioration of the excellent
tank system and total neglect of water retention
capacity of the soil, and of tank and stream
catchments, in both Telangana and
Rayalaseema. Rayalaseema has a lower rainfall
and therefore needs a more careful
husbanding of the soil and of rain water as well
as a more diligent maintenance of tanks. It has
therefore been a bigger sufferer, but certain
parts of Telangana, especially Nalgonda and
Mahbubnagar districts, threaten to match
Rayalaseema in the destructive neglect.

There is, for example, quite a big irrigation
tank at Gooty in Anantapur district of
Rayalaseema. Anantapur being one of the worst
of the drought-hit districts in the country, the
tank had gone dry many years ago and nobody
had bothered about its ill-maintained bund and
silted bed. Suddenly, four years ago, it rained
heavily in the catchment of the tank and water
from the drought-denuded land rushed into the
tank. The tank filled fast and the bund breached,
washing away the Gooty-Guntakal road and
the crops sown all around. The much-awaited
rains left devastated crops and a freshly emptied
tank behind. Commenting on the state of
ill-maintenance of tanks, a local official then
said: "in the good old days it was enough for the
_Reddy_ to snap his fingers and the labourers
would rush to repair the breach ... who commands
such respect these days ..." (_Reddy_, in
Rayalaseema, is both the name of a caste and
the designation of the village headman --- the
'_mukhia_'.) This variant of the idyllic village
community theme that turns up in nostalgic
social science writings expresses the problem
succinctly. The _Reddys_ of Rayalaseema have
not stopped snapping their fingers, but they
have other purposes these days --- such as getting
votes rigged on election day. And the
snapping of fingers is obeyed not as a caste
obligation but as a more complex subservience
to economic, social and political power that is
of little use in re pairing tanks. And so the Gooty
tank remained neglected, though the breach of
four years ago was temporarily filled up with
sand bags. This year there was again a heavy
downpour in the neighbouring hills of Kurnool
district. The water rushing down the naked hillsides
rushed fast into the Gooty tank, once
again filling it and breaching its bund. This time
the Hyderabad-Bangalore national highway
and the Madras-Bombay rail route were temporarily
washed away along with farmers' fields,
and therefore the breach made national news.
The tank is again empty and the farmers in its
_ayacut_[^ayacut] are a bemused lot, for they are told that
rainfall has paradoxically been well above
normal in Anantapur this drought season, and
therefore they need have no fears.

[^ayacut]: The area served by an irrigation project such as a canal, dam or a tank.

# TO THE SLAUGHTER-HOUSE

As we have said above, the wanton destruction
of the tank system has been paralleled by
an alarming over-exploitation of groundwater
by those who can afford the cost. One of the
worst affected districts in this matter is
Nalgonda. Farmers of the arid areas of the
district are no longer talking of dug wells. They
are there, but they have all gone dry and that is
that. They began going dry with shortage of
rain, and then they all went dry as the bores
came. The talk of wells is to talk only of borewells,
and that means only a section of the farming
community is talking of wells. As the bores go
deeper and deeper more and more farmers are
pushed out of the class that has access to
groundwater, for a deep bore renders
neighbouring bores dry, like the hungry roots
of some giant tree whose tubes are reaching lower
and lower into the bowels of the earth to pump
out water into the paddy fields. The borewell
companies too are mostly owned by the rural-elite-turned-businessmen
of the district. It is
these companies of Nalgonda that are at the
forefront of the state's assault on its groundwater resources.

What happens to those who are thus pushed
out of the race? What happens is that when the
rains fail, they join the ranks of those who were
never in the race. They sell off their bullocks,
pair by pair, hoping that the last pair will not
have to be sold, for at least one pair will be
needed if and when it rains. They sell them as
cheap as Rs 1,000 per pair, knowing well that
when the need arises again the bullocks cannot
be bought for less than Rs 3,000 each. The cattle
art driven to the weekly cattle fairs at roadside
village and towns, an institution still widely extant
in Telangana and more so in Rayalaseema. Even
at normal times there is a trickle that goes the way
of butchers, though the principal sales are from
farmer in farmer via middlemen. But with the
onset of drought it is the slaughter-houses that take
over the weekly cattle fair. Dozens of lorry-loads
of cattle are taken away --- the legs of the animals
deliberately broken at the knee joints to prevent
them from jumping off the vehicle --- each week
from almost all the cattle fairs in the drought-hit
districts.

There was, of course, a time when governments
used to have a policy of selling some
amount of partially subsidised fodder to needy
farmers. The amount supplied is usually extremely
inadequate compared to the need --- one
week's fodder for one pair of cattle sold to
about one farmer in a hundred is a fair description
of the relief usually given --- but at least a
token attempt at fodder supply used to be made.
This season the government of AP has not
deigned to indulge in such a tokenism. With
supreme aplomb the farmers were told that the
government would spend money only on _long-term_
measures such as percolation tanks, check
dams and drinking water bores, and would not
spend money on immediate relief for that is a
drain on the budget and does not improve
assets. But as cattle are a _long-term_ asset and
the denial of such a _short-term_ need as fodder
has resulted in a _long-term_ loss, whereas check
dams and percolation Links are such _long-term_
things that they never happen, and the _long-term_
drinking water bores go dry after a _short-term_,
the farmers are understandably in a thorough
semantic confusion about _long-term_ and
_short-term_. But the truth seems to be that as part
of the ongoing _fiscal restructuring_ under the
aegis of the _IMF_, both the funds and the philosophy
are lacking for any such wasteful thing
as _drought-relief_.

As the cattle go to the slaughter-houses their
owners go to a different kind of a slaughter. (It
was the ancient Indian _rishis_ who first spoke
unblushingly of quadruped cattle and biped
cattle.) They migrate to canal-irrigated areas, if
there are any nearby, to offer their labour cheap
for transplanting and weeding paddy; if there
are none nearby, they migrate to Hyderabad or
farther still to that mother of slums called
Bombay. The horrors of last December and
January that forced as many south Indians as
Muslims to leave that city are mostly forgotten;
anyway those who came back that time and
those who are going now are different people.
That city's employers of cheap immigrant labour
and the Shiv Sena have a different set of prospective
victims now.

The most systematic migration takes place
from Mahbubnagar, a perpetually and very
badly drought-hit district of southern Telangana.
Called Palamur until it was renamed
Mahbubnagar in honour of Nizam-ul-mulk
Mahbub Ali Khan, the migrant labour of the
district is popularly known as Palamur labour.
It is estimated that whether the government
recognises a year as a drought year or not,
about 5 lakh labourers migrate out of the district
nine months in a year to work on project
sites in all corners of the country. They work in
bondage to labour contractors attached to
project construction companies. They are paid
some advance in the village and taken to the
project site to work for the specified duration
--- usually about nine months from the end of
_kharif_ sowing and transplanting till the next
_kharif_ season. Their capacity for hard work and
their pride that the toil of Palamur labour has
created projects in all corners of the country is
matched by their miserable living and working
conditions --- bad food, low wages, wretched
dwellings, exposure to infections, denial of all
legitimate rights of workers and sexual harassment
of women. If the normal migration is five
lakhs a year, the figure gets bloated in years
which are officially recognised as years of
drought.

# DAMAGE BY QUARRYING

Statistical estimates of how much rain water
gets stored in usable form --- underground, in
the tanks or in the soil --- and how much goes
unused do not really deserve the honour unthinkingly
accorded to numerical information
in the prevalent positivist intellectual climate,
but yet the rough estimate that only
about half the rainfall finds its way to use in
our country is revealing. As said earlier,
Telangana has an undulating and rock-studded
terrain marked by numerous big and
small streams. The big streams (called '_vagu_'
in Telugu) have a steady and usually sandy
bed, whereas the small streams (called '_vorre_'
in the idiom peculiar to Telangana) are more
like wild slashes in the earth and have no
proper bed. Irrigation tanks have in the past
been constructed so that they are fed by the
_vagus_ and the _vorres_. And the tanks are
usually part of a system of two to half a dozen
built so that the overflow from those above
feeds through streams into those below. There
is considerable scope for using modern
engineering techniques for improving and
maintaining this system. One does read and
hear about such projects in official documents
and speeches but nothing seems to be getting
done. Though Rayalaseema is worse served in
the matter as it has a relatively flat terrain, what
is really lacking is the intent to ensure that
whatever rain does fall is made available to the
people for drinking and cultivation.

While a positive intent is absent, the unrestricted
process of "development" leads to a
contrary effect. We have already spoken of the
over-exploitation of groundwater through
borewell technology, which has led to even
shortage of drinking water in quite a few villages,
though the drinking water problem is
officially fully solved by the installation of
drinking water bores in a plurality in almost all
villages. And of the conversion of tank beds
into fields, housing colonies and brick kilns.
We will end with another striking example. The
flourishing growth of Hyderabad in the last
decade has led to extensive quarrying of sand
which is most accessibly available in the numerous
streams of neighbouring Nalgonda and
Mahbubnagar districts, streams that feed the
irrigation tanks. Quite a few streams of these
districts located within 100 to 150 kms of the
state's capital city have been emptied of most
of the sand in the bed, leaving the bed hard and
flat. The effect is that when it does rain, the
water that rushes into the stream which would
normally have percolated gently through the
sandy bed and would have partly augmented
the groundwater and partly fed into some tank,
now becomes a flash-flood that breaches tanks
and floods the surroundings. It was the
neighbouring farmers who first noticed that
sand quarrying in streams was resulting in loss
of potential groundwater recharge, and that
their wells were going dry faster than normal
after the sand in streams near their village
started getting carted in lorries to Hyderabad. A
grumbling agitation is in the making in villages
near the affected streams of Nalgonda and
Mahbubnagar districts, which are even otherwise
in the drought belt.

Many such examples --- bigger as well as
more minute can be given to indicate how, in
the absence of a positive policy regarding
rain water conservation, the 'natural' process
of "development works" in a contrary direction
and destroys existing mechanisms of storage,
retention and recharge. All of which is
part of 'drought ' --- whether or not the monsoon
is a failure. Except that when the monsoon
does fail, all the hidden sores get exposed and
take the newsy form of cattle being led to
slaughter, parched fields cracking up, and an
occasional poor man or woman dying of
hunger.
