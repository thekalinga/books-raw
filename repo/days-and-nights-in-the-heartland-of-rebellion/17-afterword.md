# Afterword

I woke up with the moon shining bright on
my face. Through the fifteen day journey
every night we saw the moon grow in size.
From new moon to full moon, a fortnight was
now coming to an end. Tonight would be full
moon. It was 3:30am and I could not sleep.
I sat up. It was the day we were to return. I
felt heavy in my heart. I heard Jan stir next
to me. He asked me if something was
wrong. I said I couldn't sleep. "I feel kind of
low thinking whether I will get to see them
ever again. Will these young women and
men be around? The party members we got
to know and with whom we shared so much
of ourselves, we talked, argued and
discussed, so frankly, will they be around?"
He said, "yes, its been quite remarkable
meeting all of them, and I for one have been
treated as a grandfather, which is
something so strange for someone like me
who comes from Sweden, you know. But
listen, you can still return, whereas I am not
only getting old but I don't think I will be
allowed to return." We sat talking in
whispers. But the feeling did not disappear.
So just when it was time to bid goodbye at
the "border" Niti came to me and said, "_bhai,
mujhe bahut bura lag raha hai ki aap log ja
rahe ho_" (Brother, I feel bad that you all are
leaving today)." I said that is our feeling too.
She said, "_hum yahi baat kar rahe the ki
John sir se kabhi milna nahi hoga. Lekin aap
vapas aayoge na?_" (We were discussing
that we might not meet John Sir ever again,
but you will come again, no?) I told her she
could count on me that I will never give up
trying to somehow make my way back there
to see them. I meant every word. What a
sad day it would be for all of us if these men
and women were to die at the hands of a
force which neither knows nor appreciates
the motivation behind these young people.
What the party means to them, why they
took up arms, what they have achieved, why
they fight and what their dreams are. And
why we must not let them down and protest
the destruction of lives of these people, our
very own.

\[_Acknowledgment_: There are a number of
people who read my draft and shared their
views. Bernard and Sumanto gave detailed
comments, and others briefly such as
Sharmila. Many never got back because
they liked it, or so I believe. I also owe my
colleagues in PUDR and friends in
Perspective a lot for letting me share my
impressions and whose probing questions
helped in organizing my thoughts. To Neha
and Saral my children and Ingrid, my wife,
I owe a lot for believing in me and the
courage they gave me to go through it
without feeling burdened. To all of them my
heartfelt gratitude. But Sahba was with me
throughout, despite our sharp political
differences; the days before, while I was
away when she did not know how I was, and
when I returned waking her up middle of the
night because suddenly something occurred
to me, or I was missing all the comrades I
got to know, or just could not sleep. ...
Needless to add, I alone am responsible for
being "quite supportive" of the Maoists and
for what I have written, as honestly and as
truthfully as I could.\]
