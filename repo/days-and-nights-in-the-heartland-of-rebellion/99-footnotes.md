# Afterword

I woke up with the moon shining bright on
my face. Through the fifteen day journey
every night we saw the moon grow in size.
From new moon to full moon, a fortnight was
now coming to an end. Tonight would be full
moon. It was 3.30 a.m and I could not sleep.
I sat up. It was the day we were to return. I
felt heavy in my heart. I heard Jan stir next
to me. He asked me if something was
wrong. I said I couldnʼt sleep. “I feel kind of
low thinking whether I will get to see them
ever again. Will these young women and
men be around? The party members we got
to know and with whom we shared so much
of ourselves, we talked, argued and
discussed, so frankly, will they be around?”
He said, “yes, its been quite remarkable
meeting all of them, and I for one have been
treated as a grandfather, which is
something so strange for someone like me
who comes from Sweden, you know. But
listen, you can still return, whereas I am not
only getting old but I donʼt think I will be
allowed to return.” We sat talking in
whispers. But the feeling did not disappear.
So just when it was time to bid goodbye at
the “border” Niti came to me and said, “bhai,
mujhe bahut bura lag raha hai ki aap log ja
rahe ho” (Brother, I feel bad that you all are
leaving today).” I said that is our feeling too.
She said, “hum yahi baat kar rahe the ki
John sir se kabhi milna nahi hoga. Lekin aap
vapas aayoge na?” (We were discussing
that we might not meet John Sir ever again,
but you will come again, no?) I told her she
could count on me that I will never give up
trying to somehow make my way back there
to see them. I meant every word. What a
sad day it would be for all of us if these men
and women were to die at the hands of a
force which neither knows nor appreciates
the motivation behind these young people.
What the party means to them, why they
took up arms, what they have achieved, why
they fight and what their dreams are. And
why we must not let them down and protest
the destruction of lives of these people, our
very own.

[_Acknowledgment_: There are a number of
people who read my draft and shared their
views. Bernard and Sumanto gave detailed
comments, and others briefly such as
Sharmila. Many never got back because
they liked it, or so I believe. I also owe my
colleagues in PUDR and friends in
Perspective a lot for letting me share my
impressions and whose probing questions
helped in organizing my thoughts. To Neha
and Saral my children and Ingrid, my exwife, I owe a lot for believing in me and the
courage they gave me to go through it
without feeling burdened. To all of them my
heartfelt gratitude. But Sahba was with me
throughout, despite our sharp political
differences; the days before, while I was
away when she did not know how I was, and
when I returned waking her up middle of the
night because suddenly something occurred
to me, or I was missing all the comrades I
got to know, or just could not sleep….
Needless to add, I alone am responsible for
being “quite supportive” of the Maoists and
for what I have written, as honestly and as
truthfully as I could.]

Notes:
1. Security forces possess light mortars,
   machine guns, rocket launchers, INSAS
   rifles, FN 35 and Glock pistols, Hecker and
   Koch MP 5 machine guns and Carl Gustav
   Reconaissance Recoilless rifles. Besides,
   they have air force providing helicopters for
   ferrying troops in and out of the combat
   zone, aerial surveillance. Maoists claim they
   possess INSAS rifles, AK 47s, self-loading
   rifles and cache of explosives. [The
   Hindustan Times 10th October, 2009.]
2. The war against Naxals and Maoists has
   a long history of bloodletting. For instance
   police sources themselves admit that
   between March 1970 and August 1971 in
   Kolkata and its suburbs 1,783 CPI(ML)
   supporters were killed. On August 21, 1971,
   in Baranagar near Kolkata, 1,000 young
   people may have been slaughtered in a
   single locality. Escape routes were blocked
   and police guarded every lane. By 1973,
   more than 32,000 CPI (ML) leaders, activists
   and supporters were jailed. In West Bengal
   alone there were 17,787 prisoners of which
   12,016 were young and 1,399 below 18
   years. Such was the phobia that 20
   incidents of firing on unarmed Naxalites
   inside jails took place between 1970-72. The
   killing of eight prisoners and injuries to 60 of
   them in Midnapore Central jail on 17
   December 1970 and the 21 February, 1971
   violence in Berhampore jail where 10
   inmates died and 62 were injured, were
   some of the worst instances. [source: Low
   Intensity Conflict, CPI (Maoist) for internal
   circulation, year and place of publication not
   known]
3. “It is very clear that the anti-Naxal
   operations are being carried out in those
   districts (East Singhbhum, West Singbhum,
   Khunti, Gumla, Bokaro, Giridih, Chatra,
   Latehar, Ramgarh and Hazaribagh) where
   the villagers are opposing the proposed
   projects for steel plants, mining industries,
   power projects, dams and sponge iron
   factories…. Therefore, we have every
   reason to believe that the so-called
   operation green hunt or anti-Naxal operation
   is to get the Adivasis and other local settlers
   lands clear for the corporate houses rather
   than cleansing the Maoists from the areas. It
   seems that the state is essentially batting for
   the corporate houses in the name of the
   Maoists and instead of creating peace the
   government is creating insecurity in the
   state.” [From open letter sent by Jharkhand
   Indigenous Peopleʼs Forum, dated
   19/03/2010, to the Union Home Minister P
   Chidambaram. The letter is available at
   http://www.sacw.net/article1377.html]
4. To be referred to in a chargesheet against
   Kobad Gandhy, filed by Special Cell of Delhi
   Police (in FIR No 58/09, dated 20.09.2009)
   on 18.02.2010 in the court of Ms Kaveri
   Baweja, Tis Hazari, Delhi is not the nicest
   experience of life. Yet, the reference is
   neither unflattering nor inaccurate. It is the
   intent they attach to it, or rather what the
   officials perceive to be wrong, unlawful….
   thatʼs the issue. It is not my intent, it is the
   intent officials attribute which makes evident
   the obnoxious nature of UAPA. The chargesheet says “Mr Gautam Naulakha (canʼt the
   MHA ensure that peopleʼs names are not
   mis-spelt given the many years of
   surveillance) of PUDR is quite supportive to
   their outfit CPI (Maoist) and he (Kobad
   Gandhy) met him many times in Delhi and
   Mumbai prior to his arrest in the present
   case. He also met him in Tihar Jail, Delhi”.
   (pp 15) [Emphasis added]. The exact
   implication of “quiet supportive” and “met
   him many times” arises only because it is
   considered ʻunlawfulʼ. In other words once
   you proscribe a political party, and prevent
   its ideology from being propagated or
   promoted, as well as declare as unlawful
   and terrorist the organization and its
   members, then you criminalize what is
   normal and legitimate. If the law says that
   meeting, holding a meeting even between
   three persons belonging to a proscribed
   organization is ʻunlawfulʼ, then they are
   justified in taking away a personʼs freedom.
   Membership of a proscribed organization is
   a crime (UAPA Thus hobnobbing with
   members of proscribed organization is
   unlawful too. These provisions are
   accompanied by procedures and rules which
   enhance the power of the police and
   prosecutor at the expense of the accused.
   And simultaneously relaxes the exacting
   standards for collecting, collating and use of
   evidence.
5. Let me cite two instances: On February 8,
   2010 the Supreme Court ordered vis-a-vis
   Writ Petition (Criminal) No 103 of 2009 that
   12 disappeared adivasis including Sodi
   Sambho be produced before it on February
   15th, 2010. The case related to victims and
   witnesses to a massacre at Gompad village
   on October 1, 2009. Since January 2010
   Sodi Sambho had gone missing. When on
   order of the apex court she was brought to
   Delhi by the Chattisgarh police for treatment
   no one was allowed to meet her not even
   her lawyer. By the time the court ordered
   that her lawyer be allowed to meet her
   without the police being present she had
   once again gone missing. In response to this
   on 29th January, 2010 the court ordered that
   she, along with other 11 adivasis, be
   brought back to Delhi by 15th February,
2010. However, on February 9th the apex
      court was informed that in pursuance of its
      order on the evening of February 8th a team
      of 300 police guided by Hari Ram a SPO left
      on foot for Gachchanpalli to fetch seven of
      the twelve adivasis.. The police team
      reached at 5 a.m. of 9th February the village
      of Gurkha, on way to Gachchanpalli, where
      they first met with a landmine explosion in
      which SPO Hari Ram lost both his legs and
      another police personnel got injured.
      Thereupon the police team came under
      firing of the Maoists. The fax produced
      before the apex court also said that
      Gachhanpalli was a Naxal hotbed. Since
      neither media nor social activists are being
      permitted to enter the ʻwar zoneʼ there was
      no independent confirmation of the story.
      However, a fact finding team by
      Coordination of Democratic Rights
      Organisation (which among others
      comprised APCLC, HRF, PDF, PUDR,
      CPCL, NPMHR etc) found that DGP of
      Chattisgarh who claimed that two SPOs
      were killed on 9th of February was being
      less than truthful. The team visited Gompad
      village on 13th February, 2010 and villagers
      stated that no such incident had taken place.
      Instead on 10th February SPOs and a police
      party attacked the village of Ganchampalli,
      near Gompad, and picked up 10 of the
      villagers and took them to the Dornapal
      Base Camp. Village head Pudiam
      Lakshmaiah told the team that Kadithi
      Muthaiah (35), Kadithi Venkaiah (25),
      Kunjam Veeraiah (35), Kunjam Chilakaiah
      (32), Parisi Venkaiah (25), Parisi Veeraiah
      (20), Vanjam Dharma (34), Madivi Edima
      (32), Povasi Edima (30) and Sodi Podiya
      (45) were forcibly taken by the SPO and
      police and they had not heard anything
      since then. Thus it is evident that
      Chattisgarh authorities in connivance with
      Union Home Ministry and its various
      agencies will go to any length to thwart
      efforts to bring out the truth.
      This is not all. On 6th January, 2010 a team
      of social activists were accosted by
      members of Maa Danteshawri Swabhiman
      Manch and prevented from participating in a
      padyatra called by Himanshuji of Vanvasi
      Chetna Ashram in Dantewada. The same
      members of this organization had attacked
      VCA and also abused and hurled eggs and
      stones at social activists. All of this was
      dutifully broadcast by a malleable media as
      a manifestation of adivasi anger against the
      supposed pro-Maoist proclivity of the social
      activists. The fact that 6th January attack on
      social activists was led by Soyam Mukka an
      absconder in a case of gang rape of adivasi
      girl in March 2008 (case No 84/09 of 2009 )
      by the Judicial Magistrate First Class in
      Konta and that all this took place in full view
      of Chattisgarh police, one which claimed
      that they were unable to trace any of the
      eight alleged rapists, makes the role of the
      state government, police administration and
      union home ministry suspect. What is also
      obvious that institutions of State and its
      agencies and the corporate media would
      much rather patronize alleged rapists and
      killers and looters than allow truth to become
      public.
      It is this deliberate attempt to silence all
      voices and not allow any independent views
      to filter out of the war zone and on the other
      hand patronage given to alleged rapists,
      killers and looters that makes this ʻdirty warʼ,
      nay “police action”, so life threatening as far
      as constitutional democracy is concerned.

   out its own called ʻViyukkaʼ, its military
   command ʻPadiyora Polloʼ, Chetna Natya
   Manch ʻJhankarʼ etc. groups practicing
   singing was also a common sight.
7. The Jamui massacre involved the killing,
   allegedly by the CPI (Maoist), of 12 tribals
   including women and children and wounding
   of 50 others on 17 February in Phulwaria
   and Korasi villages of Jamui district of Bihar.
   The massacre is reported to be in retaliation
   for the killing of eight Maoist cadres on 1
   February, who were allegedly taken into
   custody and then killed by the police.
8. On November 20, 2009, eight bogies of
   the Tata-Bilaspur passenger train were
   derailed near the Manoharpur railway station
   in West Singhbhum district of Jharkhand by
   the armed cadres of CPI (Maoist) in which
   two persons, including a two year old, died
   and 51 were injured. The derailment,
   allegedly using detonators, was caused in
   the course of a two day bandh from
   November 19-20 when, according to local
   Maoist leaders, they were demanding that
   one of their arrested leaders be produced in
   Court. According to Samarji, secretary
   Bihar-Jharkahnd-Orissa regional committee
   of the CPI(Maoist), the “mistake” occurred
   because of “overzealous new recruits.”
9. There are now an estimated 75 million
   firearms in South Asia, 63 million of which
   are in civilian hands. India and Pakistan
   account for most of the weapons (40 million
   and 20 million respectively) where there is
   local production as well, while civilians in
   Nepal and Sri Lanka own an additional 3
   million weapons. Civilians are the largest
   category of gun owners in the region,
   accounting for far more weapons than the
   military, police and insurgents. See
   International Action Network on Small Arms
   www.iansa.org/regions/scasia/scasia.htm
10. A must read is Utsa Patnaikʼs discussion
    piece “A Critical Look At Some Propositions
    on Consumption and Poverty”; Economic
    and Political Weekly, Vol 45, No. 6,
    February 6, 2010. Also consider what
    national vice-president of Peopleʼs Union for
    Civil Liberties (PUCL) Dr Binayak Sen had to
    say at the sixth I G Khan Memorial Lecture
    on ʻViolence and Justice in Our Timesʼ at
    Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) on
    Saturday (13th March 2010). He said that
    the action against Maoists is only
    accentuating the problem of malnutrition in
    tribal areas. According to him, malnutrition
    should be the most pressing concern of the
    government. A person with a body mass
    index of less than 18.5 is malnourished.
    According to National Nutrition Monitoring
    Bureau, 33 per cent of adult Indians have a
    BMI of less than 18.5. If you disaggregate
    this, over 50 per cent of Scheduled Tribes
    have a BMI of 18.5 or are undernourished.
    “The WHO says that any community of
    which over 40 per cent population has a BMI
    of 18.5 per cent is in a state of famine. By
    that standard, many communities in India
    are living in a state of famine. Orissa, whose
    40 per cent population is undernourished,
    too, fits the bill.”
    Military campaign against Maoists and
    displacement of tribals, he underlined, would
    only make things worse. “The government is
    displacing a large number of people from the
    very resource base that they are surviving
    on. Use of words like collateral damage by
    the government is dangerous as the Maoists
    donʼt carry a label on their head.”
11. The statement reads: “Since the transfer
    of power in 1947, there has not been a
    single year when the Indian government has
    not fought against our people, starting with
    suppression of Telengana uprising (1946-
51) followed by war against Jammu and
    Kashmir, Naga people, against people of
    Manipur, Assam, etc. Fact findings by Civil
    Liberties – Democratic Rights groups,
    including PUDR, have brought out the fact
    that such wars/armed conflicts are
    intrinsically ʻdirty warʼ where casualties
    occur in form of encounters, custodial
    killings, enforced disappearances, mortar
    shelling, search and cordon operations,
    arbitrary detentions, torture, and rape.
    The new war, we fear, in its scale and
    spread of the war against the
    Naxalites/Maoists will cover predominately
    nine states. The fact that the war zone
    covers primarily tribal areas of ʻheartlandʼ
    India, which is mineral rich and where the
    specter of land grab, displacement from
    forests, privatization of water resources and
    attack on peopleʼs sources of livelihood
    looms large, makes this war particularly
    gruesome. We are convinced that this war is
    nothing short of an attempt at weakening the
    formidable resistance offered by our people
    against Government of Indiaʼs neo-liberal
    policy. The resistance comprises struggles
    not only led by Maoists/Naxalites (from
    CPI(ML) New Democracy to CPI(ML)
    Liberation), other organisations like PSBJC
    of West Bengal, CMAS of Narayanpatna,
    workersʼ movement in Gorakhpur, dalit
    landless agricultural workers led by All India
    Kisan Mazdoor Sabha in rural districts
    around Allahabad (UP), the NBA and other
    constituents of NAPM led struggles,
    Kalinganagar struggle spearheaded by CPI
    amongst several other. Contribution of this
    plurality of struggles, different in nature and
    even intent, is what has sustained the
    resistance.
    We the undersigned are convinced that
    singling out Naxalites/Maoists is precisely
    because they have offered the most
    stubborn resistance against neo-liberal
    policies of the Indian government, and which
    has acted as a fillip for the overall resistance
    being offered by other groups and parties.
    The collective resistance has thwarted so far
    Indian and foreign corporations from
    implementing more than hundred MOUs in
    Chattisgarh, Orissa, Jharkhand etc. This
    war, we believe, is precisely to enable
    corporations to enforce the secret MOUs
    which they have signed with the various
    state governments. We support all forms of
    resistance against this savage war for
    corporate development unleashed by the
    state against our own people.
    However, we urge all warring parties to
    declare their unequivocal adherence to
    Geneva Convention and other international
    laws in order to ensure that civilians/noncombatants are not harmed.
    We believe, that ethics of war, as enshrined
    in Article 3, common to the four Geneva
    Convention of 1949, enjoins on the parties,
    even to an internal conflict, to respect some
    basic principles of humanitarian behavior
    during war/armed conflict, and it is binding
    not just on governments but also on the
    insurgents/rebels/revolutionaries. Moreover,
    additional Protocol II of 1977 of Geneva
    Convention supplements Article 3 with few
    specific provisions where wars take place
    within a country.
    We wish to point out that issues of legality,
    reciprocity or applicability of the ethical
    principles underlying Geneva Conventions
    and Protocol II cannot be made an excuse
    to deny that these principles, which govern
    war/armed conflict, can be complied with
    and implemented, by all warring sides in so
    far as their own combat personnel are
    concerned.”
