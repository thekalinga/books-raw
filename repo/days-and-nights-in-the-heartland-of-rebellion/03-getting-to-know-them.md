# Getting to Know Them

For the first few days, people were shy to
speak because they could not place me.
Was I Indian? If so, how could I converse
with Jan Myrdal in his language? Also, they
were not too fluent in Hindi, and were not
sure whether I understood Chhattisgarhi,
which they were more familiar with and
knew that I did not know Gondi or Koyam.
But after the first few days, curiosity got the
better of them and they began to converse.
When they found that I could speak and
write Hindi, and that I was an Indian who
had lived abroad but now lived in Delhi, they
could begin to place me. It became distinctly
easier when we began to sing together.
They asked me questions about how people
lived in Delhi. Did people have work? How
much did they earn? How did they live? Why
did revolution not succeed in Europe when
Marx and Engels lived and worked there? Is
there no class struggle there? Why do
Taliban and other Jehadis bomb mosques
and target their own people and not the US
military? How come Kashmiris do not have
one party fighting for their liberation? Each
question needed answers, which could not
be perfunctory. I learnt and unlearnt. Thirty
years of the movement had made them
aware of the world outside their forests.
They knew that people are fighting to free
themselves of oppression in Palestine, Iraq,
Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Kashmir, Nagaland,
Manipur, and Assam. Despite being
geographically restricted, their minds were
not warped. I was once again reminded of
what I discovered as a student that people
who struggle are sensitive. But more
importantly the difference between those
who speak, like Palestinians, Lebanon's
Hizbullah, Latin Americans or South
Africans, a universal language and,
therefore, they could relate to other
struggles, unlike those with narrower vision
who could not care less about people's
struggles elsewhere or markedly different
from theirs. But it struck me also that the
globalizing Indian intelligentsia is, ironically,
more parochial and less cosmopolitan than
the Indian forest dwellers living under
Janatana _Sarkar_. They who live in jungles
could empathise with people's struggles
elsewhere in contrast to the urban
intelligentsia who, despite having access to
information, either knows not or could not be
bothered less.

I came across three arguments about the
spurt in struggle in Bastar in recent times,
talking to _adivasi_ peasants inside as well as
in areas adjoining the guerilla zone. Firstly,
that the war launched by the government
was being waged on behalf of the big
corporations to grab _adivasi_ land. They, the
_adivasi_ peasants, are being warned that if
they do not give their consent and take the
compensation being offered, they will not
only lose their land, but in addition they
might never receive compensation in their
hands. (_Adivasi_ Mahasbaha, led by the CPI,
is reported to be persuading people to settle
for higher compensation.) I was intrigued
when I heard this from several persons, so I
began to inquire what was meant. What
does it mean that they might not receive
compensation. I was told that "agents" of the
company were warning them, that if they do
not accept the "offer" their money will go to
others. It was then explained that incidents
of fraudulent cheques that bounced or
cheques issued to persons other than
landowners has been a quite frequent
occurrence. Second, a common refrain was
that the monetary compensation being
offered to them was unfair value for a land
which has not only sustained them all this
while, but is their only guarantee to secure
the livelihoods of their descendants.
Besides, it was pointed out that it is not just
land but trees such as the "sulfi", mango,
tamarind and so forth also nourish them and
fetch them earnings. Third, "vikas"
(development) which the government talks
of is "bunkum" (nonsense) having seen what
was done in Bailadilla. For all these years,
tribals have fended for themselves receiving
paltry help from the government and now,
when corporations want their land,
government talks of "development". They
want the government to let them be. One old
_adivasi_ peasant said that if "they are so keen
to bring 'development' to us what stopped
them all these years, or stops them now
from developing agriculture?"

At a meeting inside the jungle, when we
were speaking to some elderly people they
said something that stuck with us. "We are
old and have lived our life, so even if I have
to offer my life to stop the government from
taking away our land, I will do it because I
must ensure that our children do not have to
leave this land." "All of us", he said pointing
to others of his generation, "are going to
stay put and fight. Let us see how many of
us will be killed by the military. Do they think
they can kill all of us? We know how to
fight". The anger was visible. I asked what I
should tell the people outside. "Please tell
them their _sarkar_ is lying to them. Today
they take away my land and forest tomorrow
they will take away my life. This forest and
land is our life".

I read out what Home Minister P
Chidambaram told Tehelka:

>\[I\]n my mind I am completely
convinced that no country can
develop unless it uses its natural
resources and human resources.
Mineral wealth is wealth that must be
harvested and used for the people.
And why not? Do you want the tribals
to remain hunters and gatherers? Are
we trying to preserve them in some
sort of anthropological museum? Yes,
we can allow the minerals to remain
in the ground for another 10,000
years, but will that bring development
to these people? We can respect the
fact that they worship the Niyamgirhi
hill, but will that put shoes on their
feet or their children in school? Will
that solve the fact they are severely
malnutritioned. And have no access to
health care? The debate about mining
has gone on for centuries. It is
nothing new."

But we are not the ones who are starving
here, they said. But what about those
outside, I asked. "They too can benefit if JS
is allowed to reach them." So you do not
want development, I persisted. "No we do
not want these big capitalists from outside to
loot us. We know what happened in
Bailadilla." This was the key word and catch
phrase, 'look what they did in Bailadila'. (see
Gautam Navlakha and Asish Gupta, "The
Real Divide in Bastar"; EPW Vol XLIV No
30, August 15, 2009).
