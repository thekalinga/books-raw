# How Does it Work

However, it is one thing to create a political
structure but quite another to find out how it
actually operates. I was told that elections to
RPCs are held every three years. And those
RPCs select members for ARPCs. I knew
also that on an average up to 15 RPCs
constitute ARPC. RPC holds a general body
meeting where accounts are shared and
reviewed. Similarly ARPC accounts are
discussed in extended meetings of all the
RPCs which come under it. In both RPC and
ARPC members have right to recall any
office bearer if he or she is found wanting in
any respect. But I wanted to know what an
ARPC budget looked like. The area where
we were, there were 14 RPCs, each RPC
had roughly 160 households thus in the
ARPC there were approximately 3000 +
households. There were 15 members in the
ARPC. Niti a woman comrade was the
division committee member in charge of the
Janatam _Sarkar_. Shivnath was the president
of the ARPC and Balmati its vice president.
Head of the finance department was
Naresh, while Sushila was head of the PR
department and member of party area
committee. Each ARPC has a standing
committee where the president, vice
president, finance department head as well
as defense department head are members. I
asked to see the budget for 2009. This is
what it looked like:

On the income side it showed Rs. 10 lakh
and one thousand. This was made up of Rs.
3,60,000 tax on contractors, Rs. 500,000
allotted by Jantam _Sarkar_ and ₹250,000
collected through work days or shram daan
by the area households. On the expenditure
side the budget showed that they spent ₹506,935
towards defence, ₹140,250 for
agriculture, ₹100,000 for health, ₹10,000
for education, ₹60,000 for trade
and ₹5000 for public relations. Why the
expenditure on defense was high and
education pittance, I asked? Niti explained
that since 2004 when decision was taken to
shift the responsibility for PLGA and
people's militia on JS the expenditure
incurred for kit (three pair of uniform, oil,
soap, toothpaste, washing soap, comb,
gunpowder, bows and arrows, and food)
was borne by the ARPC. As for low
expenditure on education Shivnath said that
it was only because they had not been able
to find a "_guruji_" for the schools run by the
JS. As party cadres filled in the role they did
not have to spend money on paying salary
or more than what was needed to run the
evening schools. I asked them if I could be
shown details of how the money was spent
on agriculture. The expenditure comprised
money spent on fishery, plants, seeds,
papaya, lemon, mango and guava. Some
were items purchased from the individual
farmers and distributed among those who
needed it. However, fishery and seeds and
plants were meant for development of
pisiculture (this ARPC had four ponds for
fishery and 7 wells) and providing seeds to
poor peasants who could not afford to buy
them or those who for some reason needed
help. Similarly trade was to purchase forest
products for re-sale. The ARPC has a justice
department also.

What cases generally are referred to them?
Land disputes say between family members
especially between brothers. Earlier practise
was that elder brother got a bigger share
than the younger ones. Also women got less
than men. Not anymore. RPCs go by
principle of equality. They also intercede on
matters of superstition.

One of the most difficult cases was the case
of murder of three traders from L who had
gone to T to purchase goats. They had
between them ₹20,000. First the missing
case was referred to in the local police
station. When they failed to do anything the
family of the missing traders approached the
RPC. Their remains were found after three
months. The justice department after
investigation discovered that they were
robbed and killed while the story spread
claimed that wild animals probably had got
them. The people accused of the crime were
brought before a peoples court where 1500
people came along with 115 of victims
family. The victim's family wanted to kill the
accused. After much to and from they
settled for 60 bullocks, 40 goats, 15 pigs, 20
chicken, 10 _kandi_ of rice (each _kandi_ equals
30 kgs). However, finally the matter was
settled by making the accused pay ₹80,000,
bones of the dead was handed over
to the family of the victims and proper burial
undertaken. I asked why such leniency was
shown to the accused. I was told that ₹80,000
was a huge amount in the forest
area and that even this amount was in
inverse proportion to the class of peasant.
Thus the rich peasant had to pay ₹20,000,
middle 15,000 and poor 10,000. Besides,
they said that JS Constitution does not
follow death for death, as matter of principle.

Article 5(h) says that

>(t)he people's courts
will work as per the principles of just
judiciary process and system on the basis of
class line and mass line. The judicial
department will solve the problems between
the people so as to enhance their integrity.
Normally it does not punish to solve them.
When it tries landlords, hierarchs, heads of
the ruling class parties, wicked government
officers, police, paramilitary, military forces,
police agents, conspirators, disrupters,
deceivers, goons, thieves, anarchists and
other such elements, it isolates them from
the people and punishes them accordingly
including confiscation of their properties. It
follows methods to increase the role of
people in avoiding crimes. It gives death
sentence to those who indulge in counter
revolutionary crimes. Before it implements
death sentence the local people's
government have to obtain permission from
the higher courts. Except for counter
revolutionary crimes, it will send those
indulged in murder, attempt to murder,
atrocities on women, informing the exploiting
police and other such things to the labor
camps. In these camps, they are made to do
labor. They are taught revolutionary politics
and are reformed. It will help to develop the
people's judicial system by passing verdict
on disputes, crimes and conspiracies. It will
also keep in view the customary traditions
while giving verdict. (Emphasis added)

And 5(I) says that

>(I)n each and every case
there must be voting among the judges and
verdict must be given according to the
opinion of the majority. It may be given with
slight majority also. But in critical cases the
verdicts must have ⅔^rd^ majorities. The
president of the judicial departmental
committee or the judge who presides the
trial shall announce the verdicts. They must
give the necessary explanation.

Thus contrary to critics who believe that
Maoists kill at the drop of a hat capital
punishment is reserved only for "counter-revolutionary
crimes" and outlawed for rest.
What is meant by "counter-revolutionary
crimes"? From what I gathered it is a
heinous crime such as enabling security
forces to carry out an ambush that results in
loss of lives which can invite capital
punishment. It is not awarded for every
informer, or even homicide. I was repeatedly
told that death penalty is rare and is
preceded by several warnings to the person.
Even then, at least what the constitution
obliges them to do, is not to carry out the
sentence unless it is ratified by the higher
instance, going all the way up to the state or
zonal JS. This is to ensure that there is
some check and balance against abuse of
authority.
