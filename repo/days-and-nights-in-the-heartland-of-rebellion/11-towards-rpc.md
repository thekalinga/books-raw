# Towards RPC

In 2001, at the 9th Party congress a
conceptual development was reached in the
party about base areas and building the
people's army. After a thorough review, the
decision was taken to build guerilla bases. In
the words of Sonu: "Since 2001, the first
base area construction had to be analysed
in more concrete terms. This was discussed
and debated thoroughly. Accordingly within
the guerilla zones, guerilla bases began to
be built. Therefore, concrete shape was now
finally being given to the construction of
people's power in accordance with the
terrain and available support of mass base.
500 to 3000 people in the villages were now
being constituted into Revolutionary
People's Committees (RPCs). The
understanding was that without army people
cannot built power. People's army and
people's power were linked. This developed
understanding helped us a lot in working
towards both the development of the army
and the development of people's power.
Two or three spots were selected for guerilla
bases in each division, and in this shape 1012
spots were concentrated upon to form
the guerilla bases. Maad forms the Central
Guerilla Base."

Difference between Guerilla zone and
guerilla base is not semantic it is, Maoists
claim, of substance. Guerilla zone is a fluid
area in the sense that there is contention for
control and the State is not entirely absent,
even if it be in shape of its police or armed
force. However, there are spots in these
guerilla zones which are demarcated to
ensure that some work can carry on
relatively uninterrupted. These are "bases"
which are not easily penetrable or
accessible. It is here RPC function and one
can see the liberated zone in its embryonic
form.

The first step was to create village level
RPC which comprised up to 15 villages. The
second step was to create ARPC over the
selected guerilla bases in each division
comprising 3--5 RPCs. Thus by December
2004, the first ARPC was built. And by
February 2005, the 2nd ARPC was formed.
From 2005 onwards, till 2008 all the spots
were covered by ARPC. The party decision
was to create minimum 3 ARPCs in each
division, which is currently under process.
The first divisional government was formed
in 2007 March. During the initial stage of
guerilla bases, the corresponding military
formation was platoons. Now with the
development of divisional _sarkar_, companies
were formed at military level. To intensify
this process, they have made Zonal Level
_Sarkar_ Preparatory Committee. Once this is
made, the zonal level _sarkar_ will be in place,
and alongside, in terms of military
development, battalions are being built. The
first battalion was formed on August 10, 2009.

At the village level, for the JS, there is adult
franchise. After that at higher levels, there is
selection. This means, that it is elected
RPCs which select members to ARPC. And
the same process goes up to the Zonal level
council. Considering that DK area was
predominantly inhabited by _adivasi_ people
with limited experience in new governance,
the first workshop for this purpose was
organised in February 2008. According to
Sonu it was an extremely productive
endeavor as a free exchange of experience
and opinion took place for both the party as
well as the people. On the other side, as the
higher level of people's government was
being formed the call for boycott of
parliamentary election was now being
actively undertaken. In the 2008 November,
Chattisgarh Assembly Election, as in the
2009 April, 15th Lok Sabha Election and in
the 2009 October Maharashtra Assembly
Election, it was the JS which took the
initiative of active and collective boycott of
election by the people. All the RPCs called
public meetings in their villages and told the
people that they have been electing their
own government, how can they elect
another government outside of themselves
at the same time?

Along side the people's militia has also
evolved with the purpose of protecting the
people's government. The military strength
has also been increasing and consequently
the para military forces which during every
election try to pressurise and threaten the
masses, according to the party, have been
effectively resisted by the PLGA and the
militia lately. In the entire struggle area or
the guerilla zone there are only been 2--5%
polling. For instance, in Gogonda, there
were 700 voters and 1000 para military
posted during election. Despite elaborate
arrangements there were only 10 votes cast,
that too after 3rd repolling.

In terms of recruitment too, PLGA has been
holding recruitment campaign from 2001.
Difference is that after 2005, the duty of
recruitment has been handed over to the
RPCs. Now responsibility for the people's
army rests with the people's government,
JS. RPCs encourage people to join the
people's army. We were told, for instance,
that in 2008 December, in Gangalur the
ARPCs of the area conducted two public
meetings at two different places attended by
more than 10 thousand people. From the
Dias itself, the ARPC president gave a call
for recruitment into the PLGA. From these
two public meetings 107 youth volunteered
to join the PLGA and the party after
screening them recruited 65 members from
here.

All developments in this region of DK is now
the responsibility of the people's
government, i.e., the JS. The established
administration is being replaced by the
strengthening of the people's government.
The RPCs originally had 7 departments later
two more departments in the form of trade
and industry and public relations have been
added. In order to ensure women's
participation in people's government the
goal is to secure 50% share for women in
governance. When asked, if this goal has
been met we were told that they are still
working in this area and as of now there has
not been much progress possible. So what
is the percentage of women in responsible
posts in JS? It was said that it is around
40%. One of the problems which being
encountered is that unlike party or PLGA
which is full time work and involves traveling
JS means a more sedentary job and families
and household chores remain. Unless there
is sharing of these chores women find it
difficult to take on administrative
responsibilities. The work load too has
increased for JS. For instance they run
mobile schools and mobile health care units.

What was interesting was to get to know
how JS was trying to get around the problem
of lack of hospitals and trained doctors. So
what do they do? I was told that doctors who
are there working in DK's guerilla zones
conduct work shops where elementary
training is provided to members of RPCs.
Since malaria, cholera and elephantitis are
the three most dreaded illness which afflicts
people, their symptoms are taught and
medicines identified by their colours. In
order that, some treatment is offered to
people who are unwell. What if these
"barefoot" doctors mix up medicines? Well
there is no hundred % guarantee that
this does not occur. But all we can ensure is
that incidence of this nature through
workshops or by sending a team (a couple
of them) this is brought down.

In so far as mobile schools are concerned
these are in nature of camps where children
attend schools for anywhere between 15 to
30 days, depending upon how tense the
situation is in a particular area. Classes last
for 90 minutes for each subject with four
subjects taught in a day. There are between
25--30 students and three teachers. They
have begun to employ certain teaching aids
from globe, torch-lights to CDs to teach
history and science. In science they find that
they encounter problem because people's
beliefs about evolution, universe, sun and
moon etc are different from what science
teaches us. But children are taught through
teaching aids or CDs the way life evolved,
eclipses occur etc. Significantly, JS
education tries to meet the challenge posed
to them to teach, for e.g., modern science by
picking on everyday things around them and
maximizing use of resources which they
have access to. Reminded me of work done
by Kishore Bharati in MP.
