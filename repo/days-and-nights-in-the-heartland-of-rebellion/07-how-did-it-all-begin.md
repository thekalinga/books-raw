# How Did It All Begin?

Every encounter and everything I read,
heard or observed only ignited my desire to
know how the movement took roots here,
because only then can we understand what
has been achieved in 30 years. Since 2004,
the party has expanded beyond DK, which
comprised old Bastar (comprising five
districts of Chattisgarh) and Gadchiroli
(Maharshtra) into Manpur and Mainpur,
which are non-forested largely plain areas.
For administrative reason, the area where
the party is working has been divided into
ten divisions: the Bastar area (comprising
the five districts of Bastar, Kanker, Bijapur,
Dantewada and Jagdalpur) has been
divided into six divisions, while Gadchiroli is
divided into two divisions. These along with
Manpur and Mainpur, form the ten divisions.
In the entire DK area, the Koya and Dorla
tribes are the predominant _adivasi_
communities. Other tribes include Halbi,
Batra and the Pradhan. There are some dalit
sections as well as the Mahar community of
Maharashtra who also live in sizable
numbers in this area. Other than this there
are some non-_adivasi_ communities like
Sahu. The Koya and Dorla communities are
together referred to as Gonds and therefore,
the name Gondvana. The total Gond
population covering parts of state of Madhya
Pradesh, Chattishgarh, Maharashtra,
Andhra Pradesh and Orissa number
approximately seven million. The movement
is spread over approximately sixty thousand
square kilometers and where the party
exercises control in the eight divisions of
DK, it covers a population of approximately
four-and-a-half to five million. A senior
leader Sonu told us that throughout its
history, the people of this area have fought
against exploitation and for their land and
livelihood. They have had a relatively
democratic living in accordance with the
tribal tradition than what prevailed in rest of
India. They have never submitted to
oppression but fought against it. In fact, from
1825 to 1964, there have been ten to eleven
recorded uprisings under various tribal
leaders. Approximately 16 years before the
party entered this area, in 1964, the people
of Bastar rose against the then Congress led
government, under their Raja. "After a lull of
15 years, we entered this area in 1980", he
said. Two squads of People's War (PW)
members entered DK in 1980. That was how
it began.

Murali was a member of the first squad to
enter DK in 1980. According to him, "after
the setback of _Naxalbari_, in 1978,
Karimnagar and Adilabad peasant
movement was started in Andhra Pradesh.
In 1977, the Party had decided to organise
'Go to Village Campaign'. Accordingly, in
1978, in Telangana, coastal areas of AP,
youth and students from APRSU and RYL
along with Party Professionals organised
political schools for 10 days to prepare for
'Go to Village Campaign'. At the village
level, a democratic revolution against
feudalism was the agenda and appeals were
made to the villagers through pamphlets,
posters and rallies." The task carried out
was a class analysis of the area. It became
evident that in Gadchiroli, "there was not
that much exploitation from money lenders,
but it came from the forest department.
Along side, there were other contradictions,
but the primary one was that between the
state and people. In Bastar, there was land
problem. Here, there was contradiction
between the people as well as of forest
dwellers with the forest department. There
was lesser exploitation than Adilabad in
Andhra Pradesh. Although tribals were
divided into classes, yet contradictions here
were not as sharp as in the plains of
Telangana. There was a class society here,
but due to the tribal traditions, unlike plains
the _Mukhia_/Manjis exploitation did not
appear sharp". What about the language
barrier? In the areas where they first entered
Telugu was understood and spoken, both in
Bastar as well as Gadchiroli sides. However,
as part of _Naxalbari_ movement learning to
speak the language of the people, learning
Gondi, for example, became a priority. It
took some doing to learn the language but
as Murali said if you are fired by a desire to
live and work among people you do pick up
languages easily.

The survey helped the party to decide to
focus on the "main contradiction" between
state and the people given the long history
of oppression under the state's forest
department. Sonu told us that initially it took
some time for the people to trust the Party.
One of the first thing which the party did and
which won them a lot of appreciation was
what Kobad Gandhy told a BBC interviewer
--- telling villagers to boil water, which
reduced infant mortality by 50%. Thereafter,
people became receptive to what the party
had to say.

How was trust gained? The first struggle
launched in this area was against the forest
department since the primary problem was
that of land and forest produce. The forest
department had enormous amounts of land
under its authority and also exercised
control over forest products such as _tendu_
_patta_, tamarind and bamboo. Although, said
Sonu, "we were aware of the contradiction
between the tribal chiefs and the people, the
people hesitated to say anything against
them. They did not know much about us and
probably feared that they would face the
brunt of the chief's revenge if the party left
them on their own". Therefore in the initial
years, said Sonu, they took the entire
_adivasi_ population versus the forest
department as the main issue. But even
then, and this is an important difference
between this party and other branches of
CPI(ML), they distinguished themselves by
taking up class issues while following what
the party describes as the mass line. The
party concentrated on mobilizing the poorest
and most oppressed among the tribals so
that over time they became part of the
leadership. The earliest mass organizations
were peasant organisations where women
also took part, but later separate
organisations for women were built to take
up issues for their emancipation. One of the
prime issues around which the party
mobilised the people was regarding labour
rate for _tendu_ leaf collection or for cutting
bamboos. In this largely underdeveloped
area, the contractors used to pay extremely
low rates, lower than even the rate decided
by the government. Against this, starting
from 1981 the party began to mobilize the
_adivasi_ peasants.

It was in the course of this struggle that
people gained confidence about the party as
they observed how party members worked
in the movement against the forest
department and contractors. Murali said that
in the Gadchiroli area, where the Ballarpur
paper mills had leased the bamboo forests
they used to pay Rs. 1 for six bundles (each
consisting of 20 sticks) of bamboo. He said
that earlier the company's agent would meet
the _Mukhia_ and fix the rate in a private deal
with him so that ordinary _adivasis_ had no
say in the matter. This lasted up to 1983
when the party began an agitation which
saw the rates rise to Rs. 1 for three bundles,
then in 1984 to Rs. 1 for two bundles to the
present rate of Rs. 7 per bundle. Similarly, a
bundle of _tendu_ leaves (consisting of 70
leaves) used to fetch 3 paise, whereas it is
now more than a rupee per bundle. These
struggles and successes helped the party
win the confidence of the people. These
were in the nature of wage struggles. Today,
said Murali proudly, in most parts where
_Adivasis_ have been organized by the party
they earn higher than minimum wages.

"How was it dealing with the company
managers or contractors", I asked? Murali
said that it took some years before the
"managers" became convinced that they
could not bypass the "party" or negotiate
with anyone else to get a better deal for
themselves. It was then that bribes began to
be offered. At one of the meeting between
the "agents" and the party activists, the
"agents" suggested that since the party has
ensured welfare of the tribals perhaps they
should start thinking of their own welfare.
Murali said that the party cadres turned on
the agents and asked them why the were so
loyal to their masters? "What harm will it do
to you if you were to pay a fair price to
_adivasis_? If you have money to pay as bribe
surely you have money to pay fair price to
tribals". After that encounter these agents
stopped trying to bribe them.

These successes laid the foundation for the
party's consolidation and expansion. Sonu
pointed out that when _adivasis_ join they do
not join in small trickles but entire villages
get mobilized at about the same time and
this is where the tradition of collective
activity among tribals acts as an enabling
factor. Thereafter, people began to share
the problem they faced from their tribal
chiefs (i.e., _majhis_ and _mukhias_). By 1984, a
Forest Liaison Committee was constituted in
DK for the coordination of the movement. In
1987, a state committee was elected, but
due to the absence of a central level
committee, it worked under the AP state
committee. It was in 1989 that a DK-wide
_adivasi_ peasant organisation was formed in
the form of Dandakaranya _Adivasi_ _Kisan_
Mazdoor Sanghatana (DAKMS). Today it
boasts a membership of more than 100,000
members. Under this organisation, landless
peasants were consolidated under the
slogan --- land to the tillers.
