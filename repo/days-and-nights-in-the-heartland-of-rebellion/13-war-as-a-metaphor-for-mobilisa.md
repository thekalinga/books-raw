# War as a Metaphor for Mobilisation of People

While I was familiar with the fact that
Maoists consider 'people's war' as intrinsic
part of their politics it was in the course of
discussion that clarity over 'political'
emerged. Of what they meant by this. Our
conversation had veered towards some of
the spectacular actions undertaken by them.
I was asking them about Nayagarh in the
state of Orissa. It was then the GS said that
well military action was only one part of the
operation. It was preceded by 8 to 9 month
long political work in the area concerned. It
was therefore, it was called "operation
ropeway" meaning party's leap from
Rayagada into areas beyond and close to
state capital Bhubaneshwar. For months
party members entered Nayagarh and
worked among the people taking some of
them into confidence and establishing
themselves. More than military, i.e. looting of
the armoury, it is this political mobilization
which was successful. Militarily, I found out,
the action was considered less successful.
For one, their reconnaissance underestimated
number of weapons which were in
the armoury, instead of 1200 weapons they
expected no more than 4--500 and 30--40,000
rounds of ammunition as against more than
100,000 rounds which was actually there. As
a result the force which was prepared to
carryout the raid was smaller than what the
armoury raid necessitated. Also the action
was to have taken place in the night and the
guerillas ought to have escaped unseen.
Instead operation began late and was
completed in the early hours of the morning
by when the inhabitants of Nayagarh had
gathered outside and saw in which direction
they retreated. Also they could only carry
300 odd weapons and 50,000 rounds of
ammunition. And yet, if the action was
considered success it was because of the
political mobilization achieved whereby
Maoists expanded into a new area. The
point is to emphasise that every military
action is seen as enabling expansion of
political reach of the party. This is one
aspect. There is another aspect of this.

When I visited Bastar I was told that the JS
had begun to experiment with cooperative
farming. This is a step in the direction of
strengthening what is called "people's
economy". It should be remembered that
people's war is not military actions or
operations. It is essentially, and eighty %
of it, is non-military work. Maoists
consider production by organized militia or
collection of forest produce by militia as part
of its Tactical Counter Offensive Campaign
to meet the personal expenses of the
members as well as needs of war. Thus
engaging in production activities is an
intrinsic part of people's war. This has to be
understood or else we can assume the
worst when reference is made to Peoples
War and conflate it to militarization by the
State.

As explained above PW also means
mobilising resources and taking up welfare
activities like education, providing medical
facilities, distributing food grains and clothes
to the people facing repression and famine
affected. JS distributed seeds and extends
credit to farmers and even in midst of severe
repression it carried out land reform. I recall
reading in 'People's March' supplement of
July 2007 how in Bhairamgarh block of
Dantewada district in Chattisgarh, which
was one of the main centres of _Salwa
Judum_ terror, 768 acres of land of _adivasis_
and non _adivasi_ landlords were seized and
distributed by JS. These villages were:
Takilode, Sathva, Dharma, Belnar, Poosal,
Neerum, Pidiakot, Pollevaya, Palla,
Kodanka, Parkelli, Markapal, Oorsapara and
Oothia. Thus the quite confidence displayed
by the party that people are with them stems
from this fact that those whose lives have
been transformed, thanks to the reforms
carried out by the JS, will stay, get
organized, and offer resistance. This is
substantiated by the fact that in villages of
Bastar region five years of depredation
brought upon by SJ has not weakened but
strengthened the Maoists movement. In this
context their continuous engagement to
improve "people's economy" saw them
introducing cooperative farms in DK which
are a notch higher than land distribution,
work teams etc. in terms of development.

Land which belonged to RPC, was cleared
by villagers at the initiative of the RPC. It
was cultivated by villagers sparing time to
work on the land and then sharing the
harvest. This cooperative farm was an
experiment towards collective farming,
where land is collectively owned through the
RPC. Cultivated by village households and
harvest is shared. This was introduced in
Maad area about two years ago. The first
which struck me was the sight of green
chillies. About 25% of land, where
vegetables were grown, was taken up by
chillies. Red and green chillies are
consumed in large quantity by every one.
But they had also planted _saunf_ (aniseed),
onion, brinjal, gourd, lady fingers,
cauliflower, banana, maize, spinach,
tomatos, lauki, and kaddu. ... I asked
Kumma baba how much labour went into it.
It took one day to clear the land for which 28
villagers came. From each household in the
village nearby one member came to sow the
seeds, two members each came to water
every eight day. And everyday and night two
persons took turn to stand watch against
wild animals destroying the farm.

Narsimha, another ARPC agricultural expert
showed me a field where paddy was sown.
It was an acre and half land. Field was ready
with harvest and in a few days he said
villagers will come to harvest. This he felt
would go someway in making themselves
self-sufficient and reduce their dependence
on _haats_ outside. What is more in time of
need he said JS has to provide food to the
people. How is the produce in such farms
divided? They follow class line with poor
peasants getting it first and then others as
one goes up. Is the vegetable grown for
villagers own consumption or for the
market? The plan was to sell some of the
produce in _haat_ but with _haat_ shifting to
camps this is no longer possible. So maybe
even vegetable plots might switchover to
grain cultivation.

Let me cite from the register of the
Agricultural Department of Toke RPC in
Maad for 2009:

Paddy: 87 _kandi_ (each _kandi_ haqs 20 _pelli_.
Each _pelli_ has 1.5 kgs thus each _kandi_ has
30 kgs) or 2610 kgs from three acres on
which 60 persons worked for two days.

Pulses: 10 _pelli_ or 15 kgs from half acre.
Three ploughs employed one day.

Chavri (vegetable or V grown on Medh): 30
kgs as seeds and 100 kgs for consumption
grown on 70 yards.

Barbati (v): 26 kg. one plough for one day on
half acre.

Mustard: 150 kgs grown on half acre. Three
days work number of people not available
(NA).

Ganga (oilseed): 138 kgs on three acres of
land 10 persons.

Sesame: 15 kgs on less than half acre two
persons ploughed the land.

Pumpkin: 100 kgs Mixed with Kosra grain on
three acres.

Kumhra: 300 kgs again cultivated with Kosra
grain on three acres.

Tomato: 40 kgs.

Cucumber: 200 kgs.

Brinjal: 20 kgs.

Maize: 870 kgs cultivated on the same land
as Mustard. Entire RPC households.

Rahad pulse: 10 kg grown on medh.

Spinach: 10 kg.

Sweet potatoes: 15 kg.

Paddy and Kosra are stored for use during
summer months and for those who are poor.

Dumnar RPC (Maad) distributed 817.5 kg of
paddy to 109 people in 10 villages in 2009.

In the same RPC during monsoon additional
243 kgs of paddy was distributed. They also
provided 622.5 kgs to Vedammetta RPC in 2009.

How many such farms are there under JS?
Unfortunately I could not get any number,
but t in last two years such farms are being
promoted in every village and area RPC.
Thus they could not be few. In Maad I was
told that each RPC had at least one such
cooperative farm, in some cases even more.
What I came across were instances of
success but surely there might be those
which failed? The answer was that none of
the cooperative farms have failed. But I
guess its few years down the line we will
know for sure whether the momentum has
been maintained. Anyhow, as mark of
developing food security these farms will
play a very important role. It is also
significant that some of the party members
were discussing the deficiency in the soil in
Bastar and the need for ammonia, urea and
zinc to improve the soil. Obviously, they
were grappling with issues even in the midst
of gathering storm of war. Or perhaps this
was helping them to accelerate the pace of
this development to meet the likely food
shortages.
