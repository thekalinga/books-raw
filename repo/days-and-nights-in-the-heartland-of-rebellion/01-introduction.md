# Introduction

Truth, it is said, is the first casualty of war.
Therefore, it is not surprising that the Indian
government denies the very fact of
prosecuting a war against the CPI(Maoist)!
Instead, it is said that they are merely
carrying out "police action" to restore civil
authority. A police action brings the image of
baton or _lathi_ wielding cops trying to restore
order in a riotous situation. Whereas 75
battalions (bns) of central paramilitary forces
especially trained in jungle warfare and
assisted by more than 100 bns of state
armed constabularies, the Indian Reserve
bns and the SPOs, all heavily armed, have
been deployed[^/1]. Besides, Union Home
Minister P Chidambaram categorically
asserted that Indian government had a
"legitimate right" to use "as much force as
necessary" against the Maoists (Times of
India, March 13, 2010). An extraordinary
control regime is in place which, among
other things, regulates entry and exit into
areas held by the Maoist guerillas,
somewhat akin to entering another country.
Unless people carry identity cards signed by
the Superintendent of Police they can
neither enter nor exit from the area. As for
movement of goods, this too has been
curtailed; weekly markets have been shifted
to local security camps where one has to
register oneself and provide a list of
members for whom rations are needed, after
which rations are provided to last for no
more than a week. In the past, people living
in the forest had to walk for a few hours to
reach the weekly _haat_ (market), but now the
required travel time is a full day or even two,
because of the location of the market and
additional encumbrances (ID cards, checkpost,
registration at camps, search of bags).

The war on Maoists has been declared not
because they want to overthrow the
presently constituted Indian State, which the
Maoists have been fighting for nearly half a
century[^/2]. By their own admission, it will
take them another 50--60 years to succeed.
Also, to borrow the prime minister's words
while referring to their military strength, the
Maoists possesses "modest capabilities".
The present war also has nothing to do with
their wanton acts of violence, for the record
of parliamentary parties is even worse.
Besides, the fact that more than 62 years
after the transfer of power, 80% of our
people survive on less than or equal to Rs.
20 per day while the top 100 families own
wealth equivalent to 25% of the GDP invites
skepticism of the Indian rulers' commitment
for the lives and liberties of the
overwhelming majority of Indians.

As far as I am concerned, 'Operation Green
Hunt' was launched because the Maoists
offer formidable resistance to the
implementation of hundreds of
Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) for
mining and mineral-based industries in
predominately tribal India, where they enjoy
considerable support[^/3]. Without weakening
this resistance, Government of India's
mineral as well as Foreign Direct Investment
(FDI) policy will remain unrealized. It is
worth remembering that there is a
consensus between the Congress, BJP and
CPI (M) to curtail the political activities of
"LWE" and to create an atmosphere, in the
words of the prime minister, "conducive to
investment" and "rapid economic
development". This has laid the ground for a
long drawn out bloodletting, the likes of
which has not been seen in the 60 years
since 1947. This will be a "fight to the finish",
in which one side is bent on destroying the
'LWE' and the other side determined to
defend themselves. It threatens to be a
prolonged attritional war. Having staked so
much in this policy and invested in
prosecuting this war, it is not surprising that
the government shows no signs of reversing
or radically modifying its current policies.
Furthermore, unmindful of larger public
concerns, it is even reluctant to make public
the MOUs signed by various state
governments citing "commercial secrets". In
other words, the Indian government has
much to hide.

Democratic rights activists oppose war
against our own people, under any pretext,
because political aspirations ought not to be
suppressed militarily. Behind every war is a
long history of struggle, over-ground and
peaceful. In the last 62 years, fifteen
parliaments have been voted in, and it is
apparent to any discerning person that a
vast majority of voters continue to remain
impoverished, disempowered and barely
able to survive. It is also our experience that
once laws are invoked under the rubric of
"national security", they not only criminalizes
legitimate activities but also simultaneously
legitimise unlawful acts of the State. This
means that once the state proscribes an
organization and places curbs on its
activities (such as dissemination of
propaganda, organizing, etc.), then anyone
offering any help to a member of the
proscribed organization (e.g., medical help,
legal assistance, or even help a member of
such organization get employment) or
attending/addressing a meeting organized
by them ends up committing a crime. Were
this ban to be lifted, the very same actions
cease to incriminate. Thus, the most
innocuous facts can get invested with
criminal intent when "national security"
considerations come into play. Also, there is
a strong likelihood of evidence being
manufactured, and facts misconstrued or
twisted to suit the State's objective of
silencing critics of its policy (of curbing the
so-called internal security threats).

We are witness to systematic abuse by
authorities wielding arbitrary powers. Apart
from arrests, tortures, and fake encounters,
the State has become brazen enough to
suppress voices of dissent by accusing them
of being a "_Naxalite_ sympathizer", as though
to be a _Naxalite_ or a Maoist is in itself
criminal[^/4]. It took Supreme Court judges to
remind the government counsels that to hold
sympathies is not a crime. Recently, we also
witnessed an attempt by officials
representing the Union and Chattisgarh
Governments,to mislead the Supreme Court
about a purported ambush that took place in
the early hours of February 9, 2010 near
Gachchanpalli in Dantewada district of
Chattisgarh[^/5]. While on the one hand
proclaimed absconders sought by the first
class magistrate in Konta (Chattisgarh) for a
crime of alleged gang rape brazenly move
around the Bastar region in full view of the
police, on the other hand the police accost,
threaten and lead mobs to attack social
activists (and little of this finds its way into
the corporate newspapers). Independent
social activists \[such as Himanshu Kumar of
the Vanvasi Chetna Ashram (VCA)\] have
been evicted from the areas, a women's
team that visited Narayanpatna in Orissa
and members of National Association of
Peoples Movement who went to Dantewada
(Chattisgarh) were thwarted from visiting the
areas to ensure that truth about the dirty war
does not finds its way into the public
domain. Even the home minister shied away
from attending a public hearing in
Dantewada after promising to do so in a
published interview. Indeed, government
forces on the ground carried out demolition
of VCA ashram, arrested, beat up and
implicated in criminal cases members of
VCA, prevented social activists from
reaching Dantewada and siding with mobs
led by proclaimed offenders.

It is this repressive climate of war which
makes it incumbent upon us to not succumb
to official diktats to tailor our convictions, but
instead go beyond official propaganda to
understand for ourselves the Maoists, who
are our own people.
