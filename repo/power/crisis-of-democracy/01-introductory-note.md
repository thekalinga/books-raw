# INTRODUCTORY NOTE

Is democracy in crisis? This question is being posed with
increasing urgency by some of the leading statesmen of the
West, by columnists and scholars, and --- if public opinion polls
are to be trusted --- even by the publics. In some respects, the
mood of today is reminiscent of that of the early twenties,
when the views of Oswald Spengler regarding "The Decline of
the West" were highly popular. This pessimism is echoed,
with obvious _Schadenfreude_, by various communist observers,
who speak with growing confidence of "the general
crisis of capitalism" and who see in it the confirmation of
their own theories.

The report which follows is not a pessimistic document. Its
authors believe that, in a fundamental sense, the democratic
systems are viable. They believe, furthermore, that democracies
can work _provided_ their publics truly understand the
nature of the democratic system, and particularly if they are
sensitive to the subtle interrelationship between liberty and
responsibility. Their discussion of "The Crisis of Democracy"
is designed to make democracy stronger as it grows and becomes
more and more democratic. Their conclusions --- doubtless
in some respects provocative-are designed to serve that
overriding objective.

The Trilateral Commission decided to undertake this
project because it has felt, rightly in my view, that the vitality
of our political systems is a central precondition for the
shaping of a stable international order and for the fashioning
of more cooperative relations among our regions. Though
very much concerned with issues pertaining to foreign affairs,
trilateral as well as East-West and North-South, the Trilateral
Commission has promoted the study which follows in the
belief that at this juncture it is important for the citizens of
our democracies to reexamine the basic premises and the
workings of our systems. This rethinking can contribute, it is
our hope, to the promotion of the central purposes of the
democratic system of government: the combination of personal
liberty with the enhancement of social progress.

This report has been prepared for the Trilateral Commission
and is released under its auspices. The Commission is
making the report available for wider distribution as a contribution
to informed discussion and handling of the issues
treated. The report was discussed at the Trilateral Commission
meetings in Kyoto, Japan, on May 30--31, 1975. The
authors, who are experts from North America, Western
Europe and Japan, have been free to present their own views.

The report is the joint responsibility of the three rapporteurs
of the Trilateral Commission's Task Force on the
Governability of Democracies, which was set up in the spring
of 1974 and which submitted its report in the spring of 1975.
The chapter on Japan is the work of Joji Watanuki. The
chapter on Western Europe is the work of Michel Crozier.
The chapter on the United States is the work of Samuel P.
Huntington.

Although only the three authors are responsible for
the analysis and conclusions, they were aided in their task by
consultations with experts from the trilateral regions. In each
case, consultants spoke for themselves as individuals and not
as representatives of any institutions with which they are
associated. Those consulted included the following:

\ 

Robert R. Bowie, _Professor of International Affairs,
Harvard University_

Zbigniew Brzezinski, _Director, The Trilateral Commission_

James Cornford, _Professor of Politics, University of Edinburgh_

George S. Franklin, _North American Secretary, The Trilateral
Commission_

Donald M. Fraser, _United States House of Representatives_

Karl Kaiser, _Director, Research Institute of the German
Society for Foreign Policy_

Seymour Martin Lipset, _Professor of Sociology, Harvard
University_

John Meisel, _Professor of Political Science, Queen's University_

Erwin Scheuch, _Professor of Political Science, University
of Cologne_

Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., _Professor of Humanities, The
City University of New York_

Gerard C. Smith, _North American Chairman, The Trilateral
Commission_

Yasumasa Tanaka, _Professor of Political Science, Gakushuin
University_

Tadashi Yamamoto, _Japanese Secretary, The Trilateral
Commission_

\ 

In the course of its work, the task force held a number of
joint meetings:

\ 

April 20--21, 1974 --- Rapporteurs and Brzezinski met in Palo
Alto, California, to develop general outline of report.

November 11--12, 1974 --- Rapporteurs and Brzezinski met in
London to consider first drafts of regional chapters and
establish more precise outline of study.

February 22--23, 1975 --- Rapporteurs met with experts from
Trilateral regions in New York City, considered second
drafts of regional chapters and draft of Introduction.

May 31, 1975 --- Full draft of study debated in plenary meeting
of The Trilateral Commission in Kyoto.

I would like to express our appreciation for the energy and
dedication shown by Charles Heck and Gertrude Werner in
preparing this book for publication.
