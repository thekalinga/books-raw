# THE UNITED STATES[^3/s1] by Samuel P. Huntington

## THE VITALITY AND GOVERNABILITY OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY

The 1960s witnessed a dramatic renewal of the
democratic spirit in America. The predominant trends of that
decade involved the challenging of the authority of
established political, social, and economic institutions,
increased popular participation in and control over those
institutions, a reaction against the concentration of power in
the executive branch of the federal government and in favor
of the reassertion of the power of Congress and of state and
local government, renewed commitment to the idea of
equality on the part of intellectuals and other elites, the
emergence of "public interest" lobbying groups, increased
concern for the rights of and provision of opportunities for
minorities and women to participate in the polity and
economy, and a pervasive criticism of those who possessed or
were even thought to possess excessive power or wealth.[^3/s2]
The spirit of protest, the spirit of equality, the impulse to
expose and correct inequities were abroad in the land. The
themes of the 1960s were those of the Jacksonian Democracy
and the muckraking Progressives; they embodied ideas and
beliefs which were deep in the American tradition but which
usually do not command the passionate intensity of commitment
that they did in the 1960s. That decade bore testimony
to the vitality of the democratic idea. It was a decade of
democratic surge and of the reassertion of democratic egalitarianism.

[^3/s1]: I am indebted to Kevin Middlebrook and Kenneth Juster for their
efficient help in the collection of material and data for this paper.

This democratic surge manifested itself in an almost
endless variety of ways. Consider, for instance, simply a few
examples of this surge in terms of the two democratic norms
of participation and equality. Voting participation, which
had increased during the 1940s and 1950s, declined during
the 1960s, reaching lows of 55.6 percent in the 1972
presidential election and of 38 percent in the 1974 midterm
election. Almost all other forms of political participation,
however, saw a significant increase during the 1950s and
continuing into the 1960s. An index of campaign activity
(representing the mean number of campaign acts performed
each year) rose from a low of .58 in the 1952 election to a
peak of .83 in the 1960 election; thereafter, it declined
somewhat and leveled off, registering .69 in 1962, .77 in
1964, .73 in 1968, returning to its previous high of .83 in
1970, and then dropping to .73 in 1972.[^3/1] The overall picture
is one of a sharp increase in campaign activity in the 1950s
following which it remained on a high plateau in the 1960s.
The Goldwater, McCarthy, Wallace, and McGovern
candidacies mobilized unprecented numbers of volunteer
campaign workers. In addition, the Republicans in 1962 and
the Democrats subsequently launched a series of major
efforts to raise a substantial portion of their campaign funds
from large numbers of small givers. In 1972 Nixon and
McGovern each collected $13 million to $15 million in small
amounts from over 500,000 contributors.

[^3/s2]: In addition to these democratic trends, and often interspersed with
them there were also, of course, some markedly antidemocratic trends
in the 1960s: elitist discrimination against middle-class groups (rationalized
in the name of egalitarianism); the suppression of free speech
(particularly on university campuses); and the resort by extremist
minorities to physical coercion and violence. These activities formed,
in a sense, the dark outriders of the democratic surge, swept up in the
same sense of movement, but serving different goals with very different
means.

The 1960s also saw, of course, a marked upswing in other
forms of citizen participation, in the form of marches,
demonstrations, protest movements, and "cause"
organizations (such as Common Cause, Nader groups, and
environmental groups.) The expansion of participation
throughout society was reflected in the markedly higher
levels of self-consciousness on the part of blacks, Indians
Chicanos, white ethnic groups, students, and women --- all of
whom became mobilized and organized in new ways to
achieve what they considered to be their appropriate share of
the action and of the rewards. The results of their efforts
were testimony to the ability of the American political
system to respond to the pressures of newly active groups, to
assimilate those groups into the political system, and to
incorporate members of those groups into the political
leadership structure. Blacks and women made impressive
gains in their representation in state legislatures and Congress,
and in 1974 the voters elected one woman and two Chicano
governors. In a similar vein, there was a marked expansion of
white-collar unionism and of the readiness and willingness for
clerical, technical, and professional employees in public and
private bureaucracies to assert themselves and to secure
protection for their rights and privileges. Previously passive or
unorganized groups in the population now embarked on
concerted efforts to establish their claims to opportunities,
positions, rewards, and privileges, which they had not
considered themselves entitled to before.

In a related and similar fashion, the 1960s also saw a
reassertion of the primacy of equality as a goal in social,
economic, and political life. The meaning of equality and the
means of achieving it became central subjects of debate in
intellectual and policy-oriented circles. What was widely
hailed as the major philosophical treatise of the decade
(Rawls, _A Theory of Justice_) defined justice largely in terms
of equality. Differences in wealth and power were viewed
with increased skepticism. The classic issue of equality of
opportunity versus equality of results was reopened for
debate. The prevailing preoccupation with equality was well
revealed in the titles of books produced by social theorists
and sociologists over the course of three or four years.[^3/2] This
intellectual concern over equality did not, of course, easily
transmit itself into widespread reduction of inequality in
society. But the dominant thrust in political and social action
was all clearly in that direction.

The causes of this democratic surge of the 1960s could
conceivably be: (a) either permanent or transitory; (b)
either peculiar to the United States or more generally
pervasive throughout the advanced industrialized world. The
surge might, for instance, be the result of long-term social,
economic, and cultural trends which were producing
permanent changes in American society (often subsumed
under the heading of the "emergence of post-industrial
society") and which would in due course equally affect other
advanced industrialized countries. Or it could have been the
product of rapid social and cultural change or upheaval in the
1960s which in itself was transitory and whose political
consequences would hence eventually fade, that is, it could
have been the product of a transitory _process_ of change
rather than the product of the lasting _results_ of change (e.g.,
the rapid expansion of higher education enrollments in the
1960s rather than the resulting high level of enrollment in
higher education). In addition, given the similarities which
appeared to exist between the political temper and
movements of the 1960s and earlier periods in American
history, it is possible that the surge could have reflected a
peculiarly American dynamic working itself out on a
recurring or cyclical basis. On the other hand, it is also
possible that the sources for the democratic surge were in a
transient yet general crisis of the industrialized world which
manifested itself in comparable if different ways in other
Trilateral countries. Or, of course, most probable in fact and
least satisfying in theory, the surge could be the product of a
mixture of factors, permanent and transitory, specific and
general.

"In framing a government which is to be administered by
men over men," observed James Madison in _The Federalist_,
no. 51, "the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable
the government to control the governed, and in the next
place oblige it to control itself." To assume that there is no
conflict between these two requirements is sheer
self-delusion. To assume that it is impossible to reach a rough
balance between these two requirements is unrealistic
pessimism. The maintenance of that balance is, indeed, what
constitutional democracy is all about. Over the centuries, the
United States has probably been more successful than any
other government in combining governmental authority and
limits on that authority in an effective manner appropriate to
the environment, domestic and external, in which that
government has operated. Views as to what constitutes the
precise desirable balance between power and liberty,
authority and democracy, government and society obviously
differ. In fact, the actual balance shifts from one historical
period to another. Some fluctuation in the balance is not
only acceptable but may be essential to the effective
functioning of constitutional democracy. At the same time,
excessive swings may produce either too much government or
too little authority. The democratic surge of the 1960s raised
once again in dramatic fashion the issue of whether the
pendulum had swung too far in one direction.

The consequences of that surge will be felt for years to
come. The analysis here focuses on the immediate --- and
somewhat contradictory --- effects of the democratic surge on
government. The basic point is this: _The vitality of
democracy in the United States in the 1960s produced a
substantial increase in governmental activity and a substantial
decrease in governmental authority._ By the early 1970s
Americans were progressively demanding and receiving more
benefits from their government and yet having less
confidence in their government than they had a decade
earlier. And paradoxically, also, this working out of the
democratic impulse was associated with the shift in the
relative balance in the political system between the decline of
the more political, interest-aggregating, "input" institutions
of government (most notably, political parties and the
presidency), on the one hand, and the growth in the
bureaucratic, regulating and implementing, "output"
institutions of government, on the other. The vitality of
democracy in the 1960s raised questions about the
governability of democracy in the 1970s. The expansion of
governmental activities produced doubts about the economic
solvency of government; the decrease in governmental authority
produced doubts about the political solvency of government.
The impulse of democracy is to make government
less powerful and more active, to increase its functions, and
to decrease its authority. The questions to be discussed are:
How deep are these trends? How can these seemingly contradictory
courses be reconciled within the framework of the
existing political system? If a balance is to be restored between
governmental activity and governmental authority,
what are the consequences of this restoration for the democratic
surge and movement of the 1960s? Does an increase in
the vitality of democracy _necessarily_ have to mean a decrease
in the governability of democracy?

## THE EXPANSION OF GOVERNMENTAL ACTIVITY

The structure of governmental activity in the United
States --- in terms of both its size and its content --- went
through two major changes during the quarter-century after
World War II. The first change, the Defense Shift, was a
response to the external Soviet threat of the 1940s; the
second change, the Welfare Shift, was a response to the
internal democratic surge of the 1960s. The former was
primarily the product of elite leadership; the latter was
primarily the result of popular expectations and group
demands.

The year 1948 is an appropriate starting point for the
analysis of these changes in the structure of governmental
activity.[^3/s3] By that time governmental activity had adjusted
from its wartime levels and forms; demobilization had been
completed; the nation was setting forth on a new peacetime
course. In that year, total governmental expenditures
(federal, state, and local) amounted to 20 percent of GNP;
national defense expenditures were 4 percent of GNP; and
governmental purchases of goods and services were 12
percent of GNP. During the next five years these figures
changed drastically. The changes were almost entirely due to
the onslaught of the Cold War and the perception eventually
shared by the top executives of the government --- Truman,
Acheson, Forrestal, Marshall, Harriman, and Lovett --- that a
major effort was required to counter the Soviet threat to the
security of the West. The key turning points in the
development of that perception included Soviet pressure on
Greece and Turkey, the Czech coup, the Berlin blockade, the
communist conquest of China, the Soviet atomic explosion,
and the North Korean attack on South Korea, In late 1949, a
plan for major rearmament to meet this threat was drawn up
within the executive branch. The top executive leaders,
however, felt that neither Congress nor public opinion was
ready to accept such a large-scale military buildup. These
political obstacles were removed by the outbreak of the
Korean war in June 1950.[^3/3]

[^3/s3] In this analysis, governmental activity will be measured primarily in
terms of governmental expenditures. This indicator, of course, does not
do justice to many types of governmental activity, such as regulatory
action or the establishment of minimum standards (e.g., for automotive
safety or pollution levels or school desegregation), which have major
impact on the economy and society and yet do not cost very much. In
addition, the analysis here will focus primarily not on absolute levels of
governmental expenditures, which obviously expanded greatly both due
to inflation and in real terms, but rather
the relations among
expenditures, revenues, and the GNP and among different types of
expenditures.

The result was a major expansion in the U.S. military
forces and drastic reshaping of the structure of
governmental expenditures and activity. By 1953 national
defense expenditures had gone up from their 1948 level of
$10.7 billion to $48.7 billion. Instead of 4 percent of GNP,
they now constituted over 13 percent of GNP. Nondefense
expenditures remained stable at 15 percent of GNP, thus
making overall governmental expenditures 28 percent of GNP
(as against 20 percent in 1948) and government purchases of
goods and services 22 percent of GNP (as against 12 percent
in 1948). The governmental share of the output of the
American economy, in short, increased by about 80 percent
during these five years, virtually all of it in the national
defense sector.

With the advent of the Eisenhower administration and the
end of the Korean war, these proportions shifted somewhat
and then settled into a relatively fixed pattern of
relationships, which remained markedly stable for over a
decade. From 1954 to 1966, governmental expenditures were
usually about 27 percent or 28 percent of GNP; governmental
purchases of goods and services varied between 19 percent
and 22 percent; and defense expenditures, with the exception
of a brief dip in 1964 and 1965, were almost constantly
stable at 9 percent to 10 percent of GNP. The basic pattern
for this period was in effect:

In the mid-1960s, however, the stability of this pattern
was seriously disrupted. The Vietnam war caused a minor
disruption, reversing the downward trend in the defense
proportion of GNP visible in 1964 and 1965 and temporarily
restoring defense to 9 percent of GNP. The more significant
and lasting change was the tremendous expansion of the
nondefense activities of government. Between 1965 and
1974, total governmental expenditures rose from 27 percent
to 33 percent of GNP; governmental purchases of goods and
services, on the other hand, which had also increased
simultaneously with total expenditures between 1948 and
1953, changed only modestly from 20 percent in 1965 to 22
percent in 1974. This difference meant, of course, that a
substantial proportion of the increase in governmental
spending was in the form of transfer payments; for example,
welfare and social security benefits, rather than additional
governmental contributions to the Gross National Product.
Nondefense expenditures, which had been 20 percent of GNP
in 1965, were 25 percent of GNP in 1971 and an estimated 27
percent of GNP in 1974. Defense spending went down to 7
percent of GNP in 1971 and 6 percent in 1974. Back in
1948, defense spending had been less than 20 percent of total
governmental spending. At the peak of the defense build-up
in 1953 it amounted to 46 percent of the total, and during
the long period of stable relationships in the 1950s and
1960s, defense accounted for about 33 percent of total
governmental spending. Under the impact of the Welfare
Shift of the late 1960s, however, the defense proportion of
total governmental spending again dropped down to less than
one-fifth of total governmental spending, that is, to the
relationship which had prevailed in 1948 before the military
implications of the Cold War had become evident.

The extent of the Welfare Shift in the scope and substance
of governmental activity can also be seen by comparing the
changes in governmental expenditures during the two decades
of the 1950s and 1960s. Between 1950 and 1960, total
governmental expenditures rose by $81.0 billion, of which
$29.1 billion or roughly 36 percent was for defense and
international relations. Between 1960 and 1971, governmental
expenditures increased by $218.1 billion, of which,
however; only $33.4 billion or roughly 15 percent were
accounted for by defense and international relations, while
expenditures for domestic programs grew by $184.7 billion.
This growth in domestic spending is also reflected in a change
in the relative shares of federal, state, and local governments
in total governmental expenditures. In 1960 the federal
government share of total government spending, 59.7 percent,
was virtually identical with what it had been ten years
earlier, 60.3 percent. By 1971, the relative growth in state
and local spending had dropped the federal share of
governmental expenditures down to 53.8 percent of total
governmental expenditures.[^3/4]

The major increases in government spending during the
1960s occurred in education, social security and related
insurance benefits, public welfare, interest on the public
debt, health, and hospitals. In 1960, government at all levels
in the United States spent about 125 percent more for
defense than it did for education; in 1972 it spent less than
15 percent more. In 1960, defense spending was about
four-and-a-half times that for social security; in 1972 it was less
than twice as much. In 1960 ten times as much was spent on
defense as on welfare; in 1972 the ratio was less than four to
one. Even in terms of federal government spending alone, the
same trends were visible. In FY 1960, total foreign affairs
spending accounted for 53.7 percent of the federal budget,
while expenditures for cash income maintenance accounted
for 22.3 percent. In FY 1974, according to Brookings
Institution estimates, almost equal amounts were spent for
both these purposes, with foreign affairs taking 33 percent
and cash income maintenance 31 percent of the federal
budget.[^3/5] Across the board, the tendency was for massive
increases in governmental expenditures to provide cash and
benefits for particular individuals and groups within society
rather than in expenditures designed to serve national
purposes vis-à-vis the external environment.

The Welfare Shift, like the Defense Shift before it,
underlined the close connection between the structure of
governmental activity and the trend of public opinion.
During the 1940s and early 1950s, the American public
willingly approved massive programs for defense and
international affairs. When queried on whether the military
budget or the size of the armed forces should be increased,
decreased, or remain about the same, the largest proportions
of the public almost consistently supported a greater military
effort. In March 1950, for instance, before the Korean war
and the NSC 68 rearmament effort, 64 percent of the public
thought defense spending should be increased, 7 percent
thought it should be decreased and 24 percent thought it
should remain about the same. These figures were typical
results of the early years of the Cold War. During the middle
and later 1950s, after defense spending had in fact expanded
greatly, support for still further expansion eased somewhat.
But even then, only a small minority of the public supported
a decrease, with the largest group approving the existing level
of defense effort. Popular support for other government
programs, including all domestic programs and foreign aid,
almost always was substantially less than support for defense
spending.[^3/6]

During the mid-1960s, at the peak of the democratic surge
and of the Vietnam war, public opinion on these issues
changed drastically. When asked in 1960, for instance, how
they felt about current defense spending, 18 percent of the
public said the United States was spending too much on
defense, 21 percent said too little, and 45 percent said the
existing level was about right. Nine years later, in July 1969,
the proportion of the public saying that too much was being
spent on defense had zoomed up from 18 percent to 52
percent; the proportion thinking that too little was being
spent on defense had dropped from 21 percent to 8 percent
and the proportion approving the current level had declined
from 45 percent to 31 percent. This new pattern of opinion
on defense remained relatively stable during the late 1960s
and early 1970s. Simultaneously, public opinion became
more favorable to governmental spending for domestic
programs. When polled in 1974, for instance, on whether
spending should be increased, decreased, or remain about the
same for some twenty-three governmental programs, the
composite scores (where 50 represents maintaining the
existing level) for domestic programs were all in favor of an
increase, ranging from a score of 51 for welfare programs for
low income families up to scores of 84 and 86 for helping the
elderly and developing greater self-sufficiency in energy. All
five foreign affairs programs rated much lower than any
domestic program, with their scores ranging from 39 for total
defense spending down to 20 for military aid for allies. For
every foreign affairs program, the weight of opinion was thus
in favor of reduced rather than higher spending. The overall
average score for domestic programs was 70, and for foreign
policy and defense programs it was only 29.[^3/7] During the
1960s, a dramatic and large-scale change thus took place in
public opinion with respect to governmental activity.

So far, our analysis has focused on the relations between
governmental expenditures and GNP and between different
types of expenditures. The growth in expenditures, however,
also raises important issues concerning the relation between
expenditures and revenues. After the Defense Shift, during
the 1950s and early 1960s, governmental expenditures
normally exceeded governmental revenue, but with one
exception (1959, when the deficit was $15 billion), the gap
between the two was not large in any single year. In the late
1960s, on the other hand, after the fiscal implications of the
Welfare Shift had been felt, the overall governmental deficit
took on new proportions. In 1968 it was $17 billion and in
1971 $27 billion. The cumulative deficit for the five years
from 1968 through 1971 was $43 billion. The federal
government was, of course, the principal source of the
overall government deficit. In nine of the ten fiscal years
after 1965 the federal budget showed a deficit; the total
deficit for those ten years came to an estimated $111.8
billion, of which $74.6 billion came in the five years for FY
1971 through FY 1975.[^3/8]

The excess of expenditures over revenues was obviously
one major source of the inflation which plagued the United
States, along with most other industrial countries, in the
early 1970s. Inflation was, in effect, one way of paying for
the new forms of government activity produced by the
Welfare Shift. The extent of the fiscal gap, its apparent
inevitability and intractableness, and its potentially
destabilizing effects were sufficiently ominous for the
existing system to generate a new variety of Marxist analysis
of the inevitable collapse of capitalism. "The fiscal crisis of
the capitalist state," in James O'Connor's words, "is the
inevitable consequence of the structural gap between state
expenditures and revenues." As Daniel Bell suggests, in
effect, the argument represents a neo-neo-Marxism: The
original Marxism said the capitalist crisis would result from
anarchical competition; neo-Marxism said it would be the
result of war and war expenditures, the garrison state; now,
the most recent revision, taking into consideration the
Welfare Shift, identifies the expansion of social expenditures
as the source of the fiscal crisis of capitalism.[^3/9] What the
Marxists mistakenly attribute to capitalist economics, however,
is, in fact, a product of democratic politics.

The Defense Shift involved a major expansion of the
national effort devoted to military purposes followed by
slight reduction and stabilization of the relation of that
activity to total national product. The Welfare Shift has
produced a comparable expansion and redirection of
governmental activity. The key question is: To what extent
will this expansion be limited in scope and time, as was the
defense expansion, or to what extent will it be an
open-ended, continuing phenomenon? Has nondefense
governmental spending peaked at about 27 percent of GNP?
Or will it increase further or, conceivably, decrease? The
beneficiaries of governmental largesse coupled with
governmental employees constitute a substantial portion of
the public. Their interests clearly run counter to those groups
in the public which receive relatively little in cash benefits
from the government but must contribute taxes to provide
governmental payments to other groups in society. On the
one hand, history suggests that the recipients of subsidies,
particularly producer groups, have more specific interests, are
more self-conscious and organized, and are better able to
secure access to the political decision points than the more
amorphous, less well-organized, and more diffuse taxpaying
and consumer interests. On the other hand, there is also some
evidence that the conditions favorable to large-scale
governmental programs, which existed in the 1960s, may
now be changing significantly. The political basis of the
Welfare Shift was the expansion in political participation and
the intensified commitment to democratic and egalitarian
norms which existed in the 1960s. Levels of political
participation in campaigns have leveled off, and other forms
of political participation would appear to have declined.
Some polls suggest that the public has become more
conservative in its attitudes towards government generally
and more hostile towards the expansion of governmental
activity. In 1972, for instance, for the first time, as many
liberals as conservatives agreed with the proposition that
government is too big. At the same time, liberals continued
to be heavily in favor of new government programs, such as
national health insurance, which conservatives opposed. If,
however, the general skepticism about what government can
accomplish remains a significant component of public
opinion, the pattern of governmental activity which the
Welfare Shift produced by the early 1970s could well remain
relatively stable for the immediate future.

## THE DECLINE IN GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY

### The Democratic Challenge to Authority

The essence of the democratic surge of the 1960s was a
general challenge to existing systems of authority, public and
private. In one form or another, this challenge manifested
itself in the family, the university, business, public and
private associations, politics, the governmental bureaucracy,
and the military services. People no longer felt the same
compulsion to obey those whom they had previously
considered superior to themselves in age, rank, status,
expertise, character, or talents. Within most organizations,
discipline eased and differences in status became blurred.
Each group claimed its right to participate equally --- and
perhaps more than equally --- in the decisions which affected
itself. More precisely, in American society, authority had
been commonly based on: organizational position, economic
wealth, specialized expertise, legal competence, or electoral
representativeness. Authority based on hierarchy, expertise,
and wealth all, obviously, ran counter to the democratic and
egalitarian temper of the times, and during the 1960s, all three
came under heavy attack. In the university, students who
lacked expertise, came to participate in the decision-making
process on many important issues. In the government,
organizational hierarchy weakened, and organizational subordinates
more readily acted to ignore, to criticize, or to
defeat the wishes of their organizational superiors. In politics
generally, the authority of wealth was challenged and
successful efforts made to introduce reforms to expose and
to limit its influence. Authority derived from legal and
electoral sources did not necessarily run counter to the spirit
of the times, but when it did, it too was challenged and
restricted. The commandments of judges and the actions of
legislatures were legitimate to the extent that they promoted,
as they often did, egalitarian and participatory goals. "Civil
disobedience," after all, was the claim to be morally right in
disobeying a law which was morally wrong. It implied that
the moral value of law-abiding behavior in a society depended
upon what was in the laws, not on the procedural due process
by which they were enacted. Finally, electoral legitimacy
was, obviously, more congruent with the democratic surge,
but even so, it too at times was questioned, as the value of
"categorical" representativeness was elevated to challenge the
principle of electoral representativeness.

The questioning of authority pervaded society. In politics,
it manifested itself in a decline in public confidence and trust
in political leaders and institutions, a reduction in the power
and effectiveness of political institutions such as the political
parties and presidency, a new importance for the "adversary"
media and "critical" intelligentsia in public affairs, and a
weakening of the coherence, purpose, and self-confidence of
political leadership.

### Decline in Public Confidence and Trust

In a democracy, the authority of governmental leaders and
institutions presumably depends in part on the extent to
which the public has confidence and trust in those
institutions and leaders. During the 1960s that confidence
and trust declined markedly in the United States. That
decline can, in turn, be related back to a somewhat earlier
tendency towards ideological and policy polarization which,
in turn, had its roots in the expansion of political
participation in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The
democratic surge involved a more politically active citizenry,
which developed increased ideological consistency on public
issues, and which then lost its confidence in public institutions
and leaders when governmental policies failed to
correspond to what they desired. The sequence and direction
of these shifts in public opinion dramatically illustrates how
the vitality of democracy in the 1960s (as manifested in
increased political participation) produced problems for the
governability of democracy in the 1970s (as manifested in
the decreased public confidence in government).

During the 1960s public opinion on major issues of public
policy tended to become more polarized and ideologically
structured, that is, people tended to hold more consistent
liberal or conservative attitudes on public policy issues.
Between 1956 and 1960, for instance, an index of ideological
consistency for the average American voter hovered about
.15; in 1964 it more than doubled to .40 and remained at
similar levels through 1972.[^3/10] Thus, the image of American
voters as independently and pragmatically making up their
minds in ad hoc fashion on the merits of different issues
became rather far removed from actuality.

This pattern of developing polarization and ideological
consistency had its roots in two factors. First, those who are
more active in politics are also more likely to have consistent
and systematic views on policy issues. The increase in
political participation in the early 1960s was thus followed
by heightened polarization of political opinion in the
mid-1960s. The increase in polarization, in turn, often
involved higher levels of group consciousness (as among
blacks) which then stimulated more political participation (as
in the white backlash).

Second, the polarization was clearly related to the nature
of the issues which became the central items on the political
agenda of the mid-1960s. The three major clusters of issues
which then came to the fore were: social issues, such as use
of drugs, civil liberties, and the role of women; racial issues,
involving integration, busing, government aid to minority
groups, and urban riots; military issues, involving primarily,
of course, the war in Vietnam but also the draft, military
spending, military aid programs, and the role of the
military-industrial complex more generally. All three sets of
issues, but particularly the social and racial issues, tended to
generate high correlations between the stands which people
took on individual issues and their overall political ideology.
On more strictly economic issues, on the other hand,
ideology was a much less significant factor. Thus, to predict
positions of individuals on the legalization of marijuana or
school integration or the size of the defense budget, one
would want to ask them whether they considered themselves
liberals, moderates, or conservatives. To predict their stand
on federally financed health insurance, one should ask them
whether they were Democrats, Independents, or Republicans.[^3/11]

The polarization over issues in the mid-1960s in part, at
least, explains the major decline in trust and confidence in
government of the later 1960s. Increasingly, substantial
portions of the American public took more extreme positions
on policy issues; those who took more extreme positions on
policy issues, in turn, tended to become more distrustful of
government.[^3/12] Polarization over issues generated distrust
about government, as those who had strong positions on
issues became dissatisfied with the ambivalent, compromising
policies of government. Political leaders, in effect, alienated
more and more people by attempting to please them through
the time-honored traditional politics of compromise.

At the end of the 1950s, for instance, about three-quarters
of the American people thought that their government was
run primarily for the benefit of the people and only 17
percent thought that it primarily responded to what "big
interests" wanted. These proportions steadily changed during
the 1960s, stabilizing at very different levels in the early
1970s. By the latter half of 1972, only 38 percent of the
population thought that government was "run for the benefit
of all the people" and a majority of 53 percent thought that
it was "run by a few big interests looking out for
themselves." (See Table 3.) In 1959, when asked what they
were most proud of about their country, 85 percent of
Americans (as compared to 46 percent of Britons, 30 percent
of Mexicans, 7 percent of Germans, and 3 percent of Italians,
in the same comparative survey) mentioned their "political
institutions." By 1973, however, 66 percent of a national
sample of Americans said that they were dissatisfied by the
way in which their country was governed.[^3/13] In similar
fashion, in 1958, 71 percent of the population felt that they
could trust the government in Washington to do what was
right "all" or "most" of the time, while only 23 percent said
that they could trust it only "some" or "none" of the time.
By late 1972, however, the percentage which would trust the
national government to do what was right all or most of the
time had declined to 52 percent, while that which thought it
would do what was right only some or none of the time had
doubled to 45 percent. (See Table 4.) Again, the pattern of
change shows a high level of confidence in the 1950s, a sharp
decline of confidence during the 1960s, and a leveling off at
much reduced levels of confidence in the early 1970s.

Questions:

(1) 1958: Do you think that the high-up people in government give
everyone a fair break whether they are big shots or just ordinary
people, or do you think some of them pay more attention to what
the big interests want?

(2) Other years: Would you say the government is pretty much run by
a few big interests looking out for themselves or that it is run
for the benefit of all the people?

The precipitous decline in public confidence in their
leaders in the latter part of the 1960s and the leveling off or
partial restoration of confidence in the early 1970s can also
be seen in other data which permit a comparison between
attitudes towards government and other major institutions in
society. Between 1966 and 1971 the proportion of the
population having a "great deal of confidence" in the leaders
of each of the major governmental institutions was cut in
half. (See Table 5.) By 1973, however, public confidence in
the leadership of the Congress, the Supreme Court, and the
military had begun to be renewed from the lows of two years
earlier. Confidence in the leadership of the executive branch,
on the other hand, was --- not surprisingly --- at its lowest point.
These changes of attitudes toward governmental leadership
did not occur in a vacuum but were part of a general
weakening of confidence in institutional leadership. The
leadership of the major nongovernmental institutions in
society who had enjoyed high levels of public confidence in
the mid-1960s --- such as large corporations, higher educational
institutions and medicine --- also suffered a somewhat similar
pattern of substantial decline and partial recovery.
Significantly, only the leadership of the press and television
news enjoyed more confidence in 1973 than they had in
1966, and only in the case of television was the increase a
substantial and dramatic one. In 1973, the institutional
leaders in which the public had the greatest degree of
confidence were, in declining order of confidence: medicine,
higher education, television news, and the military.

: Table 4 - Trust in the National Government[^t4]

[^t4]: Source: University of Michigan, Center for Political Studies, election surveys.

Question: How much (of the time --- 1958, 1964) do you think we can trust the government
in Washington to do what is right --- just about always, most of the time,
or only some of the time (or almost never --- 1966)?

The late 1960s and early 1970s also saw a significant
decline from the levels of the mid-1960s in the sense of
political efficacy on the part of large numbers of people. In
1966, for instance, 37 percent of the people believed that
what they thought "doesn't count much anymore"; in 1973
a substantial majority of 61 percent of the people believed
this. Similarly, in 1960 42 percent of the American public
scored "high" on a political efficacy index developed by the
Michigan Survey Research Center and only 28 percent of the
population scored "low." By 1968, however, this distribution
had changed dramatically, with 38 percent of the people
scoring "high" and 44 percent of the population scoring
"low."[^3/14] This decline in political efficacy coincided with and
undoubtedly was closely related to the simultaneous decline
in the confidence and trust which people had in government.
As of the early 1970s, however, the full impact of this change
in political efficacy upon the overall level of political
participation had only partially begun to manifest itself.

In terms of traditional theory about the requisites for a
viable democratic polity, these trends of the 1960s thus end
up as a predominantly negative but still mixed report. On the
one side, there is the increasing distrust and loss of confidence
in government, the tendencies towards the polarization of
opinion, and the declining sense of political efficacy. On the
other, there is the early rise in political participation over
previous levels. As we have suggested, these various trends
may well all be interrelated. The increases in participation
first occurred in the 1950s; these were followed by the
polarization over racial, social, and military issues in the
mid-1960s; this, in turn, was followed by the decrease in
confidence and trust in government and individual political
efficacy in the late 1960s. There is reason to believe that this
sequence was not entirely accidental.[^3/15] Those who are active
in politics are likely to have more systematic and consistent
views on political issues, and those who have such views are,
as we have shown above, likely to become alienated if
government action does not reflect their views. This logic
would also suggest that those who are most active politically
should be most dissatisfied with the political system. In the
past, exactly the reverse has been the case: the active political
participants have had highly positive attitudes towards
government and policies. Now, however, this relationship
seems to be weakening, and those who have low trust in
government are no more likely to be politically apathetic
than those with high trust in government.[^3/16]

: Table 5 - Proportion of Public Expressing "Great Deal of Confidence" in Leadership of Institutions[^t5]

[^t5]: Source: Louis Harris and Associates, _Confidence and Concern: Citizens View American Government_. Committee Print, U.S. Senate, Committee on Government Operations, Subcommittee on Inter-governmental Relations, 93rd Congress, 1st Session, December 3, 1973.

Question: As far as people running these institutions are concerned,
would you say you have a great deal of confidence, only
some confidence, or hardly any confidence in them?

The decline in the average citizen's sense of political
efficacy could also produce a decline in levels of political
participation. In fact, the presidential election of 1972 did
see a substantial decline in the level of reported interest in
the election and a leveling off of citizen campaign activity as
compared to the levels in the 1968 election.[^3/17] There is, thus,
some reason to think that there may be cyclical process of
interaction in which:

(1) Increased political participation leads to increased
policy polarization within society;
(2) Increased policy polarization leads to increasing
distrust and a sense of decreasing political efficacy
among individuals;
(3) A sense of decreasing political efficacy leads to
decreased political participation.

In addition, change in the principal issues on the political
agenda could lead to decreasing ideological polarization. The
fire has subsided with respect to many of the heated issues
of the 1960s, and, at the moment, they have been displaced
on the public agenda by overwhelming preoccupation with
economic issues, first inflation and then recession and
unemployment. The positions of people on economic issues,
however, are not as directly related to their basic ideological
inclinations as their positions on other issues. In addition,
inflation and unemployment are like crime; no one is in favor
of them, and significant differences can only appear if there
are significantly different alternative programs for dealing
with them. Such programs, however, have been slow in
materializing; hence, the salience of economic issues may give
rise to generalized feelings of lack of confidence in the
political system but not to dissatisfaction rooted in the
failure of government to follow a particular set of policies.
Such generalized alienation could, in turn, reinforce
tendencies towards political passivity engendered by the
already observable decline in the sense of political efficacy.
This suggests that the democratic surge of the 1960s could
well generate its own countervailing forces, that an upsurge
of political participation produces conditions which favor a
downswing in political participation.

### The Decay of the Party System

The decline in the role of political parties in the United
States in the 1960s can be seen in a variety of ways.

(a) Party identification has dropped sharply, and the
proportion of the public which considers itself Independent
in politics has correspondingly increased. In 1972 more
people identified themselves as Independent than identified
themselves as Republican, and among those under thirty,
there were more Independents than Republicans and
Democrats combined. Younger voters always tend to be less
partisan than older voters. But the proportion of
Independents among this age group has gone up sharply. In
1950, for instance, 28 percent of the twenty-one to twentynine-year-old
group identified themselves as Independent; in
1971, 43 percent of this age group did.[^3/18] Thus, unless there
is a reversal of this trend and a marked upswing in partisanship,
substantially lower levels of party identification among
the American electorate are bound to persist for at least
another generation.
(b) Party voting has declined, and ticket-splitting has
become a major phenomenon. In 1950 about 80 percent of
the voters cast straight party ballots; in 1970 only 50 percent
did.[^3/19] Voters are thus more inclined to vote for the
candidate than to vote for the party, and this, in turn, means
that candidates have to campaign primarily as individuals and
sell themselves to the voters in terms of their own personality
and talents, rather than joining with the other candidates of
their party in a collaborative partisan effort. Hence they must
also raise their own money and create their own organization.
The phenomenon represented at the extreme by CREEP and
its isolation from the Republican National Committee in the
1972 election is being duplicated in greater or lesser measure
in other electoral contests.
(c) Partisan consistency in voting is also decreasing, that is,
voters are more likely to vote Republican in one election and
Democratic in the next. At the national level, there is a
growing tendency for public opinion to swing generally back
and forth across the board, with relatively little regard to the
usual differences among categorical voting groups. Four out
of the six presidential elections since 1952 have been
landslides. This phenomenon is a product of the weakening
of party ties and the decline of regionalism in politics. In
1920 Harding received about the same percentage of the
popular vote that Nixon did in 1972, but Harding lost eleven
states while Nixon lost only Massachusetts and the District of
Columbia.[^3/20] In a similar vein, the fact that the voters cast 60
percent of their votes for Nixon in 1972 did not prevent
them from reelecting a Democratic Congress that year and
then giving the Democrats an even more overwhelming
majority in Congress two years later.

As the above figures suggest, the significance of party as a
guide to electoral behavior has declined substantially. In part,
but only in part, candidate appeal took its place. Even more
important was the rise of issues as a significant factor
affecting voting behavior. Previously, if one wanted to
predict how individuals would vote in a congressional or
presidential election, the most important fact to know about
them was their party identification. This is no longer the
case. In 1956 and 1960, party identification was three or
four times as important as the views of voters on issues in
predicting how they would vote. In the-1964 and subsequent
elections, this relationship reversed itself. Issue politics has
replaced party politics as the primary influence on mass
political behavior.[^3/21] This is true, also, not only with respect
to the public and electoral behavior but also with respect to
members of Congress and legislative behavior. Party is no
longer as significant a guide as it once was to how members
of Congress will vote. In the House of Representatives, for
instance, during Truman's second term (1949--52), 54.5
percent of the roll call votes were party unity votes, in which
a majority of one party opposes a majority of the other
party. This proportion has declined steadily to the point
where in Nixon's first term (1969--72), only 31 percent of the
roll call votes were party unity votes.[^3/22]

The decline in the salience of party for the mass public is
also, in some measure, reflected in the attitudes of the public
toward the parties as institutions. In 1972, the public was
asked which of the four major institutions of the national
government (President,' Congress, Supreme Court, and
political parties) had done the best job and the worst job in
the past few years and which was most powerful and least
powerful. On both dimensions, the differences among the
three formal branches of the national government were, while
clearly observable, not all that great. Not one of the others,
however, came close to the political parties as the voters'
choice for doing the worst job and being the least powerful.
(See Table 6.) While these data could conceivably be
interpreted in a variety of ways, when they are viewed in the
context of the other evidence on the decline of partisan
loyalty, they strongly suggest that the popular attitude
towards parties combines both disapproval and contempt. As
might be expected, these attitudes are particularly marked
among those under twenty-five years of age. In 1973, for
instance, 61 percent of college youth and 64 percent of
noncollege youth believed that political parties needed to be
reformed or to be eliminated; in comparison, 54 percent of
the college youth and 45 percent of the noncollege youth
believed big business needed to be reformed or eliminated.[^3/23]

Questions:

(1) Which of the parts of the government on this list
do you think has done the best (worst) job in the
past couple of years?

(2) Which part of the government on the list would you
say is the most (least) powerful?

Not only has the mass base of the parties declined but so
also has the coherence and strength of party organization.
The political party has, indeed, become less of an
organization, with a life and interest of its own, and more of
an arena in which other actors pursue their interests. In some
respects, of course, the decline of party organization is an old
and familiar phenomenon. The expansion of government
welfare functions beginning with the New Deal, the increased
pervasiveness of the mass media, particularly television, and
the higher levels of affluence and education among the public
have all tended over the years to weaken the traditional bases
of party organization. During the 1960s, however, this trend
seemed to accelerate. In both major parties, party leaders
found it difficult to maintain control of the most central and
important function of the party: the selection of candidates
for public office. In part, the encroachment on party
organization was the result of the mobilization of issue
constituencies by issue-oriented candidates, of whom
Goldwater, McCarthy, Wallace, and McGovern were the
principal examples on the national level. In part, however, it
was simply a reaction against party politics and party leaders.
Endorsements by party leaders or by party conventions
carried little positive weight and were often a liability. The
"outsider" in politics, or the candidate who could make
himself or herself appear to be an ouisider, had the inside
road to political office. In New York in 1974, for instance,
four of five candidates for statewide office endorsed by the
state Democratic convention were defeated by the voters in
the Democratic primary; the party leaders, it has been aptly
said, did not endorse Hugh Carey for governor because he
could not win, and he won because they did not endorse him.
The lesson of the 1960s was that American political parties
were extraordinarily open and extraordinarily vulnerable
organizations, in the sense that they could be easily
penetrated, and even captured, by highly motivated and
well-organized groups with a cause and a candidate.

The trends in party reform and organization in the 1960s
were all designed to open the parties even further and to
encourage fuller participation in party affairs. In some
measure, these reforms could conceivably mitigate the
peculiar paradox in which popular participation in politics
was going up, but the premier organization designed to
structure and organize that participation, the political party,
was declining. At the same time, the longer-term effect of the
reforms could be very different from that which was
intended. In the democratic surge during the Progressive era
at the turn of the century, the direct primary was widely
adopted as a means of insuring popular control of the party
organization. In fact, however, the primary reinforced the
power of the political bosses whose followers in the party
machine always voted in the primaries. In similar fashion, the
reforms of the 1970s within the Democratic party to insure
the representation of all significant groups and viewpoints in
party conventions appeared likely to give the party leaders at
the national convention new influence over the choice of the
presidential nominee.

As we have indicated, the signs of decay in the American
party system have their parallels in the party systems of other
industrialized democratic countries. In addition, however, the
developments of the 1960s in the American party system can
also be viewed in terms of the historical dynamics of
American politics. According to the standard theory of
American politics, a major party realignment occurs, usually
in conjunction with a "critical election," approximately
every twenty-eight to thirty-six years: 1800, 1828, 1860,
1898, 1932.[^3/24] In terms of this theory, such a realignment
was obviously due about 1968. In fact, many of the signs of
party decay which were present in the 1960s have also
historically accompanied major party realignments: a decline
in party identification, increased electoral volatility, third
party movements, the loosening of the bonds between social
groups and political parties, and the rise of new policy issues
which cut across the older cleavages. The decay of the old
New Deal party system was clearly visible, and the emergence
of a new party system was eagerly awaited, at least by
politicians and political analysts. Yet neither in 1968 nor in
1972 did a new coalition of groups emerge to constitute a
new partisan majority and give birth to a new party
alignment. Nor did there seem to be any significant evidence
that such a realignment was likely in 1976 --- by which time it
would be eight to sixteen years overdue according to the
"normal" pattern of party system evolution.

Alternatively, the signs of party decomposition could be
interpreted as presaging not simply a realignment of parties
within an ongoing system but rather a more fundamental
decay and potential dissolution of the party system. In this
respect, it could be argued that the American party system
emerged during the Jacksonian years of the mid-nineteenth
century, that it went through realignments in the 1850s,
1890s, and 1930s, but that it reached its peak in terms of
popular commitment and organizational strength in the last
decades of the nineteenth century, and that since then it has
been going through a slow, but now accelerating, process of
disintegration. To support this proposition, it could be
argued that political parties are a political form peculiarly
suited to the needs of industrial society and that the
movement of the United States into a post-industrial phase
hence means the end of the political party system as we have
known it. If this be the case, a variety of critical issues must
be faced. Is democratic government possible without political
parties? If political participation is not organized by means of
parties, how will it be organized? If parties decline, will not
popular participation also drop significantly? In less
developed countries, the principal alternative to party
government is military government. Do the highly developed
countries have a third alternative?

### The Shifting Balance Between Government and Opposition

The governability of a democracy depends upon the
relation between the authority of its governing institutions
and the power of its opposition institutions. In a
parliamentary system, the authority of the cabinet depends
upon the balance of power between the governing parties and
the opposition parties in the legislature. In the United States,
the authority of government depends upon the balance of
power between a broad coalition of governing institutions
and groups, which includes but transcends the legislature and
other formal institutions of government, and the power of
those institutions and groups which are committed to
opposition. During the 1960s the balance of power between
government and opposition shifted significantly. The central
governing institution in the political system, the presidency,
declined in power; institutions playing opposition roles in the
system, most notably the national media and Congress,
significantly increased their power.

"Who governs?" is obviously one of the most important
questions to ask concerning any political system. Even more
important, however, may be the question: "Does anybody
govern?" To the extent that the United States was governed
by anyone during the decades after World War II, it was
governed by the president acting with the support and
cooperation of key individuals and groups in the Executive
Office, the federal bureaucracy, Congress, and the more
important businesses, banks, law firms, foundations, and
media, which constitute the private establishment. In the
twentieth century, when the American political system has
moved systematically with respect to public policy, the
direction and the initiative have come from the White House.
When the president is unable to exercise authority, when he
is unable to command the cooperation of key decisionmakers
elsewhere in society and government, no one else has
been able to supply comparable purpose and initiative. To
the extent that the United States has been governed on a
national basis, it has been governed by the president. During
the 1960s and early 1970s, however, the authority of the
president declined significantly, and the governing coalition
which had, in effect, helped the president to run the country
from the early 1940s down to the early 1960s began to
disintegrate.

These developments were, in some measure, a result of the
extent to which all forms of leadership, but particularly those
associated with or tainted by politics, tended to lose
legitimacy in the 1960s and early 1970s. Not only was there
a decline in the confidence of the public in political leaders,
but there was also a marked decline in the confidence of
political leaders in themselves. In part, this was the result of
what were perceived to be significant policy failures: the
failure "to win" the war in Indochina; the failure of the
Great Society's social programs to achieve their anticipated
results; and the intractability of inflation. These perceived
failures induced doubts among political leaders of the
effectiveness of their rule. In addition, and probably more
importantly, political leaders also had doubts about the
morality of their rule. They too shared in the democratic,
participatory, and egalitarian ethos of the times, and hence
had questions about the legitimacy of hierarchy, coercion,
discipline, secrecy, and deception --- all of which are, in some
measure, inescapable attributes of the process of government.[^3/s4]

Probably no development of the 1960s and 1970s has
greater import for the future of American politics than the
decline in the authority, status, influence, and effectiveness
of the presidency. The effects of the weakening of the
presidency will be felt throughout the body politic for years
to come. The decline of the presidency manifests itself in a
variety of ways.

No one of the last four presidents has served a full course
of eight years in office. One President has been assasinated,
one forced out of office because of opposition to his policies,
and another forced out because of opposition to him
personally. Short terms in office reduce the effectiveness of
the president in dealing with both enemies and allies abroad
and bureaucrats and members of Congress at home. The
greatest weakness in the presidency in American history was
during the period from 1848 to 1860, during which twelve
years four presidents occupied the office and none of them
was reelected.

[^3/s4]: And also, as my colleague Sidney Verba comments at this point, one
must not forget that "disorder, distrust of authority, difficulties in
reconciling competing claims on the government, conflict among
governmental branches, and yelling from the back of the room at city
council meetings are in some measure inescapable attributes of
democratic government."

At present, for the first time since the Jacksonian
revolution, the United States has a president and a vicepresident
who are not the product of a national electoral
process. Both the legitimacy and the power of the presidency
are weakened to the extent that the president does not come
into office through an involvement in national politics which
compels him to mobilize support throughout the country,
negotiate alliances with diverse economic, ethnic, and regional
groups and defeat his adversaries in intensely fought state
and national electoral battles. The current president is a
product of Grand Rapids and the House --- not of the nation.
The United States has almost returned, at least temporarily,
to the relations between Congress and president which
prevailed during the congressional caucus period in the
second decade of the nineteenth century.

Since Theodore Roosevelt, at least, the presidency has
been viewed as the most popular branch of government and
that which is most likely to provide the leadership for
progressive reform. Liberals, progressives, intellectuals have
all seen the presidency as the key to change in American
politics, economics, and society. The great presidents have
been the strong presidents, who stretched the legal authority
and political resources of the office to mobilize support for
their policies and to put through their legislative program. In
the 1960s, however, the tide of opinion dramatically reversed
itself: those who previously glorified presidential leadership
now warn of the dangers of presidential power.

While much was made in the press and elsewhere during
the 1960s about the dangers of the abuses of presidential
power, this criticism of presidential power was, in many
respects, evidence of the decline of presidential power.
Certainly the image which both Presidents Johnson and
Nixon had of their power was far different, and probably
more accurate, if only because it was self-fulfilling, than the
images which the critics of the presidency had of presidential
power. Both Johnson and Nixon saw themselves as isolated
and beleaguered, surrounded by hostile forces in the
bureaucracy and the establishment. Under both of them, a
feeling almost of political paranoia pervaded the White
House: a sense that the president and his staff were "an
island" in a hostile world. On the one hand, these feelings of
suspicion and mistrust led members of the president's staff to
engage in reckless, illegal, and self-defeating actions to
counter his "enemies"; on the other hand, these feelings also
made it all the more difficult for them to engage in the
political compromises and to exercise the political leadership
necessary to mobilize his supporters.

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Congress and the
courts began to impose a variety of formal restrictions on
presidential power, in the form of the War Powers Act, the
budgetary reform act, the limits on presidential impoundment
of funds, and similar measures.

At the same time, and more importantly, the effectiveness
of the president as the principal leader of the nation declined
also as a result of the decline in the effectiveness of
leadership at other levels in society and government. The
absence of strong central leadership in Congress (on the
Rayburn-Johnson model, for instance, made it impossible for
a president to secure support from Congress in an economical
fashion. The diffusion of authority in Congress meant a
reduction in the authority of the president. There was rio
central leadership with whom he could negotiate and come to
terms. The same was true with respect to the cabinet. The
general decline in the status of cabinet secretaries was often
cited as evidence of the growth in the power of the
presidency on the grounds that the White House office was
assuming powers which previously rested with the cabinet.
But in fact the decline in the status of cabinet secretaries
made it more difficult for the president to command the
support and cooperation of the executive bureaucracy; weak
leadership at the departmental level produces weakened
leadership at the presidential level.

To become president a candidate has to put together an
electoral coalition involving majority of voters
appropriately distributed across the country. He normally
does this by: (1) developing an identification with certain
issues and positions which bring him the support of key
categorical groups --- economic, regional, ethnic, racial, and
religious; and (2) cultivating the appearance of certain general
characteristics --- honesty, energy, practicality, decisiveness,
sincerity, and experience --- which appeal generally across the
board to people in all categorical groups. Before the New
Deal, when the needs of the national government in terms of
policies, programs, and personnel were relatively small, the
president normally relied on the members of his electoral
coalition to help him govern the country. Political leaders in
Congress, in the state houses, and elsewhere across the
country showed up in Washington to run the administration,
and the groups which comprised the electoral coalition acted
to put through Congress the measures in which they were
interested.

Since the 1930s, however, the demands on government
have grown tremendously and the problems of constituting a
governing coalition have multiplied commensurately. Indeed,
once he is elected president, the president's electoral
coalition has, in a sense, served its purpose. The day after his
election the size of his majority is almost-if not entirelyirrelevant
to his ability to govern the country. What counts
then is his ability to govern the country. What counts then is
his ability to mobilize support from the leaders of the key
institutions in society and government. He has to constitute a
broad governing coalition of strategically located supporters
who can furnish him with the information, talent, expertise,
workforce, publicity, arguments, and political support which
he needs to develop a program, to embody it in legislation,
and to see it effectively implemented. This coalition, as we
have indicated, must include key people in Congress, the
executive branch, and the private establishment. The governing
coalition need have little relation to the electoral
coalition. The fact that the president as a candidate put
together a successful electoral coalition does not insure that
he will have a viable governing coalition.

For twenty years after World War II presidents operated
with the cooperation of a series of informal governing
coalitions. Truman made a point of bringing a substantial
number of nonpartisan soldiers, Republican bankers, and
Wall Street lawyers into his administration. He went to the
existing sources of power in the country to get the help he
needed in ruling the country. Eisenhower in part inherited
this coalition and was in part almost its creation. He also
mobilized a substantial number of midwestern businessmen
into his administration and established close and effective
working relationships with the Democratic leadership of
Congress. During his brief administration, Kennedy
attempted to recreate a somewhat similar structure of
alliances. Johnson was acutely aware of the need to maintain
effective working relations with the Eastern establishment
and other key groups in the private sector, but, in effect, in
1965 and 1966 was successful only with respect to Congress.
The informal coalition of individuals and groups which had
buttressed the power of the three previous presidents began
to disintegrate.

Both Johnson and his successor were viewed with a certain
degree of suspicion by many of the more liberal and
intellectual elements which might normally contribute their
support to the administration. The Vietnam war and, to a
lesser degree, racial issues divided elite groups as well as the
mass public. In addition, the number and variety of groups
whose support might be necessary had increased
tremendously by the 1960s. Truman had been able to govern
the country with the cooperation of a relatively small
number of Wall Street lawyers and bankers. By the
mid-1960s, the sources of power in society had diversified
tremendously, and this was no longer possible.

The most notable new source of national power in 1970,
as compared to 1950, was the national media, meaning here
the national TV networks, the national news magazines, and
the major newspapers with national reach such as the
_Washington Post_ and the _New York Times_.[^3/s5] There is, for
instance, considerable evidence to suggest that the development
of television journalism contributed to the undermining
of governmental authority. The advent of the half-hour
nightly news broadcast in 1963 led to greatly increased
popular dependence on television as a source of news. It also
greatly expanded the size of the audience for news. At the
same time, the themes which were stressed, the focus on
controversy and violence, and, conceivably, the values and
outlook of the journalists, tended to arouse unfavorable
attitudes towards established institutions and to promote a
decline in confidence in government. "Most newsmen,
Walter Cronkite put it, "come to feel very little allegiance to
the established order. I think they are inclined to side with
humanity rather than with authority and institutions."[^3/25]
And, in fact, public opinion surveys show that, even with
controls for education and income, increased reliance on
television for news is associated with low political efficacy,
social distrust, cynicism, and weak party loyalty.[^3/26] Television
news, in short, functions as a "dispatriating" agencyone
which portrays the conditions in society as undesirable
and as getting worse. In the 1960s, the network organizations,
as one analyst put it, became "a highly creditable,
never-tiring political opposition, a maverick third party which
never need face the sobering experience of governing."[^3/27]

[^3/s5]: Suggestive of the new power relationships between government and
media were the responses of 490 leading Americans when asked to rate
a number of public and private institutions according to "the amount
of influence" they had "on decisions or actions affecting the nation as a
whole." Television came in a clear first, well ahead of the president, and
newspapers edged out both houses of Congress. The average ratings, on
a scale from 1 (lowest influence) to 10 (highest influence), were:

    +------+-------------------------------+--------+
    | Rank | Institution                   | Rating |
    +======+===============================+=======:+
    | 1    | Television                    | 7.2    |

Less dramatic but somewhat parallel changes also occurred
in the political role of newspapers. It is a long-established and
familiar political fact that within a city and even within a
state, the power of the local press serves as a major check on
the power of the local government. In the early twentieth
century, the United States developed an effective national
government, making and implementing national policies.
Only in recent years, however, has there come into existence
a national press with the economic independence and
communications reach to play a role with respect to the
president that a local newspaper plays with respect to a
mayor. This marks the emergence of a very significant check
on presidential power. In the two most dramatic domestic
policy conflicts of the Nixon administration --- the Pentagon
Papers and Watergate --- organs of the national media
challenged and defeated the national executive. The press,
indeed, played a leading role in bringing about what no other
single institution, group, or combination of institutions and
groups, had done previously in American history: forcing out
of office a president who had been elected less than two
years earlier by one of the largest popular majorities in
American history. No future president can or will forget that
fact.

The 1960s and early 1970s also saw a reassertion of the
power of Congress. In part, this represented simply the latest
phase in the institutionalized constitutional conflict between
Congress and president; in part, also, of course, it reflected
the fact that after 1968 president and Congress were
controlled by different parties. In addition, however, these
years saw the emergence, first in the Senate and then in the
House, of a new generation of congressional activists willing
to challenge established authority in their own chambers as
well as in the presidency.

The new power of the media and the new assertiveness of
Congress also had their impact on the relations between the
executive branch and the president. During the Johnson and
Nixon administrations the White House attitude toward
executive branch agencies often seemed to combine mistrust
of them, on the one hand, and the attempt to misuse them,
on the other. Iņ part, no doubt, the poisoning of the relationship
between White House and executive agencies reflected
the fact that not since Franklin Roosevelt has this country
had a chief executive with any significant experience as a
political executive. The record to date of former legislators
and generals in the presidency suggests they do not come to
that office well equipped to motivate, energize, guide, and
control their theoretical subordinates but actual rivals in the
executive branch agencies. The growth in the power of the
press and of Congress inevitably strengthens the independence
of bureaucratic agencies vis-à-vis the president. Those
agencies are secondary contributors to the decline of presidential
power but primary beneficiaries of that decline.

The increased power of the national opposition, centered
in the press and in Congress, undoubtedly is related to and is
perhaps a significant cause of the critical attitudes which the
public has towards the federal as compared to state and local
government. While data for past periods are not readily
available, certainly the impression one gets is that over the
years the public has often tended to view state and local
government as inefficient, corrupt, inactive, and
unresponsive. The federal government, on the other hand, has
seemed to command much greater confidence and trust,
going all the way from early childhood images of the
"goodness" of the president to respect for the FBI, Internal
Revenue Service and other federal agencies having an impact
on the population as models of efficiency and integrity. It
would now appear that there has been a drastic reversal of
these images. In 1973, a national sample was asked whether it
then had more or less confidence in each of the three levels
of government than it had five years previously. Confidence
in all three levels of government declined more than it rose,
but the proportion of the public which reported a decline in
confidence in the federal government (57 percent) was far
higher than those reporting a decline in confidence in state
(26 percent) or local (30 percent) government. Corroborating
these judgements, only 11 percent and 14 percent, respectively,
thought that local and state government had made
their life worse during the past few years, while 28 percent
and 27 percent of the population thought that local and state
government had improved their life. In contrast, only 23 percent
of the population thought that the federal government
had improved their lives, while a whopping 37 percent thought it
had made their lives worse. As one would expect, substantial
majorities also went on record in favor of increasing the
power of state government (59 percent) and of local government
(61 percent). But only 32 percent wanted to increase
the power of the federal government, while 42 percent voted
to decrease its power.[^3/28] The shift in the institutional balance
between government and opposition at the national level thus
corresponds neatly to the shift in popular attitudes towards
government at the national level.

The balance between government and opposition depends
not only on the relative power of different institutions, but
also on their roles in the political system. The presidency has
been the principal national governing institution in the
United States; its power has declined. The power of the
media and of Congress has increased. Can their roles change?
By its very nature, the media cannot govern and has strong
incentives to assume an oppositional role. The critical
question consequently concerns Congress. In the wake of a
declining presidency, can Congress organize itself to furnish
the leadership to govern the country? During most of this
century, the trends in Congress have been in the opposite
direction. In recent years the increase in the power of
Congress has outstripped an increase in its ability to govern.[^3/s6]
If the institutional balance is to be redressed between
government and opposition, the decline in presidential power
has to be reversed and the ability of Congress to govern has
to be increased.

## THE DEMOCRATIC DISTEMPER: CONSEQUENCES

The vigor of democracy in the United States in the 1960s
thus contributed to a democratic distemper, involving the
expansion of governmental activity, on the one hand, and the
reduction of governmental authority, on the other. This
democratic distemper, in turn, had further important
consequences for the functioning of the political system. The
extent of these consequences was, as of 1974, still unclear,
depending, obviously, on the duration and the scope of the
democratic surge.

[^3/s6]: There are, it might be noted, some parallels between Congress and the
Communist parties in Europe, as described by Michel Crozier. Both
have long been accustomed to playing opposition roles; with the decline
in authority and power of other groups, the power of both these
institutions is increasing; and one crucial question for the future-and
governability-of democracy in Italy, France, and the United States is
whether these oppositional bodies can adapt themselves to play
responsible governing roles. Professor Crozier appears to be somewhat
more optimistic about the European communists in this respect than I
am about the American Congress at this moment in time.

The expansion of governmental activity produced
budgetary deficits and a major expansion of total
governmental debt from $336 billion in 1960 to $557 billion
in 1971. These deficits contributed to inflationary tendencies
in the economy. They also brought to the fore in the early
1970s the entire question of the incidence of the tax burden
and the issues of tax reform. The major expansion of
unionism in the public sector combined with the difficulty, if
not the impossibility, of measuring productivity or efficiency
for many bureaucratic activities made the salary and wage
determinations for governmental employee's a central focus
of political controversy. Unionization produced higher wages
and more vigorous collective bargaining to secure higher
wages. Strikes by public employees became more and more
prevalent: in 1961, only twenty-eight strikes took place
involving governmental workers; in 1970, there were 412
such strikes.[^3/29] Governmental officials were thus caught
between the need to avoid the disruption of public services
from strikes by governmental employees for higher wages and
the need to avoid imposing higher taxes to pay for the higher
wages which the governmental employees demand. The
easiest and obviously most prevalent way of escaping from
this dilemma is to increase wages without increasing taxes
and thereby to add still further to governmental deficits and
to the inflationary spiral which will serve as the justification
for demands for still higher wages. To the extent that this
process is accompanied by low or negative rates of economic
growth, tax revenues will be still further limited and the
whole vicious cycle still further exacerbated.

At the same time that the expansion of governmental
activity creates problems of financial solvency for
government, the decline in governmental authority reduces
still further the ability of government to deal effectively with
these problems. The imposition of "hard" decisions imposing
constraints on any major economic group is difficult in any
democracy and particularly difficult in the United States
where the separation of powers provides a variety of points
of access to governmental decision-making for economic
interest groups. During the Korean war, for instance,
governmental efforts at wage and price control failed
miserably, as business and farm groups were able to riddle
legislation with loopholes in Congress and labor was able to
use its leverage with the executive branch to eviscerate wage
controls.[^3/30] All this occurred despite the fact that there was a
war on and the government was not lacking in authority. The
decline in governmental authority in general and of the
central leadership in particular during the early 1970s opens
new opportunities to special interests to bend governmental
behavior to their special purposes.

In the United States, as elsewhere in the industrialized
world, domestic problems thus become intractable problems.
The public develops expectations which it is impossible for
government to meet. The activities --- and expenditures --- of
government expand, but the success of government in
achieving its goals seems dubious. In a democracy, however,
political leaders in power need to score successes if they are
going to stay in power. The natural result is to produce a
gravitation to foreign policy, where successes, or seeming
successes, are much more easily arranged than they are in
domestic policy. Trips abroad, summit meetings, declarations
and treaties, rhetorical aggression, all produce the appearance
of activity and achievement. The weaker a political leader is
at home, the more likely he is to be traveling abroad. Nixon
had to see Brezhnev in June 1974, and Tanaka, for similar
reasons, desperately wanted to see Ford in September 1974.
Despite the best efforts by political leaders to prop each
other up at critical moments, there remains, nonetheless,
only limited room for substantive agreements among nations
among whom there are complex and conflicting interests.
Consequently, politicians in search of bolstering their
standing at home by achievements abroad either have to
make a nonachievement appear to be an achievement (which
can be done successfully only a limited number of times), or
they have to make an achievement which may have an
immediate payoff but which they and, more importantly,
their countries are likely to regret in the long run. The
dynamics of this search for foreign policy achievements by
democratic leaders lacking authority at home gives to
dictatorships (whether communist party states or oil
sheikhdoms), which are free from such compulsions, a major
advantage in the conduct of international relations.

The expansion of expenditures and the decrease in
authority are also likely to encourage economic nationalism
in democratic societies. Each country will have an interest in
minimizing the export of some goods in order to keep prices
down in its own society. At the same time, other interests are
likely to demand protection against the import of foreign
goods. In the United States, this has meant embargoes, as on
the export of soybeans, on the one hand, and tariffs and
quotas on the import of textiles, shoes, and comparable
manufactured goods, on the other. A strong government will
not necessarily follow more liberal and internationalist
economic policies, but a weak government is almost certain
to be incapable of doing so. The resulting unilateralism could
well weaken still further the alliances among the Trilateral
countries and increase their vulnerability to economic and
military pressures from the Soviet bloc.

Finally, a government which lacks authority and which is
committed to substantial domestic programs will have little
ability, short of a cataclysmic crisis, to impose on its people
the sacrifices which may be necessary to deal with foreign
policy problems and defense. In the early 1970s, as we have
seen, spending for all significant programs connected with the
latter purposes was far more unpopular than spending for any
major domestic purpose. The U.S. government has given up
the authority to draft its citizens into the armed forces and is
now committed to providing the monetary incentives to
attract volunteers with a stationary or declining percentage of
the Gross National Product. At the present time, this would
appear to pose no immediate deleterious consequences for
national security. The question necessarily arises, however,
of whether in the future, if a new threat to security should
materialize, as it inevitably will at some point, the government
will possess the authority to command the resources
and the sacrifices necessary to meet that threat.

The implications of these potential consequences of the
democratic distemper extend far beyond the United States.
For a quarter-century the United States was the hegemonic
power in a system of world order. The manifestations of the
democratic distemper, however, have already stimulated
uncertainty among allies and could well stimulate adventurism
among enemies. If American citizens don't trust their
government, why should friendly foreigners? If American
citizens challenge the authority of American government,
why shouldn't unfriendly governments? The turning inward
of American attention and the decline in the authority of
American governing institutions are closely related, as both
cause and effect, to the relative downturn in American power
and influence in world affairs. A decline in the governability
of democracy at home means a decline in the influence of
democracy abroad.

## THE DEMOCRATIC DISTEMPER: CAUSES

The immediate causes of the simultaneous expansion of
governmental activity and the decline of governmental
authority are to be found in the democratic surge of the
1960s. What, however, was in turn responsible for this sharp
increase in political consciousness, political participation, and
commitment to egalitarian and democratic values? As we
have indicated, the causes of the surge can be usefully
analyzed in terms of their scope and timing. Are these causes
country-specific or Trilateral-general? Are they transitory,
secular, or recurring? In actuality, as we have suggested, the
causes of the democratic surge seem to partake of all these
characteristics.

The most specific, immediate, and in a sense "rational"
causes of the democratic surge could conceivably be the
specific policy problems confronting the United States
government in the 1960s and 1970s and its inability to deal
effectively with those problems. Vietnam, race relations,
Watergate, and stagflation: these could quite naturally lead to
increased polarization over policy, higher levels of political
participation (and protest), and reduced confidence in
governmental institutions and leaders. In fact, these issues
and the ways in which the government dealt with them did
have some impact; the unraveling of Watergate was, for
instance, followed by a significant decline in public
confidence in the executive branch of government. More
generally, however, a far-from-perfect fit exists between the
perceived inability of the government to deal effectively with
these policy problems and the various attitudinal and
behavioral manifestations of the democratic surge. The
expansion of political participation was underway long
before these problems came to a head in the mid-1960s, and
the beginnings of the decline in trust and of the increase in
attitude consistency go back before large-scale American
involvement in Vietnam. Indeed, a closer look at the
relationship between attitudes towards the Vietnam war and
confidence in government suggests that the connection
between the two may not be very significant. Opposition to
U.S. involvement in Vietnam, for instance, became
widespread among blacks in mid-1966, while among whites
opponents of the war did not outnumber supporters until
early 1968. In terms of a variety of indices, however, white
confidence and trust in government declined much further
and more rapidly than black confidence and trust during the
middle 1960s. In late 1967, for instance, whites were divided
roughly 46 percent in favor of the war and 44 percent
against, while blacks were split 29 percent in favor and 57
percent against. Yet in 1968, white opinion was divided 49.2
percent to 40.5 percent on whether the government was run
for the benefit of all or a "few big interests," while blacks
though that it was run for the benefit of all by a margin of
63.1 percent to 28.6 percent.[^3/31] Black confidence in
government plummeted only after the Nixon administration
came to power in 1969. While the evidence is not as
complete as one would desire, it does, nonetheless, suggest
that the actual substantive character of governmental policies
on the war, as well as perhaps on other matters, was of less
significance for the decrease in governmental authority than
were the changes generated by other causes in the attitudes
of social groups towards government and in the intensity
with which social groups held to particular political values.

At the opposite extreme in terms of generality, the
democratic surge can also be explained in terms of
widespread demographic trends of the 1960s. Throughout
the industrialized world during the 1960s, the younger age
cohorts furnished many of the activists in the democratic and
egalitarian challenges to established authority. In part, this
revolt of the youth was undoubtedly the product of the
global baby boom of the post-World War II years which
brought to the fore in the 1960s a generational bulge which
overwhelmed colleges and universities. This was associated
with the rise of distinctive new values which appeared first
among college youth and then were diffused among youth
generally. Prominent among these new values were what have
been described as "changes in relation to the authority of
institutions such as the authority of the law, the police, the
government, the boss in the work situation." These changes
were "in the direction of what sociologists call 'deauthorization,'
i.e., a lessening of automatic obedience to,
and respect for, established authority. ..." The new
disrespect for authority on the part of youth was part and
parcel of broader changes in their attitudes and values with
respect to sexual morality, religion as a source of moral
guidance, and traditional patriotism and allegiance "to my
country right or wrong."[^3/32]

As a result of this development, major differences over
social values and political attitudes emerged between
generations. One significant manifestation of the appearance
of this generational gap in the United States is the proportion
of different age groups agreeing at different times in recent
decades with the proposition: "Voting is the only way that
people like me can have any say about how the government
runs things." In 1952 overwhelming majorities of all age
groups agreed with this statement, with the difference
between the youngest age group (twenty-one to
twenty-eight), with 79 percent approval, and the oldest age
group (sixty-one and over), with 80 percent approval, being
only 1 percent. By 1968, the proportion of every age group
supporting the statement had declined substantially. Of even
greater significance was the major gap of 25 percent which
had opened up between the youngest age group (37 percent
approval) and the oldest age group (62 percent approval).[^3/33]
Whereas young and old related almost identically to political
participation in 1952, they had very different attitudes
toward it sixteen years later.

The democratic surge can also be explained as the first
manifestation in the United States of the political impact of
the social, economic, and cultural trends towards the
emergence of a post-industrial society. Rising levels of
affluence and education lead to changes in political attitudes
and political behavior. Many of the political and social values
which are more likely to be found among the young than
among the elderly are also more likely to be found among
better-off, white-collar, suburban groups than among the
poorer, working-class, blue-collar groups in central and
industrial cities. The former groups, however, are growing in
numbers and importance relative to the latter, and hence
their political attitudes and behavior patterns are likely to
play an increasingly dominant role in politics.[^3/34] What is true
today in North America is likely to be true tomorrow in
Western Europe and Japan.

The single most important status variable affecting
political participation and attitudes is education. For several
decades the level of education in the United States has been
rising rapidly. In 1940, less than 40 percent of the population
was educated beyond elementary school; in 1972, 75 percent
of the population had been either to high school (40
percent) or to college (35 percent). The more educated a person
is, the more likely he is to participate in politics, to have
a more consistent and more ideological outlook on political
issues, and to hold more "enlightened" or "liberal" or
"change oriented" views on social, cultural, and foreign
policy issues. Consequently the democratic surge could be
simply the reflection of a more highly educated populace.

This explanation, however, runs into difficulties when it is
examined more closely. Verba and Nie, for instance, have
shown that the actual rates of campaign activity which
prevailed in the 1950s and 1960s ran far ahead of the rates
which would have been projected simply as a result of
changes in the educational composition of the population.
(See Table 7.) In part, the explanation for this discrepancy
stems from the tremendous increase in black political
participation during these years. Before 1960, blacks
participated less than would have been expected in terms of
their educational levels. After 1960, they participated far
more than would have been expected by those levels; the gap
between projected and actual participation rates in these
latter years being far greater for the blacks than it was for the
whites. The difference in participation between more highly
educated and less highly educated blacks, in turn, was much
less than it was between more highly educated and less highly
educated whites. Black political participation, in short, was
the product primarily not of increased individual status but
rather of increased group consciousness.[^3/35] That political
participation will remain high as long as their group
consciousness does. A decline in the saliency of school
integration, welfare programs, law enforcement, and other
issues of special concern to blacks will at some point
presumably be accompanied by a decline in their group
consciousness and hence their political participation.

In a similar vein, the assumption that increased attitude
consistency can be explained primarily by higher levels of
education also does not hold up. In fact, during the 1950s
and 1960s major and roughly equal increases in attitude
consistency occurred among both those who had gone to
college and those who had not graduated from high school.
In summarizing the data, Nie and Anderson state:

>The growth of attitude consistency within the mass
public is clearly not the result of increases in the
population's "ideological capacities" brought about by
gains in educational attainment. ... Those with the
lowest educational attainment have experienced the
largest increases in consistency on the core domestic
issues; and little significant difference appears to be
present between the two educational groups in
comparison to the dramatic increases in consistency
which both groups have experienced.

Instead, they argue, the increase in ideological thinking is
primarily the result of the increased salience which citizens
perceive politics to have for their own immediate concerns:
"The political events of the last decade, and the crisis
atmosphere which has attended them, have caused citizens to
perceive politics as increasingly central to their lives."[^3/36]
Thus, the causes of increased attitude consistency, like the
causes of higher political participation, are to be found in
changing political relationships, rather than in changes in
individual background characteristics.

All this suggests that a full explanation of the democratic
surge can be found neither in transitory events nor in secular
social trends common to all industrial societies. The timing
and nature of the surge in the United States also need to be
explained by the distinctive dynamics of the American political
process and, in particular, by the interaction between
political ideas and institutional reality in the United States.
The roots of the surge are to be found in the basic American
value system and the degree of commitment which groups in
society feel toward that value system. Unlike Japanese and
most European societies, American society is characterized
by a broad consensus on democratic, liberal, egalitarian
values. For much of the time, the commitment to these
values is neither passionate nor intense. During periods of
rapid social change, however, these democratic and egalitarian
values of the American creed are reaffirmed. The intensity
of belief during such creedal passion periods leads to
the challenging of established authority and to major efforts
to change governmental structure to accord more fully with
those values. In this respect, the democratic surge of the
1960s shares many characteristics with the comparable egalitarian
and reform movements of the Jacksonian and Progressive
eras. Those "surges" like the contemporary one also
occurred during periods of realignment between party and
governmental institutions, on the one hand, and social forces,
on the other.[^3/37] The slogans, goals, values, and targets of all
three movements are strikingly similar. To the extent this
analysis is valid, the causes of the democratic surge in the
United States would be specific to the United States and
limited in duration but potentially recurring at some point in
the future.

## CONCLUSIONS: TOWARD A DEMOCRATIC BALANCE

Predictively, the implication of this analysis is that in due
course the democratic surge and its resulting dual distemper
in government will moderate. Prescriptively, the implication
is that these developments ought to take place in order to
avoid the deleterious consequences of the surge and to
restore balance between vitality and governability in the
democratic system.

Al Smith once remarked that "the only cure for the evils
of democracy is more democracy." Our analysis suggests that
applying that cure at the present time could well be adding
fuel to the flames. Instead, some of the problems of
governance in the United States today stem from an excess of
democracy --- an "excess of democracy" in much the same
sense in which David Donald used the term to refer to the
consequences of the Jacksonian revolution which helped to
precipitate the Civil War. Needed, instead, is a greater degree
of moderation in democracy.

In practice, this moderation has two major areas of
application. First, democracy is only one way of constituting
authority, and it is not necessarily a universally applicable
one. In many situations the claims of expertise, seniority,
experience, and special talents may override the claims of
democracy as a way of constituting authority. During the
surge of the 1960s, however, the democratic principle was
extended to many institutions where it can, in the long run,
only frustrate the purposes of those institutions. A university
where teaching appointments are subject to approval by
students may be a more democratic university but it is not
likely to be a better university. In similar fashion, armies in
which the commands of officers have been subject to veto by
the collective wisdom of their subordinates have almost invariably
come to disaster on the battlefield. The arenas where
democratic procedures are appropriate are, in short, limited.

Second, the effective operation of a democratic political
system usually requires some measure of apathy and
noninvolvement on the part of some individuals and groups.
In the past, every democratic society has had a marginal
population, of greater or lesser size, which has not actively
participated in politics. In itself, this marginality on the part
of some groups is inherently undemocratic, but it has also
been one of the factors which has enabled democracy to
function effectively. Marginal social groups, as in the case of
the blacks, are now becoming full participants in the political
system. Yet the danger of overloading the political system
with demands which extend its functions and undermine its
authority still remains. Less marginality on the part of some
groups thus needs to be replaced by more self-restraint on the
part of all groups.

The Greek philosophers argued that the best practical state
would combine several different principles of government in
its constitution. The Constitution of 1787 was drafted with
this insight very much in mind. Over the years, however, the
American political system has emerged as a distinctive case of
extraordinarily democratic institutions joined to an
exclusively democratic value system. Democracy is more of a
threat to itself in the United States than it is in either Europe
or Japan where there still exist residual inheritances of
traditional and aristocratic values. The absence of such values
in the United States produces a lack of balance in society
which, in turn, leads to the swing back and forth between
creedal passion and creedal passivity. Political authority is
never strong in the United States, and it is peculiarly weak
during a creedal passion period of intense commitment to
democratic and egalitarian ideals. In the United States, the
strength of democracy poses a problem for the governability
of democracy in a way which is not the case elsewhere.

The vulnerability of democratic government in the United
States thus comes not primarily from external threats,
though such threats are real, nor from internal subversion
from the left or the right, although both possibilities could
exist, but rather from the internal dynamics of democracy
itself in a highly educated, mobilized, and participant society.
"Democracy never lasts long," John Adams observed. "It
soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a
democracy yet that did not commit suicide." That suicide is
more likely to be the product of overindulgence than of any
other cause. A value which is normally good in itself is not
necessarily optimized when it is maximized. We have come to
recognize that there are potentially desirable limits to economic
growth. There are also potentially desirable limits to
the indefinite extension of political democracy. Democracy
will have a longer life if it has a more balanced existence.
