# WESTERN EUROPE by Michel Crozier

## ARE EUROPEAN DEMOCRACIES BECOMING UNGOVERNABLE?

The vague and persistent feeling that democracies have
become ungovernable has been growing steadily in Western
Europe. The case of Britain has become the most dramatic
example of this malaise, not because it is the worst example
but because Britain, which had escaped all the vagaries of
continental politics, had always been considered everywhere
as the mother and the model of democratic processes. Its
contemporary troubles seem to announce the collapse of
these democratic processes or at least their incapacity to
answer the challenges of modern times.

Certainly appearances remain safe in most West European
countries but almost everywhere governing coalitions are
weak and vulnerable while alternative coalitions seem to be as
weak and possibly even more contradictory. At the same
time decisions have to be taken whose consequences may be
far-reaching while the governing processes, because of the
conjunction of contradictory pressures, seem to be capable of
producing only erratic results.

These difficulties are compounded by the existence of
Europe as a problem. The whirlpool of each national
governing system has more and more restrained the margin of
freedom on which progress in European unification can be
built. The European bureaucracy, which had been for a time
a useful protective device for making rational solutions more
acceptable, has now lost its role. Contradictions at the
governing level therefore tend to grow while governments are
forced to be much more nation-centered and much less
reliable.

Each country, of course, is substantially different. The
main characteristic of Western Europe is its diversity. But
across the widely different practices and rationalizations, two
basic characteristics hold true about the basic problem of
governability:

* The European political systems are overloaded with
  participants and demands, and they have increasing difficulty
  in mastering the very complexity which is the natural result
  of their economic growth and political development.
* The bureaucratic cohesiveness they have to sustain in
  order to maintain their capacity to decide and implement
  tends to foster irresponsibility and the breakdown of
  consensus, which increase in turn the difficulty of their task.

### The Overload of the Decision-Making Systems
The superiority of democracies has often been ascribed to
their basic openness. Open systems, however, give better
returns only under certain conditions. They are threatened
by entropy if they cannot maintain or develop proper
regulations. European democracies have been only partially
and sometimes theoretically open. Their regulations were
built on a subtle screening of participants and demands; and
if we can talk of overload, notwithstanding the progress made
in handling complexity, it is because this traditional model of
screening and government by distance has gradually broken
down to the point that the necessary regulations have all but
disappeared.

There are a number of interrelated reasons for this
situation. First of all, social and economic developments have
made it possible for a great many more groups and interests
to coalesce. Second, the information explosion has made it
difficult if not impossible to maintain the traditional distance
that was deemed necessary to govern. Third, the democratic
ethos makes it difficult to prevent access and restrict
information, while the persistence of the bureaucratic
processes which had been associated with the traditional
governing systems makes it impossible to handle them at a
low enough level. Because of the instant information model
and because of this lack of self-regulating subsystems, any
kind of minor conflict becomes a governmental problem.

These convergences and contradictions have given rise to a
growing paradox. While it has been traditionally believed that
the power of the state depended on the number of decisions
it could take, the more decisions the modern state has to
handle, the more helpless it becomes. Decisions do not only
bring power; they also bring vulnerability. The modern
European state's basic weakness is its liability to blackmailing
tactics.

Another series of factors tending to overload all industrial
or post-industrial social systems develops from the natural
complexity which is the result of organizational growth,
systemic interdependence, and the shrinking of a world
where fewer and fewer consequences can be treated as
acceptable externalities. European societies not only do not
escape this general trend, they also do not face it with the
necessary increase of governing capacities. Politicians and
administrators have found it easier and more expedient to
give up to complexity. They tend to accommodate to it and
even to use it as a useful smoke screen. One can give access to
more groups and more demands without having to say no and
one can maintain and expand one's own freedom of action
or, in more unpleasant terms, one's own irresponsibility.[^2/1]

Beyond a certain degree of complexity, however, nobody
can control the outcomes of one system; government
credibility declines; decisions come from nowhere; citizens'
alienation develops and irresponsible blackmail increases,
thus feeding back into the circle: One might argue that the
Lindblom model of partisan mutual adjustment would give a
natural order to this chaotic bargaining, but this does not
seem to be the case because the fields are at the same time
poorly structured and not regulated.[^2/2]

One might also wonder why European nations should
suffer more complexity and more overload than the United
States, which obviously has a more complex system open to
more participants. But overload and complexity are only
relative to the capacity to handle them, and the present
weakness of the European nations comes from the fact that
their capacity is much lower because their tradition has not
enabled them to build decision-making systems based on
these premises. This judgment about the European
nation-states' decision-making capabilities may be surprising
since European countries, like Britain and France, pride
themselves in having the best possible elite corps of
professional decision-makers, in many ways better trained or
at least better selected than their American counterparts. The
seeming paradox can be understood if one accepts the idea
that decision-making is not done only by top civil servants
and politicians but is the product of bureaucratic processes
taking place in complex organizations and systems. If these
processes are routine-oriented and cumbersome, and these
organizations and systems overly rigid, communications will
be difficult, no regulation will prevent blackmail, and poor
structure will increase the overload. For all their
sophistication, modern decision-making techniques do not
seem to have helped very much yet because the problem is
political or systemic and not a technical one.

One of the best examples of their failure has been shown
in a recent comparative study of the way two similar
decisions were made in Paris in the 1890s and in the 1960s:
the decision to build the first Parisian subway and the
decision to build the new regional express transit system.
This comparison shows a dramatic decline in the capacity to
take rational decisions between the two periods. The 1890s
decision gave rise to a very difficult but lively political debate
and was a slow decision-making sequence, but it was arrived
at on sound premises financially, economically, and socially.
The 1960s decision was made in semisecret, without open
political debate, but with a tremendous amount of lobbying
and intrabureaucratic conflict. Its results, when one analyzes
the outcomes, were strikingly poorer in terms of social,
economic, and financial returns. It seems that the elite
professional decision-makers backed up with sophisticated
tools could not do as well as their less brilliant predecessors,
while the technical complexity of the decision was certainly
not greater. The only striking difference is the tremendous
increase in the level of complexity of the system and its
dramatic overload due to its confusing centralization.[^2/3]

It is true that there are many differences among the
European countries in this respect and one should not talk
too hastily of common European conditions. There is quite a
strong contrast, for example, between a country like Sweden,
which has developed an impressive capability for handling
complex problems by relieving ministerial staffs of the
burden of administrative and technical decisions and by
allocating considerable decision-making powers to
strengthened local authorities, and a country like Italy, where
a very weak bureaucracy and an unstable political system
cannot take decisions and cannot facilitate the achievement
of any kind of adjustment. Nevertheless, the majority of
European countries are somewhat closer to the Italian model
and Sweden seems to be, for the moment, a striking
exception. This exception does not seem to be due to the size
or type of problems since small countries, like Belgium or
even the Netherlands and Denmark, are also victims of
overload and complexity due to the rigidity and complexity
of group allegiances and to the fragmentation of the polity.

### Bureaucratic Weight and Civic Irresponsibility

The governability of West European nations is hampered
by another set of related problems which revolve around the
general emphasis on bureaucratic rule, the lack of civic
responsibility, and the breakdown of consensus.

A basic problem is developing everywhere: the opposition
between the decision-making game and the implementation
game. Completely different rationales are at work at one level
and at the other. In the decision-making game, the capacity
to master a successful coalition for a final and finite
agreement is a function of the nature and rules of the game in
which the decision is one outcome. Since the same participants
are playing the same game for quite a number of crucial
decisions, the nature of their game, the participants' resources,
and the power relationships between them may have
as much validity in predicting outcomes as the substance of
the problem and its possible rational solution. In the
implementation game, however, completely different actors
appear whose frames of reference have nothing to do with
national decision-making bargaining and whose game is
heavily influenced by the power structure and modes of
relationship in the bureacracy on one hand, and in
the politico-administrative system in which the decision is to
be implemented on the other. It is quite frequent that the
two games work differently and may even be completely at
odds. A gap can therefore exist between the rationality of the
decision-makers and the outcomes of their activity, which
means that collective regulation of human activities in a
complex system is basically frustrating. Such a situation is
reproduced and exemplified at the upper political level where
all modern democratic systems suffer from a general
separation between an electoral coalition and the process of
government. A completely different set of alliances is
necessary to get an electoral majority and to face the
problems of government. The United States and Japan also
have these problems, but they are especially acute in West
European countries because of the fragmentation of social
systems, the great difficulties of communication, and the
barriers between different subsystems which tend to close up
and operate in isolation.

Two different models, however, are predominant in
Western Europe. One model, which has worse consequences
for governability, is the bureaucratic model associated with a
lack of consensus. This is the model exemplified especially by
countries like France and Italy, where a very sizable part of
the electorate will always vote for extremist parties, of the
left and to some extent of the right, that do not accept the
minimum requirements of the democratic system. In these
countries social control is imposed on the citizens by a state
apparatus which is very much isolated from the population.
Politico-administrative regulations work according to a basic
vicious circle: bureaucratic rule divorced from the political
rhetoric and from the needs of the citizens fosters among them
alienation and irresponsibility which form the necessary context
for the breakdown of consensus that has developed. Lack
of consensus in its turn makes it indispensable to resort to
bureaucratic rule, since one cannot take the risk of involving
citizens who do not accept the minimum rules of the game.
Generally, when social control has been traditionally achieved
by strong bureaucratic pressure, democratic consensus has not
developed fully and consensual breakdowns are endemic
possibilities. All European countries retain some of these
traditional control mechanisms.

However, an alternative model is exemplified by the
countries of northwestern Europe where a broad consensus
has been achieved early enough and constantly reinforced,
thus preventing the state bureaucracy from dominating too
exclusively. Sweden, with its strong local decision-making
system, with its consensual labor-management bargaining
system, and with its ombudsman grievance procedures against
the bureaucracy, is the best example of such a model.

Nevertheless, a general drift toward alienation, irresponsibility,
and breakdown of consensus also exists in
these countries and even in Sweden. In time, group
bargaining has become more and more routinized, that is,
more and more bureaucratic, and workers, if not citizens
generally, have also tended to feel as alienated as those in
revolutionary Europe. In Denmark, the Netherlands, and
Britain, the social democratic consensus is breaking down
while the relationships between groups have become so
complex and erratic that citizens are more and more
frustrated. Politics become divorced from the citizens'
feelings and even from reality. Vicious circles therefore tend
to develop which bring these countries much closer than they
ever were to the countries of continental Europe. Even
Sweden has been affected, at least in its labor relations.[^2/4]

### The European Dimension

All these problems are certainly multiplied by the new
dimension of international problems which has made the
European national state a somewhat obsolete entity. One
could obviously conceive of a federal European system which
could rely on strong decentralized local and regional
decision-making systems, thus reducing the overload on the
top, the bureaucratic nature of the intermediary processes,
and the citizens' alienation. But efforts at unification have
tended to reinforce the national bureaucratic apparatuses
as if these traditional nervous centers of European affairs
could not help but harden again. Thus, Western Europe faces
one of its most impossible dilemmas. Its problems are more
and more European in nature, but its capacity to face them
relies on institutional instruments of a national and
bureaucratic nature that are more and more inadequate but
that tend at the same time to harden their hold on the
system.

Personalization of power in Western Europe also has been
used in national and international affairs to fight the
bureaucratic entanglements and to foster citizens'
identification when participation could not work. Its results,
however, are always disappointing. Leaders become prisoners
of their image and are too vulnerable to act. They become
public relations figures, thus creating a credibility gap and
broadening the misunderstanding between citizens and their
decision-making system.

One should not, however, overemphasize the general drift
toward irresponsibility and impotence in individual European
states and in Europe as a whole. Problems are threatening,
the capacity to handle them seems to have diminished, but
there are still many areas where government performances are
satisfactory compared with those of past governments, those
of other Trilateral areas, and those of the rest of the world.
European societies are still very civilized societies whose
citizens are well-protected and whose amenities and possibilities
of enjoyment have not only been maintained but
extended to a great many more people. In addition Europe
suffers less from social disruption and crime than the United
States.

There are growing areas, nevertheless, where governments'
capacity to act and to meet the challenge of citizens'
demands has been drastically impaired. Almost everywhere
secondary education and the universities are affected as well
as, frequently, metropolitan government, land use, and urban
renewal. This impairment of capacities is becoming prevalent
in more countries in bargaining among groups, income
redistribution, and the handling of inflation.

## SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND CULTURAL CAUSES

In order to better understand these general features of the
socio-political systems of Western Europe, and to be able to
suggest general orientations for the discussion of possible
change, we should first try to concentrate on the social,
economic, and cultural causes of the present crises. Causes
and consequences, however, are basically interrelated, and it
is impossible to disentangle them. Therefore, we will try to
focus successively on some of the major problem areas which
can be used for a better understanding of the present
situation.

First of all, we will try to assess the general socio-economic
context, which can be characterized sociologically by the
explosion of social interaction and economically by the
disruptive effect of continuous growth. We will then try to
analyze the general collapse of traditional institutions, which
may be the immediate background of the crisis. We will then
move on to the problem of cultural institutions, focusing
especially on the intellectuals, education, and the media. We
will conclude by reviewing a last circumstantial problem
which has had an accelerating impact --- the problem of
inflation.

### The Increase of Social Interaction

In every developed country man has become much more a
social animal than before. There has been an explosion of
human interaction and correlatively a tremendous increase of
social pressure. The social texture of human life has become
and is becoming more and more complex and its management
more difficult. Dispersion, fragmentation, and simple ranking
have been replaced by concentration, interdependence, and a
complex texture. Organized systems have become tremendously
more complex, and they tend to prevail, in a much
more composite and complex social system, over the more
simple forms of yesterday. Because of the basic importance
of the contemporary complex social texture, its management
has a crucial importance, which raises the problem of social
control over the individual.

Europe is in a very special situation because it has a long
record of traditional social control imposed upon the
individual by collective authorities, especially the state, and
by hierarchical religious institutions. Certainly these
authorities and institutions had been liberalized over the
centuries since the time of absolutism. Nevertheless, a strong
association between social control and hierarchical values still
persists, which means that a basic contradiction tends to
reappear. Citizens make incompatible claims. Because they
press for more action to meet the problems they have to face,
they require more social control. At the same time they resist
.any kind of social control that is associated with the hierarchical
values they have learned to discard and reject. The
problem may be worldwide, but it is exacerbated in Europe,
where social discipline is not worshipped as it still is in Japan,
and where more indirect forms of social control have not
developed as in North America.

European countries, therefore, have more difficult
problems to overcome to go beyond a certain level of
complexity in their politico-administrative, social, and even
economic systems. There are differences in each country,
each one having maintained a very distinctive collective
system of social control. But each one of these systems now
appears to be insufficient to solve the problems of the time.
This is as true for Britain, which was considered to have
mastered forever the art of government, as it is for Italy,
which could have been an example of stable "nongovernment."
France, also, has a centralized apparatus less and less
adequate to manage modern complex systems and becomes
therefore more vulnerable. To some extent Germany benefits
from the deep trauma of nazism, which has forced more basic
change in the management of its social texture, but it is
nevertheless under the same kind of strains.

### The Impact of Economic Growth

The impact of economic growth can be better understood
in view of these basic strains. It was believed in the fifties and
early sixties that the achievement of economic growth was
the great problem for European nations. If only their GNP
could grow for long enough, most of their troubles as divided
and nonconsensual polities would gradually disappear. This
fact was so overwhelmingly accepted that for a long time the
official line of the communist parties was to deny the reality
of the material progress of the working class and to argue
that capitalist development had brought not only a relative
but also an absolute decline of workers' income. However,
certain facts had to be finally faced: namely, the tremendous
economic gains made during the past twenty years by all
groups and especially the workers. But the consequences of
this were to be the opposite of what had been expected.
Instead of appeasing tensions, material progress seems to have
exacerbated them.

Three main factors seem necessary to account for the
paradox. First, as it happens everywhere, change produces
rising expectations which cannot be met by its necessarily
limited outcomes. Once people know that things can change,
they cannot accept easily anymore the basic features of their
condition that were once taken for granted. Europe has been
especially vulnerable since its unprecedented economic boom
had succeeded a long period of stagnation with pent-up
feelings of frustration. Moreover, its citizens have been more
sophisticated politically and especially vulnerable to invidious
comparisons from category to category.

A second factor has to be taken into consideration: the
special role played by radical ideology in European
working-class politics. At a simple level, the European
revolutionary and nonconsensual ideologies of working-class
parties and trade unions were associated with the economic
and cultural lag that did not allow the working people a fair
share in society's benefits. But ideology is only partially a
consequence of frustration; it is also a weapon for action.
And in the European context, it remains the most effective
available instrument for mobilization. When ideology
declines, the capacity of the unions to achieve results also
declines. The processes of orderly collective bargaining,
even when they bring results, tend to be also so complex and
bureaucratic that they produce disaffection. Rank-and-file
workers do not recognize themselves in such a bureaucratic
process and they tend to drift away, which means that the
more trade unions and working-class parties accept regular
procedures, the weaker they become in their capacity to
mobilize their followers and to put real pressure on the
system. Thus, they have to rediscover radicalism. This is
much more true for the Latin countries, which had never
achieved a satisfactory bargaining system, but radical drift
has also been very strong in northwest Europe. Generally,
even if workers have become better integrated in the overall
social system, they nevertheless remain basically frustrated
with the forms of bargaining which do not allow them much
participation. Therefore, a radical ideology is necessary to
enable them to commit themselves to the social game. This
situation is especially strong in many countries where it can
be argued that working-class groups have not benefited from
prosperity as greatly as they should or could have. Conversely,
those countries where blue-collar-workers' progress has
been comparatively the greatest and the steadiest, such as
Germany, are also those whose resistance to inflation and to
the ideological drift is the strongest.

A third factor may be more fundamental. This is the most
disruptive consequence of accelerated change. It is true
enough that change often brings greater material results and
that people have been able to recognize and appreciate their
gains, although they might have denied them for a long time.
But accelerated change is extremely costly in terms of
disruption. It means that many branches and enterprises
decline and even disappear while others undergo tremendous
growth. People are forced to be mobile geographically and
occupationally, which can be accounted for in terms of
psychological costs. They have had to face a new form of
uncertainty and are likely to compare their fates more often
to the fates of other groups. Tensions, therefore, are bound
to increase.

Moreover, these processes have had a direct and profound
impact on the modes of social control operating in society.
And this is where Europe has been much more vulnerable
than either the United States or Japan. In a society where
social control had traditionally relied on fragmentation,
stratification, and social barriers to communication, the
disruptive effect of change which tends to destroy these
barriers, while forcing people to communicate, makes it more
and more difficult to govern. The problem has never been so
acute in North America, which has always been on the whole
a much more open society; and it is still not yet as developed
in Japan, which has been able up to now to maintain its
forms of social control while undergoing even more economic
change.

Wide differences of course persist between the very diverse
European nations. Italy and to some extent France have been
less directly perturbed because they have remained more
hierarchical in their social texture.[^2/5] Throughout the world
individuals have lost a great deal of their traditional frames of
reference and have not found substitutes in their
relationships with the collective group. Everywhere anomie
has increased for young people; groups are more volatile and
social control is much weaker. At the same time, the direct
effect of economic and geographical disruptions requires
proper handling; it requires the imposition of collective
disciplines which these disruptions make it impossible to
generate.[^2/6]

A no-growth economy is, of course, no solution, as Britain
has clearly shown. No country can isolate itself from general
change. British society may have suffered less disruption than
the continental countries, but it is now, in counterpart, the
victim of its poor economic performance. British people may
still be individually less tense than people on the continent,
but they are becoming collectively demoralized. Egalitarianism
and mass participation pressures have increased as they
did elsewhere and the gap between promises and expectations
has widened even more, leading to repeated and frustrating
clashes between the bureaucracy and various sectors of the
general public, to poorer and poorer government performances,
and to widespread feelings of political alienation.

### The Collapse of Traditional Institutions

The contradiction regarding social control has been
amplified by the near collapse of the traditional authority
structure which was buttressing social control processes. The
collapse is partly due to the disruptive effect of change, but it
can also be viewed as the logical outcome of a general
evolution of the relationship of the individual to society.

Everywhere in the West the freedom of choice of the
individual has increased tremendously. With the crumbling of
old barriers everything seems to be possible. Not only can
people choose their jobs, their friends, and their mates
without being constrained by earlier conventions, but they
can drop these relationships more easily. People whose range
of opportunities is greater and whose freedom of change also
is greater can be much more demanding and cannot accept
being bound by lifelong relationships. This is, of course,
much more true for young people. It has further been
compounded by the development of sexual freedom and by
the questioning of woman's place in society. In such a
context traditional authority had to be put into question.
Not only did it run counter to the tremendous new wave of
individual assertion, but at the same time it was losing the
capacity which it had maintained for an overly long time to
control people who had no alternatives.

The late sixties have been a major turning point. The
amount of underlying change was dramatically revealed in
the political turmoil of the period which forced a sort of
moral showdown over a certain form of traditional authority.
Its importance has been mistaken inasmuch as the revolt
seemed to be aiming at political goals. What was at stake
appears now to be moral much more than political
authority --- churches, schools, and cultural organizations more
than political and even economic institutions.

In the short space of a few years, churches seem to have
been the most deeply upset. In most of Europe, a basic shift
was accelerated which deprived them of their political and
even moral authority over their flocks and within society at
large. The Catholic church has been hit the hardest because it
had remained more authoritarian. Yet as opinion polls have
shown, religious feelings and religious needs persist. They
may even have been reactivated by the anxieties of our time
so that eventually churches will be able to regain some of the
ground they have lost. In order to succeed they will have to
open up and abandon what remains of their traditional
principles.

This may have been already achieved since the authoritarian
pattern is vanishing. The crisis is much more apparent within
the hierarchy than among the laity. Priests are leaving the
churches at an increasing rate; they cannot be replaced, and
those who stay do not accept the bureaucratic authority of
their superiors and the constraints of the dogma as
obediently as before. They are in a position to exact a much
better deal, and they get it. Conversely, they feel less capable
of exerting the traditional moral authority they maintained
over laymen. It may be exaggerated to pretend that the
age-old system of moral obligations and guidance that
constituted the church has crumbled; it is still alive, but it has
changed more in the last decade than during the last two
centuries. Around this change the new effervescence that has
developed may be analyzed as a proof of vitality. New
rationales may emerge around which the system will stabilize.
But it seems clear enough already that the traditional model,
which had been for so long one of the main ideological
strongholds of European societal structures, has disintegrated.
This is certainly a major change for European societies. Such
a model provided a basic pattern for the social order and was
used as a last recourse for buttressing social control, even in
the so-called laicist countries like France where the Catholic
church was supposed to have only a minor influence. The
impact of the basic shift of values will be widespread. Even
the nonreligious milieus, which had maintained similar
models of social control despite their opposition to the
Catholic principles, will not be able to resist change any
better even if at first glance they seem less directly affected.

Education as a moral establishment is faced with the same
problem and may be the first example of this corresponding
similarity between opposing traditions. Whatever philosophical
influences were exerted over it in particular countries,
education is in trouble all over Western Europe. It has lost its
former authority. Teachers cannot believe anymore in their
"sacred" mission and their students do not accept their
authority as easily as they did before. Along with the
religious rationale for the social order, educational authority
does not hold firm anymore. Knowledge is widely shared.
Teachers have lost their prestige within society, and the
closed hierarchical relations that made them powerful figures
in the classroom have disappeared. Routine makes it possible
for the system to work and the sheer necessity and weight of
its functions will maintain it in operation. But the malaise is
deep. The dogmatic structure disintegrates; no one knows
how to operate without a structure and new forms do not
seem to be emerging. We are still in the process of
destructuration where generous utopias still seem to be the
only constructive answers to the malaise.

Higher education, which has had a more spectacular
revolution, may have been partly revived, but in many
countries and in many disciplines it is still in chaos. European
universities do not offer any kind of institutional leadership.
They are not real institutions for their students.
Very few teachers will be able to propose positive and
nonideological models of commitment to values which can be
acceptable to students. Consequently, the universities'
potential cannot be used as a stimulant for change in society
and young people's energies are easily diverted toward
meaningless and negative struggles.

Other institutions are also, if less severely, perturbed by
this collapse of moral authority. Among them the army, at
least in its roles as training school for organizational
disciplines and symbol and embodiment of patriotic values,
has lost its moral and psychological appeal. Defense may be
more and more entrusted to professional armies that may
remain reliable. But the conscript army as a school for the
citizen and as a model of authority is on the wane. It has lost
all sense of purpose. It is really isolated from the mainstream
of human relationships. Thus, another stronghold of the
moral fabric of Western societies disappears.

Curiously enough the problem of authority in economic
organizations, which had always been considered the most
difficult battlefield of industrial society, seems comparatively
less explosive. Difficulties have been reactivated during the
upheaval of the late sixties. Economic sanctions and the
visibility of results, however, give participants some acceptable
rationale for collective endeavor. Nevertheless, European
enterprises are weaker as institutions, on the whole, than
their American or Japanese counterparts. They lack consensus
over the system of authority as well as over the system
of resources allocation, and they even often lack enough
agreement regarding the rules of the game in conflict situations.

The problems are more difficult when the social system
has maintained some of the rigid features of a former class
society and when authority is supposed to be imposed from
above. The situation is considerably more touchy in Italy and
to some extent also in France than in Scandinavia and
Germany, where discipline has long been internalized.[^2/7]
Nevertheless, the problem remains more acute in Europe than
in the United States, where people have gradually learned
newer forms of social control, or in Japan, where older forms
of social control persist and readjust to present requirements
in a very active fashion.

Two important series of consequences are derived from
this institutional weakness. First, the integration of the
working class into the social game is only partial, especially in
the Latin countries and in France. Second, the weight of the
organizational middle classes of middle executives and
supervisors constitutes a conservative, eventually paralyzing
force.

The lack of integration of the working class not only
prevents direct bargaining and understanding, which makes
the European enterprise more vulnerable, but it is at the root
of the widespread reluctance of young people to accept the
humiliating, underpaid lower-blue-collar jobs. European
entrepreneurs have found an easy solution to the workforce
problem by turning to migrant workers from Southern
Europe and North Africa. However, this policy, which had
been highly successful for a while and which has fed the
industrial development of Western Europe during its boom
years, has brought new and difficult problems in the
community life of West European cities. Gradually another
factor of instability has developed since foreign workers have
begun to question their place and range of opportunities in
the social and economic system.

Efforts at promoting working-class jobs and upgrading and
integrating blue-collar jobs into the mainstream of industrial
development have usually failed because of the weight of the
hierarchy. And the middle-most hierarchical categories have
slowed down the modernization of the institutional fabric of
economic organizations. Their attitudes, furthermore, help
maintain in these European organizations the rigidity of
social control that prevents modernization and growth.

Indeed, if European enterprises look more healthy than
European churches and schools, this is also because they still
rely more on the old model of social control. One may
surmise that economic organizations will have to follow suit
after the others, which probably means disruption.
Differences between countries remain considerable. Sweden,
for instance, is well ahead in the development of a new model
while Italy is in a stage of partial disruption.

### The Upsetting of the Intellectual World

Another basic source of disruption of Western societies
comes from the intellectual world. Daniel Bell has rightly
pointed out the basic importance of culture in the coming of
post-industrial society. Knowledge tends to become the basic
resource of humanity. Intellectuals as a social group are
pushed into the forefront of sociopolitical struggles and the
relationships of the intellectual world to society change
radically. But neither Daniel Bell nor any other futurologist
has foreseen the importance and the painfulness of such an
ongoing process of change. There is no reason to believe that
the contemporary cultural revolution will be more peaceful
than the industrial revolutions of the past.

We seem to be, as a matter of fact, in a cultural crisis
which may be the greatest challenge that confronts Western
societies, inasmuch as our incapacity to develop appropriate
decision-making mechanisms --- the ungovernability of our
societies --- is a cultural failure. Europe, in this respect, is the
most troubled and the most vulnerable of the three Trilateral
areas, primarily because the strength and centrality of its
intellectual tradition makes it more difficult to develop new
models.

The first element of the crisis is the problem of numbers.
The coming of a post-industrial society means a tremendous
increase in the numbers of intellectuals, would be
intellectuals, and para-intellectuals. Not only do older
intellectual professions develop, but newer ones appear, and
many nonintellectual jobs become professional. But the more
intellectuals there are, the less prestige there is for each. Here
again we come to the real paradox: The more central a
profession becomes, the less prestige and influence its average
member will have as an individual. There would not be any
problem if the socialization and training process would be
geared to the new state of affairs. But people continue to be
trained in the traditional aristocratic ethos of the prestigious
roles of yesterday. They are thus prepared to expect a
completely different pattern of activities and relationships
with the outside world than is actually the case. Moreover,
the cumulative effects of their individual endeavors to
promote and modernize their roles tend to diminish and
routinize them.

A new stratification thus develops between those persons
who can really play a leading role and those who have to
accept a humbler status. But this stratification is in turn a
factor in the malaise because in many countries, particularly
France and Britain, the happy few acquire and maintain their
positions by restrictive monopolistic practices.

Another factor of discontent comes from the importance
of the aristocratic tradition in Western Europe's cultural
world. According to that tradition, intellectuals are romantic
figures who naturally get a position of prominence through a
sort of aristocratic exaltation. This attitude is still very much
alive and dominant at a subconscious level. Yet intellectuals
as agents of change and moral guides in a period of fast
changes should be and are effectively in the vanguard of the
fight against the old aristocratic tradition. Thus not only are
they working destroy the privileges that they
unconsciously crave, but many of them undergo a moral
crisis for which a radical stand is often an easy solution.

The internal upsetting of the traditional intellectual roles,
whose new occupants discover that they do not meet the
expectations which had prompted their own personal
commitments, is increased, if not multiplied, because of the
existence of very strong displacement within the
intellectual world itself. While a long tradition had given the
humanities an honored position, the new trend favors the
new intellectual professions that may be of more practical
use. The more post-industrial society becomes intellectualized,
the more it tends to displace traditional value-oriented
intellectual disciplines to the benefit of action-oriented ones,
that is, those disciplines that can play a direct role in
policy-making.

Value-oriented intellectuals do not disappear or even
decline, howevēr. They find new and rapidly-developing
openings in the fields of communications. But such a
reorientation may be morally painful since it can be viewed
as somewhat debasing. In any case, the opposition of the two
cultures, described by C.P. Snow, has shifted greatly. It has
become a battle between those persons who play the
audience, even if it is a protest type, and those who
contribute to the process of decision-making. Thus, the basic
crisis of the intellectual world is a crisis of identity in a
rapidly changing world where the basic mechanisms of
regulation have been put severely into question.

Many other factors, of course, are at work. The cultural
world may be considered as a sounding board for the other
forms of malaise of Western societies. But one should
emphasize that this sounding board plays a very important,
autonomous role of its own, first of all because it reinforces
the uncertainties and driving anxieties it is expressing and,
second, because it projects on the whole of society the crises
of identity its members are experiencing.

Notwithstanding the many differences between countries,
one can clearly recognize a general drift in the art and literary
worlds toward a protest and even revolutionary posture. It
has clearly shaped the cultural context in which the younger
generations move.

The importance of such trend should not be
underestimated. True enough, one can correctly dismiss its
immediate political influence and recognize the superficiality
of its fashionable aspects. But it has a meaning and an
influence at a deeper level. It is an expression of a basic
weakening of Western Europe's sense of purpose, capacity to
lead, and to govern itself. Above all, it is the source of a
profound divorce between the ruling people and the young
talents.

Even if it does not affect the general public, which tends
to react against highbrow pessimism, the overall mood of
Western societies is shaped by a general cultural tendency.
West European values are not rejuvenated in a convincing
way. No model of civilization emerges from the present-day
drifting culture, no call for reform and pioneering. Ritualism
and self-pity remain the basic undercurrent behind the
arrogant radical criticism that prevails on the surface. Vague
utopias certainly do not counterbalance the stronger
apocalyptic nihilism that forms the texture of our vanguard
culture. On the other hand, there is no possible dialogue
between the ruling elite and the new generation. Fragmentation
and stratification, which were stifling traditional class
society, seem to perpetuate themselves through new cultural
cleavages. Other regulatory mechanisms which we cannot
distinguish yet may be at work. A new blossoming may well
follow this long hibernating process. But we must face the
fact that we are now in the most vulnerable part of the cycle
of change or, to put it a better way, of the process of
transition to post-industrial society.

### The Mass Media

The vulnerability of the cultural world and its importance
for the whole of society is compounded because of the
central role it plays in two basic subsystems of modern
societies: education and the media.

Education exemplifies some of the same basic
contradictions as the world of culture. The prestige of
teachers has decreased with the tremendous increase of their
numbers while their expectations are still greatly influenced
by the traditional liberal flavor of their calling. And they are,
even more than other intellectuals, directly confronted with
the revolution in human relations that perturbs their
traditional mode of social control. At the same time, with its
cultural drift society has lost the stimulating moral guidance
it requires. As a consequence the transmission of social,
political, and cultural norms has been very deeply perturbed,
thus feeding back into society as a whole. Already research
results show the extent of intellectual breakdown and
disorientation that prevails in many sectors of the
population. People's behavior is not touched, really, but they
can no longer rely on a coherent rationalization of its
context, and they feel at a loss to find out how they relate to
society. Anomic rebellion, estrangement from society, and
alienation certainly have dangerously progressed because of
this cultural void.

The media are not in as great a crisis as education is.
However, they have been transformed by the explosion and
expansion of communications and the new role played by
value-intellectuals. The media's influence on politics and
governability is much more direct than that of education, and
the media play a most decisive role in the present drift of
Western societies. They are a very important source of
disintegration of the old forms of social control inasmuch as
they contribute to the breakdown of old barriers to
communication. Television, particularly, has played a major
role in this respect. It has made it impossible to maintain the
cultural fragmentation and hierarchy that was necessary to
enforce traditional forms of social control. Its impact has
been more recent and more difficult than in the United
States or Japan because of the much stronger resistance of
fragmented and stratified European societies. Its use is still
more differentiated according to social categories or classes.
Nevertheless, the strength of the appeal of television is such
that it has forced a complete change of public and social life,
and has also indirectly helped the press to restructure itself.
The main impact of these changes, of course, is visibility. The
only real event is the event that is reported and seen. Thus,
journalists possess a crucial role as gatekeepers of one of the
central dimensions of public life.

The media have thus become an autonomous power. It is
not new to talk about the Fourth Estate. But we now are
witnessing a crucial change when the profession tends to
regulate itself in such a way as to resist pressure from
financial or governmental interests. Television, which is
heavily influenced in many countries by governmental
control, works much less openly than newspapers;
self-regulation, however, is everywhere on the increase. This
could be viewed as tremendous progress. But at the same
time these mechanisms of self-regulation of the media tend to
be strongly biased. If journalists can create events, they have
a structuring impact on public and social life. And if their
basic logic in creating events is to reach the widest possible
audience, they will tend to bias the social game in such a way
that public figures will have to play for this audience much
more than for real outcomes. This has many consequences:

First, the media become a tremendous sounding board for
the difficulties and tensions of society. Movements and
fashions take broader proportions. It is much more difficult
to escape the whirlpool of public relations events and to
concentrate on more basic problems.

Second, the media
deprive governments and to some extent also other
responsible authorities of the time lag, tolerance, and trust
that make it possible to innovate and to experiment
responsibly.

Third, the pressure of the media makes it extremely
difficult to solve a basic dilemma of modern complex
systems, which has been brought to light as the
counterintuitive effect.[^2/8] Systems operate in such a way that
very often the general outcome of individual action runs
counter to the will of the actors and to the general intuition
one may have in advance. Thus it is imperative to give much
more importance to systems analyses than to the immediate
and apparent views of the actors, which is evidently the bias
of the media. The more this sounding board emphasizes the
emotional appeal of the actors' "life experience," especially
as biased by the techniques of the media, the less easy it is to
force a real analysis of the complex game on which political
leaders must act. Finally, the emphasis on direct evidence
appears to be as loaded with ideology and manipulation as
old style oratory. Journalists' autonomy does not lead
necessarily to transparency and truth but may distort the
perception of reality.

Here we find the problem of journalists as value-oriented
intellectuals who tend to be governed by the game of
catching the audience's attention and are responsible
therefore for the acceleration of the cultural drift. In the long
run, this problem may be much more important than the
problems of financial and government interference in the
media, which are everywhere tending to recede.

In politics, however, the public relations effect is quite
different from the North American one since the ruling elite
and the educated audience play a major role as an important
screen. They constitute the primary audience of the
highbrow publications, which in turn tend to structure the
problems that will finally reach the broader audience. Public
relations of a public figure will be conditioned by the
existence of these two levels. This means that there is a very
serious buffer against too immediate reactions. But this does
not mean a suppression of the public relations distortion,
only a transformation of its conditions. At any rate the
pressure for change that is against secrecy and protection of
leaders seems to be more on the increase. The only ready
answer to counterbalance it is the use of bureaucracy for real
action, which means that the gap between the decisionmaking
system, distorted by public relations problems, and
the implementation system, protected but also bound and
biased by bureaucratic machine-regulating mechanisms, will
tend to increase, thus triggering constant new waves of
frustration and anger and diminishing the amount of trust
people will give to their leadership.

### Inflation

Inflation can be considered a direct result of the
ungovernability of Western democracies. It is an easy answer
to the tensions of growth. The less a society is capable of
facing them, the readier it is to accept inflation as a less
painful solution. At the same time it is an independent source
of disruption which exacerbates conflicts and still diminishes
the capacity of groups and societies to act. Present-day
inflation, therefore, ought to be considered, even if very
briefly, as another independent variable to be analyzed as a
supplementary cause of disruption.

It is no wonder that the countries whose social fabric is the
weakest, those whose model of social control is still based on
hierarchy, fragmentation, and distance, have always been
much more vulnerable to inflation. In the 1960s, however, a
reasonable sort of equilibrium had been found according to
which the anticipation of growth was reasonably matched
with actual growth while Keynesian policies were stabilizing
the system. The golden age of economics, however, was
shorter in Europe, Germany excepted, than in North
America. In any case, no country can now resist the
tremendous pressure of the new turbulence in the world.

Present-day large-scale inflation has been for a time
remarkably well accepted. It has had a strong distorting
effect on the economic and social position of individuals and
groups. But its impersonal operation prevents direct
complaint. Furthermore, the groups which usually speak the
loudest are those which are likely to benefit from the process.
One can even claim that the combination of public feeling,
trade union pressure, and governmental intervention has
tended to operate in favor of low salaries. Thus, professional
salaried middle classes, which were certainly privileged, have
lost some of their advantages. It is not as unfair an outcome
as one would immediately tend to believe.

The problems of inflation, however, change their nature
when the so-called double-digit numbers seem to become a
stable feature of the economic picture. The costs seem then
more and more unbearable. Not only do distortions appear,
but social relationships become unstable. Lack of trust
prevents the necessary regulation of large and small economic
and social subsystems. More people, moreover, anticipate a
crisis, and the governments' margin of freedom is reduced to
the lowest level. We can observe this in Britain and in Italy.
Between unemployment and inflation there does not seem
any middle way. Basically, governments appear to be unable
to induce groups which are in strategic positions to accept
sacrifices. European unity is not much of a real help since it
is much easier for any government to dump on the outside
world the consequences of its own weaknesses. European
countries' foreign economic policies tend to be, on the
whole, not only uncoordinated but even erratic.

There are, however, some positive elements in the picture:
Germany's understanding that it cannot retain its prosperity
alone; France's surprisingly better economic results; and
Franco-German cooperation. While these factors may not yet
be inspiring for the presently weaker countries, they may be
a new point of departure and, if some success develops, they
will play a very important symbolic role for the development
of the new capacities Europe requires.

Inflation and its twin evil depression finally make the
problem of governability an immediate and practical
one. And the basic question is: Are the European countries
ready to meet the challenge of the new situation, to develop
in time of crisis the institutional capacity they could not
develop in time of prosperity? To make an educated guess on
this very crucial problem, one must now focus more closely
on the role and structure of political values in present-day
Western Europe.

## THE ROLE AND STRUCTURE OF POLITICAL VALUES

### The Values Structure and the Problem of Rationality

Behind all these governability problems of modern Western
societies lie some more basic problems of values.
Participation, people's consent, equality, the right of the
collectivity to intervene in personal affairs, and the possible
acceptance of authority seem to be the preliminary questions
to debate before giving a reasonable diagnosis and proposing
possible solutions.

The relationship of values to behavior and especially to
institutionalized behavior is much more complex than is
usually believed, which makes the interpretation of opinion
polls highly questionable. Above all, there is a wide
discrepancy between professed values --- what we can get
through opinion polls and even attitude surveys --- and actual
behavior-what people will eventually do when problems
force them to choose. Not only is there a discrepancy but the
nature, importance, and even direction of this discrepancy
are difficult to understand and therefore to predict. For
instance, shortly before the French students' revolt in May
1968, opinion polls gave an almost idyllic representation of
students' docility, conformism, and even satisfied apathy.

However, at an unconscious level, we can surmise that
there is a rationale in people's behavior which is buttressing
the maintenance of the social games and their social and
cultural characteristics, and these rationales can be
considered as more stable and meaningful value orientations.
These value orientations, however, cannot be easily made evident.
It will be a task for new generations of social scientists
to set these problems in more operational terms. For the moment,
we can only present some hypotheses that cannot be
supported by data and represent only educated guesses which
have been elaborated by confronting the problems to be
solved --- governability problems --- with the institutional patterns
and what we know of their evolution and the professed
values of people about them.

In this perspective, the first and most central hypothesis
concerns the concept of rationality and its relationship to
the structure of values. Western Europe, as the Western world
generally, has lived during the last two or three centuries with
a certain model of rationality which has had a decisive
influence on values, at least by giving them the basic structure
within which they could be expressed. This kind of
rationality, which can be considered as the most powerful
tool humanity had discovered for managing collective action,
is founded upon a clear distinction between ends and means
and an analytical fragmentation of problems within a world
that could be considered infinite. Within such a framework
people can define goals according to their preferences (i.e.,
their values). Society's technical knowledge could then
provide them with the necessary (and sufficient) means to
implement their goals. Every problem can be redefined in
such a way that ends and means may be clearly separate and
so that a rational solution could easily be found. Of course,
collective action implies several participants with different
orders of preferences. But in the economic sphere analytical
structuring will help sort out single deciders to whom others
will be linked by definite contracts (into which they will
enter according to their orders of preference). And in the
political sphere democratic procedures organized around the
twin concepts of general will and sovereignty give the
rationale for the same logic.

Of course difficulties can arise with this model of
rationality, and they may be (reluctantly) recognized. It will
be necessary, therefore, to resort to manipulation, compromise,
and even coercion in order to arrive at a decision. For
the elaboration of decisions, democracy can be viewed as
both the least evil and most ideal embodiment of rationality.
In order to achieve implementation of these decisions,
bureaucratic means are supposed to insure accurate and
impersonal compliance. Conflict over means may be another
worry, but-good leadership and energy will finally overcome
the obstacles. If there are failures, they are due to the
weakness of human nature and have to be tolerated as such.

As a general consequence a stable dichotomy has always
persisted between the ideal objectives which pertain to the
logic of values and the muddy, messy world of reality, which
is the realm of unsavory "political" deals. But the
discrepancy, although perturbing, does not shake this
fundamental model of reasoning. On the contrary, the more
ideals may be compromised in practice, the more idealized
and the more worshiped they will remain in the domain of
values.

The system has worked well enough as long as societal
change was slow, the intervention of public authorities rather
limited, and the fragmentation and stratification of society
strong enough to insure a pragmatic acceptance of social
order and established authority. But once the explosion of
communication and social interaction has disturbed the
necessary barriers that made societies more simple and
therefore more manageable, this basic pattern of rationality
disintegrates.

First, there is no way to order goals either rationally or
democratically. Furthermore, the quality and authenticity of
preferences and goals becomes questionable. It is all very well
to say that people should choose according to their
preferences. But where do these preferences come from? The
context of influences that is exerted over them appears to be
determinant. Manipulation becomes a sort of basic fear which
pervades the democratic creed. At the same time, social
sciences begin to question this preference model by showing
how people do not have _a priori_ wants but discover goals
from their experience; that is, they learn what they want by

trial and error and implementation schemes. Finally, ends
develop only through means.
Second, ends do not appear in a vacuum. They are part of
structured universes which also encompass means.
Furthermore, they are interrelated and conflictual. None of
them can be pushed very far without interfering with other
ends. Finally what are ends for one individual or one group
are means for other individuals or groups.

Third, the breakdown of barriers means that people
participate in very large structured sets where this unilateral
rationality scheme becomes terribly oppressive. If means,
according to the logic of this scheme, are the domain of inescapable
rational techniques, the 95 percent or 99 percent of
human beings whose universe does not go beyond these
means do not have the possibility to participate in a
meaningful way in the government of their daily lives. If
rational techniques can provide the one best solution, they
cannot even discuss the relevance of their experience for the
common good.

Fourth, rationality was always tempered by the limits of
tradition and custom, and by the fragmentation of the
problems. If limits disappear, if therefore rationality wins too
much, if established authority --- whether religious or social
--- crumbles, rationality explodes; it becomes in a certain sense
irrational.

If with this brief analysis of the crisis of modern
rationality as a goal-structuring scheme we revert to our
problems of governability of Western democracies, we can
draw a first set of conclusions. There is no wonder that the
concept of rationality has been put into question. Its own
success was bound to make its contradictions explode. The
cultural and moral breakdown of the late sixties therefore has
expressed something important for the future. Whatever its
vagaries and the dangerous threats it is presenting to the
democratic way of government, it has above all exposed the
illusions of traditional rationality and may help us learn a
new kind of reasoning where professed values will not be the
only guide for moral action.

The search for a broader kind of rationality, as well as the
search for new kinds of social and organizational games that
can embody it, is the major problem of Western societies.
New social and psychological utopias, such as the community
drive, the encounter group philosophy, and the
self-government dreams are useful tools for this search as well
as dangerous illusions. Conversely, political reemphasis of
local and regional ties may be as much a conservative "retro"
fashion as a necessary axis for the renewal of governmental
processes.

European societies, and U.S. society as well, are engaged in
this impossible search. European societies start, however,
with a handicap, inasmuch as they are still much more
involved in the former model of rationality, while the
rapidity of change is destroying the customary protections
that were counterbalancing its rigid use. These difficulties are
closely linked with social stratification problems, especially
the social gap between the world of decision and the world of
execution and the parallel but nonidentical gap between the
educated and the noneducated classes.

### Core Political Beliefs

If we distinguish core political beliefs from principles of
action, we discover a rather paradoxical situation which
may be emphasized as one basic characteristic of our
contemporary scene. While those principles of action that
seemed formerly immutable appear to be deeply shaken,
forcing people to open up to existential bewilderment about
the meaning of their action and their social identity, core
political beliefs about which changes had been always
hypothesized remain much more stable.

While people commonly feel that the usual way to achieve
goals is not acceptable any more (one cannot order people
around even if one pretends one can or even does), and while
community feelings seem much more important for young
people than the real content of any goal, the basic tenets of
the democratic and Christian creed. are still very much alive
and color revolutionary as well as conservative enterprises. In
this respect four clusters of values seem to me as
predominant now as they have been for a long time.

First, the freedom of the individual is the cardinal value
which is not only unanimously shared but seems to be
rediscovered again by any kind of new movement whether
extremely radical or conservatively religious. It will be
immediately argued that these movements have widely
different conceptions of freedom. But this is not so certain if
one remains at the level of values or core political beliefs. The
only fundamental distinction one can see at this point is the
opposition between the European conception of freedom
--- which is a sort of _freedom-from_, that is, emphasizing the
inalienable right of the individual not to be interfered
with --- and the American one --- which is rather a freedom-to,
that is, the inalienable right to take initiatives and to lead
others if they so wish. European _freedom-from_ antedates
political democracy and has deep Christian roots. It has
different forms according to the European country, with
some orientation of the more Protestant countries toward the
_freedom-to_ concept; but, on the whole, there is much more
convergence than one would think across countries and
across class barriers and political groupings.

Second, equality, whatever its ambiguity and possible
threats, remains a dominant value orientation all over
Western Europe, European egalitarianism, however, shows
again a difference from the American variety. It is still a
stratified kind of egalitarianism. People may require equality
with their peers most punctiliously while they may accept
inequality between statuses and strata. Contrary to North
Americans, they might be shocked by differences of
treatment that do not recognize people's status while they
would not mind the differences between statuses _per se_.

Order and efficiency may be more surprising items to put
among the core political beliefs of West Europeans. One
cannot escape being struck, however, with the importance of
these kinds of values in the political process. Whenever the
development of freedom threatens to bring chaos, the
demand for order is immediate, even violent. It is not a lost
or dwindling part of core political beliefs whatever the
possible evolution of its forms in the direction of more
tolerance. The special West European form of order,
however, has a more social and less juridical connotation
than in the United States. Things (and people) have to be put
in their proper place for society to operate. Due process is
not the cardinal element of this belief. Furthermore,
efficiency may be added to it inasmuch as it has a
legitimating connotation. Order is the way to achieve
efficiency, which is the condition of a well-functioning
society. West Europeans still value the good "efficient"
scheme more than the concrete results. Order is the burden
of the white man; efficiency may be the demonstration of it
in a modern rationalized society.

Finally, I would emphasize dualism as a fourth cluster of
core political beliefs. Contrary to Eastern countries, West
Europeans never had a unitary conception of legitimacy.
Church and State opposition antedates modern left-right
conflicts. Group cooperation may be dreamed of as a possible
unanimous harmony, but it has never been practiced without
the due protection of dualism. Free choice can be preserved
only if the existence of an opposition preserves the
independence of individuals who could be otherwise too
dependent on the predominant power to be able to assert
their rights. All situations where such an oppositon
disappears have to be avoided as paternalistic, feudalistic, and
oppressive. Conflict may be handled most painfully through
such dualism. Real conflicts may be stifled and distorted, but
one feels that the price is worth paying since prior harmony
is always suspect. This core belief, which is completely
foreign to Japan, is widely shared in North America, but the
American form of it emphasizes checks and balances more
than conflict and dualism. Absolute power in this conception
is evil and must therefore be checked, but this does not
necessarily imply the division of the citizens. In Europe this
division is the center of the game, and one can tolerate a
greater abuse of governmental prerogatives since government
will be paralyzed by the division of society.

### The Impact of Social, Economic, and Cultural Changes on the Principles of Rationality and on the Core Political Beliefs

Political behavior and political changes do not depend
directly on political values but on the possible learning
people can do within the constraints of the core political
beliefs they adhere to and the principles of rationality they
apply. What then may be, more precisely, the impact of
social, economic, and cultural changes on these two kinds of
societal dimensions?

All over Western Europe the development of social
interaction, the disruptive effects of cumulative change, the
cultural drift, and the exposure of government to media
publicity have made it more and more difficult to maintian
'social control and to answer the demands of the citizens.
Traditional rationality, therefore, disintegrates. But values or
core political beliefs are not affected. They may even be
reinforced.

The urge for freedom does not level off. On the contrary,
it may be intensified by the helplessness of uprooted
individuals within too complex world and their
concomitant blackmailing power over weakened institutions.
Not only is the demand for freedom exacerbated, but it does
not shift from a _freedom-from_ to a _freedom-to_ orientation.
The traditional posture still pays off.

The drive for equality, of course, develops; it may progress
from a narrow categorical frame of reference to a broader
one. But basically the tightness of the social and political
game is such that no significant shift can be expected in a
near . enough future. Conversely, the need for order is
reactivated by the chaotic aspect of a generalized
blackmailing game. And it is of a more regressive than
progressive kind. No learning seems to take place. As usual
people ask for freedom for themselves and order for the
others. Even dualism may be reinforced inasmuch as the
breakdown of rationality and the weakness of government
leave the field open for the game of division and opposition.

What is at stake, therefore, is not the democratic creed and
the Christian ethos, which are less directly threatened than
they were for example in the thirties,[^2/9] but the contradiction
between these core political beliefs and the principles of
action that could make it possible to implement them.

Earlier democratic processes had been built on the
separation of groups and classes. They relied as much on
institutionalized noncommunication as on democratic
confrontation. Authority was worshiped as an indispensable
means for achieving order although it was rejected as a
dangerous interference with freedom. Such a model could
not stand structural changes that destroy barriers, force
people to compete outside traditional limits, and suppress the
distance that protected traditional authority. A profound
contradiction therefore develops. People tend to try different
and more open practices or are being forced into them, but
they cannot stand the tensions these practices bring. Since
they cannot also stand the authority that could moderate
these tensions and bring back order over them, a very
resilient vicious circle develops. Little real learning takes
place, and authority hides behind public relations and
complexity but becomes more vulnerable because it does not
dare to assert itself. And the more vulnerable it becomes, the
more it generates blackmailing group pressures, the less
margin it retains for more responsible longer-term action and
the less chance it stands to regain legitimacy.

New patterns of tolerance and mutual adjustment have to
be learned and are in fact being learned to deal with these
growing tensions and the chaotic consequences they can have
if the easy solution of inflation is not available. But this
cannot take place yet at the level of values or the core belief
system. We can only hope that action will anticipate beliefs,
that is, that people will learn from experience instead of
obeying already existing motivations. This kind of learning is
perfectly compatible with the core belief system although it
implies some shift from the _freedom-from_ concept to the
_freedom-to_ concept and the extension of the traditional
narrow egalitarianism to broader domains. Nevertheless, it
would mean the appearance of new beliefs alongside the core
system. If such learning does not develop quickly enough,
however, there is a growing risk of crisis and regression.

### Traditional Factors As a Counterweight

European societies still live on a series of traditional
adjustments that are not called into question because they
are taken for granted: the persistence of old forms of
patronage networks which allow due consideration to
forgotten human factors; symbiotic adjustments between
opposed social and economic partners according to which
conflicts and tensions are maintained at a workable level;
implicit bargaining arrangements between groups that cannot
face each other squarely; implicit consensus on some sort of
professional or work ethic, and so on.

There is, moreover, a longing and a search for earlier
community practices to be rediscovered and revived, a
longing and search which testify to the need of finding more
roots at a time when the acceleration of change destroys the
support as well as the constraints around which humanity
could find meaning. On the whole, however, Western Europe
seems to be worse off than either Japan or North America.
Japan still benefits from the existence of a huge capital of
collective capacity upon which it can rely. North America
does not have this capital of tradition; but even if it suffers
from some of the same problems Western Europe has to face,
it has had more time to learn, and it benefits from more slack
in its social and economic system which allows it to
experiment more easily. Western Europe has used up a lot
more of its own reserves than Japan and does not have the
learning experience and the learning capacity of the United
States. It should, therefore, be much more careful with
whatever resources is has and invest as much as it can to
develop them and learn new patterns of adjustment. It does
not have time to wait; it must learn and learn as quickly as
possible. A purely defensive strategy would be suicidal
because the risk of regression is a very concrete one.

### The Risks of Social and Political Regression

Western Europe has known already a tragic period of
regression when the chaotic and effervescent world born out
of World War I could not face its tensions, especially those of
the depression, and when its needs for order were met by
recourse to the fascist and Nazi regressions. Fascism and
Nazism can be analyzed as a return to older forms of
authority to restore or impose the indispensable order. This
was associated with a sudden shift in patterns of behavior
reactivating those which were closer to earlier types.

\ 

_Can Western Europe suffer another such setback?_

\ 

Certainly not in the same form and in the same direction.
There is little left in the present core beliefs in which to find
support. There is no strong will, no sense of mission, no real
dedication to fight for the restoration of an earlier moral
order; there is not so much will to fight for capitalism or even
for free enterprise as such. No strong movement can be
expected therefore from right-wing "reactionary"
background.

But regression can come also from the left for two
converging reasons: The communist parties have emerged
more and more as the parties of order, whose leaders are the
only ones able to make people work, and there has always
been a very strong tendency to develop state socialism and
public - bureaucracy interference as the easy solution to
manage the impossible, that is, to maintain order in the face
of unmanageable conflicts.

These affirmations may seem paradoxical. The communist
parties generally have lost ground or leveled off almost
everywhere in Western Europe. Their ideology does not have
the same appearance any more. It looks very much like a
routinized church whose charisma has at least partially
disappeared. Why should such sedate and moderate parties
be a threat to democracy just at the time they are beginning
to respect its basic tenets?

The strength of the present communist parties of Western
Europe does not lie, however, either in their revolutionary
appeal or in their electoral capabilities. They must have
enough of them certainly. But their unique superiority is
their organizational one. They are the only institutions left in
Western Europe where authority is not questioned, where a
primitive but very efficient chain of command can
manipulate a docile workforce, where there is a capacity to
take hard decisions and adjust quickly, and where goods can
be delivered and delays respected.

Authority may be heavy-handed in these parties and the
close atmosphere they have maintained over their people has
certainly been a brake to their development. Turnover has
always been considerable. But granted these costs, their
machine has remained extraordinarily efficient and its superiority
has tremendously increased when other major institutions
have begun to disintegrate. There is now no other
institution in Europe, not even the state bureaucracies, that
can match the communist parties' capabilities in this domain.

True enough, as long as the problem of order does not
become central, they are out of the game; but if chaos should
develop for a long enough time following a greater economic
depression, they can provide the last solution. Most European
countries have always had a very strong tradition of state
control and bureaucratic procedures to substitute for their
political systems' weaknesses. While bureaucracy may be
anathema for the majority of people in opinion polls, it is
still the easy solution for any kind of problem. This, of
course, may be more true for France and Britain, but it is
also true in the smaller countries and Germany, which, while
it has moved away from state socialism, still has a strong
tradition to which one can appeal.

For some of the Western countries the idea of
nationalization, after years of oblivion and little ideological
appeal, has become an issue again. In time of political chaos
and economic depression it may appear as the last recourse to
save employment and to equalize sacrifices. The communist
parties are certainly better trained to administer the resulting
confusion and to restore order to leaderless organizations.
They will win then not because of their appeal but by default
because the communists are the only ones capable of filling
the void.

They have already shown proof of their capabilities. For
instance they have shown remarkable efficiency in
administering various cities in Italy and France; they have
helped to restore order in Italian, French, and even German
universities; and they have shown everywhere, even in
Britain, how to influence key trade unions by using minority
control devices. Their potential, therefore, is much higher at
that level than it is at the electoral level or at the
revolutionary level. And because of this potential they can
attract experts and professionals of high caliber and also
increase their capabilities on the technical side.

Nevertheless, the communists do have problems. The most
pressing one is the danger of being contaminated by the
general trends of the societies in which they have to operate,
that is, to be unable to prevent the disintegration of their
model of authority. This is why they take such great care to
maintain their revolutionary identity. They have been
protected by their minority ghetto-like status and as long as
they can maintain it, their hard core membership has so
deeply internalized their so far successful practices that they
can stand the pressure of the environment for quite a long
time.

They have a difficult game to play, 'nevertheless. They
must be enough in to be present when high stakes are at
issue, while remaining sufficiently _out_ to maintain their
organizational capacity. Their basic weakness lies in their
difficulty in respecting the _freedom-from_ belief and their
incapacity to accept dualism. Can they govern and control
societies whose core political beliefs are alien to them?
Wouldn't they trigger an extremely strong backlash? It is a
difficult question to answer because these societies are in the
midst of a deep cultural transformation which affects, with
the principles of rationality, the basis of their political
strategy.

Let us just suggest that if the takeover would be sudden,
an anticommunist backlash would be likely; but if the
breakdown would be intensive and profound but also
gradual, the communists coming to power could be very
difficult to question.

## CONCLUSIONS: EUROPEAN VULNERABILITY

This review of some of the major problems of
governability in Western Europe may suffer from an overly
pessimistic overtone. By focusing on the more intractable
problems one is easily led to overemphasize contradictions
and to give the misleading impression that breakdowns are
soon likely to occur.

To present a more balanced conclusion, we would put
these analyses in a more general perspective. The problems of
European societies are difficult to solve but they are not
intractable, and European Societies, whatever their
weaknesses, do still possess a lot of resources that can be
mobilized when wanted. They have already shown during the
contemporary period considerable - resilience and an
unexpected capacity to adapt, to adjust, and to invent. Right
now they still manage to maintain democratic stability
against very difficult odds. And during the past twenty years
they have carried through a very impressive mutation that
few observers would have trusted them to accomplish. If
there was no external constraint, there would be no reason to
believe they could not accomplish the second mutation that
seems necessary now.

The basic situation, therefore, that should concern us is
not so much the intractability of the problems and the
incapacity of the European societies to meet the challenge; it
is the vulnerability of Europe. Indeed, all European nations
have to live through the same impossible situation: _They have
to carry through a basic mutation in their model of
government and their mode of social control while facing at
the same time a crisis from within and a crisis from without._

European nations have different capacities and some of
them at first glance seem more likely to succeed than others.
But none of them has the leeway and resources of the United
States or the collective capacity of action of Japan.
Furthermore, they are so interdependent that, while they can
help and emulate each other strongly, they are partially
dependent on the vulnerability of the weakest link in the
chain.

The crisis from within revolves, of course, basically around
economic and social instability. Inflation at the rate it has
reached increases the tensions it had alleviated formerly. Its
disruptive effects undermine the basis of the social bond
because of the loss of trust and the impossibility to plan
ahead. But too much deflation would force an impossible
reallocation of resources and/or raise unemployment to an
unacceptable level. Countries are therefore in an impossible
vicious circle, which it is very difficult for them to break
without entering a deeper depression, and whose risks seem
impossible to accept in view of the fragility of their social
fabric.

Managing such a crisis imposes the need to give priority to
short-term considerations and makes it all the more difficult
to meet the more basic challenge of the necessary mutation
of social controls.

This is, of course, compounded by the consequences of the
crisis from without which is not only the crisis of energy and
the crisis of the balance of payments but the relative
situation of weakness of the European nations whose welfare
is for the first time directly dependent on outside pressures
from non-Western powers. Here again the failure of one or
two countries can be managed with the help of the strongest,
but if France, for example, would follow, the whole
European system would crumble.

In such a difficult situation, state socialism may appear to
be the easiest solution for some countries, especially the
Latin ones, since it would give workers guarantees and help
spread out employment. But such a course of action, a
possibility which must be taken very seriously, would trigger
a period of social chaos in which the communist parties
would play a decisive role because they would be the only
ones capable of bringing back order and efficiency. This
scenario, of course, could not apply to the whole of Europe,
but it could quickly spread to Italy, France, and Spain and
put unbearable pressure on Germany. At that time Finlandization
would appear as the least evil.

Such a disastrous drifting of Western Europe is not
inevitable. It is not even likely, but the fact that the
possibility must be taken seriously is a measure of the present
vulnerability of Europe. To prevent it, European nations
should try to go beyond their present dire constraints and
face at the same time the challenges of the future.

First, they should try to accelerate the shift away from
their old model of fragmentation, stratification, secrecy, and
distance, which produced an acceptable balance between
democratic processes, bureaucratic authority, and some
aristocratic tradition, and experiment with more flexible
models that could produce more social control with less
coercive pressure. Such experimentation, which is bound to
succeed in the long run, looks dangerous in the present
vulnerable situation when we hesitate naturally to jeopardize
what remains of the old means of social control as long as
one is not sure of the quality of the new means. Innovation,
nevertheless, seems to be absolutely indispensable. It has to
be careful innovation, but it is the only possible answer to
Europe's dilemma.

European nations should at the same time try to reorient
the trend of economic growth. They badly need to maintain
growth to prevent unemployment and an exacerbation of
social conflicts, but they cannot maintain the type of growth
of preceding years which has brought more and more costly
disruptions and can be considered one of the important
causes of inflation. A new emphasis on quality, on collective
amenities, on a more careful allocation of space is not
impossible. New goals for facing the future can be given
priority: modernizing the education process; improving
community and regional decision-making; establishing more
responsible information systems; radically changing working
conditions and restoring the status of manual work;
developing income maintenance programs; making public
bureaucracies responsible to the citizens and private
bureaucracies to the consumers.

The diverse background and history of the different
European nations can be viewed as an asset for such
endeavors since there exists among them a tremendous
reservoir of experience and of capable talents. European
interdependence, on the other hand, forces European nations
to face the impossible problem of unity. A united Europe
was for a long time the ideal dream to help maintain the drive
to overcome the outdated modes of government that
prevailed in the national state systems. But the advocates of
European unity have stumbled too long on the obstacle of
the central states' nodal power, which the present crises have
reinforced even more, to maintain hope for the near future.

Investments in a European common capacity remain
nevertheless indispensable not only for Europe's sake but for
each country's capacity to overcome its own narrow
determinisms. Can they be made in view of the present
pressure? This may be the most difficult question. It may
certainly be helped in any case by a better appreciation in
the two other regions of the difficulty of their partners'
problem and by their willingness to help solve it.

contemporary French politician well known for his skillful use of the
system used to sum up this practice by saying, "Let's muddle it up a
little more."

[^2/2]: This seems to be one basic weakness of the Lindblom model in
_The Intelligence of Democracy_: it does not give due attention to the
way the field in which adjustments take place is structured and
regulated. Sensible partisan mutual adjustments take place only within
fields which a minimum of structure and regulation has neutralized.
Chaos will only bring chaos. Good "partisan mutual adjustment"
systems are a construct, as is any kind of market.

[^2/4]: To some extent Switzerland might be an interesting exception,
which is a lasting testimony to the exceptional strength of its
decentralized local decision-making system.

[^2/5]: This proposition is very difficult to substantiate since each
country may rate differently on the diverse categories of a very
complex social universe. One can argue that class differences are still
stronger in Britain and Germany than in France. It seems however that
French institutions and organizational systems still rely more on
hierarchical mechanisms that their counterparts in Britain and
Germany. The crumbling of social barriers in any case has been more
spectacular in France and Italy in one of the key areas of modern
change, the universities. The influx of students in these two countries
has been much higher in the sixties than in Britain and Germany, with a
concomitant breakdown of social control.

[^2/6]: This is certainly one of the reasons for the development of
inflation, which is the consequence of the disruption of traditional
social regulation as much as it is a cause of it.

[^2/7]: One should, of course, add that the economic gains of blue-collar
workers in these countries have been comparatively much higher, but
there is no point opposing the two series of causes, which are
intertwined and do reinforce each other.

[^2/9]: One may argue that they are eroded, but I personally feel that
they have fewer defenders because nobody attacks them and even more
because everybody agrees so much that they are taken for granted.
