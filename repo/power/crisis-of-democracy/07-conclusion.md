# CONCLUSION

## THE CHANGING CONTEXT OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT

If ever there was a democratic success story, it was written
by the Trilateral societies during the quarter-century
following World War II. The components of that success
included: generally positive and broadgauged political
leadership within individual countries and by the United
States for the community of democratic nations; sustained
and, for some countries, spectacular economic growth;
widespread social and economic amelioration, involving a
lessening of class conflict and the assimilation of substantial
portions of the population to middle-class values, attitudes,
and consumption patterns; and successful resistance, on a
collective and individual basis, to the challenges posed
externally by Soviet military might and internally by
communist party strength. During these years democratic
institutions, mostly of a parliamentary nature, demonstrated
their viability in all the Trilateral societies; liberal,
conservative, social democratic, and christian democratic
parties competed with each other in regular elections and
shared the responsibilities of government and the
opportunities for opposition; individual citizens and
organized groups participated more actively in the politics
of their societies than they had previously; the rights of the
citizen against the state became more firmly guaranteed and
protected; and new institutions for international collaboration
among democratic societies emerged in Europe for economic
and political purposes, between North America and Europe for
military purposes, and among Europe, North America, and
Japan for economic purposes.

This happy congruence of circumstances for democracy
has come to an end. The challenges which democratic
governments now face are the products of these past
successes as well as of the changes in past trends. The
incorporation of substantial elements of the population into
the middle classes has escalated their expectations and
aspirations, thereby causing a more intense reaction if these
are not met in reality. Broadened political participation has
increased the demands on government. Widespread material
well-being has caused a substantial portion of the population,
particularly among the young and the "intellectual"
professional classes, to adopt new life-styles and new
social-political values. Internationally, confrontation has
given way to d√©tente, with a resultant relaxation of
constraints within societies and of the impetus to collaborate
among societies. There has been a substantial relative decline
in American military and economic power, and a major
absolute decline in American willingness to assume the
burdens of leadership. And most recently, the temporary
slowdown in economic growth has threatened the
expectations created by previous growth, while still leaving
existent the "postbourgeois" values which it engendered
among the youth and intellectuals.

## CONSENSUS WITHOUT PURPOSE: THE RISE OF ANOMIC DEMOCRACY

Dissatisfaction with and lack of confidence in the
functioning of the institutions of democratic government
have thus now become widespread in Trilateral countries. Yet
with all this dissatisfaction, no significant support has yet
developed for any alternative image of how to organize the
politics of a highly industrialized society. Before World War
II both right-wing and left-wing movements set forth
clear-cut political alternatives to the "decadent" institutions
of "bourgeois" parliamentary democracy. Today those
institutions are accepted even if they are not praised. The
active proponents of a different vision of the political order
are, by and large, limited to small bands of radical students
and intellectuals whose capacity to attract attention through
propaganda and terrorism is heavily outweighed by their
incapacity to attract support from any significant social
groups. In Japan, the 1947 "occupation" Constitution is now
accepted as the way in which Japanese politics will be
organized for the foreseeable future. In Europe, even the
French and Italian communist parties have adapted
themselves to the democratic game and at least assert that if
admitted to power they will continue to play according to
the rules of that game. No significant social or political group
in a Trilateral society seriously proposes to replace existing
democratic institutions with a nationalist autocracy, the
corporate state, or even the dictatorship of the proletariat.
The lack of confidence in democratic institutions is clearly
exceeded by the lack of enthusiasm for any alternative set of
institutions.

What is in short supply in democratic societies today is
thus not consensus on the rules of the game but a sense of
purpose as to what one should achieve by playing the game.
In the past, people have found their purposes in religion, in
nationalism, and in ideology. But neither church, nor state,
nor class now commands people's loyalties. In some measure,
democracy itself was inspired by and its institutions shaped
by manifestations of each of these forces and commitments.
Protestantism sanctified the individual conscience; nationalism
postulated the equality of citizens; and liberalism
provided the rationale for limited government based on
consent. But now all three gods have failed. We have
witnessed the dissipation of religion, the withering away of
nationalism, the decline --- if not the end --- of class-based ideology.

In a nondemocratic political system, the top leadership
can select a single purpose or closely related set of goals and,
in some measure, induce or coerce political and social forces
to shape their behavior in terms of the priorities dictated
by these goals. Third World dictatorships can direct their
societies towards the "overriding" goal of national development;
communist states can mobilize their populace
for the task of "building socialism." In a democracy,
however, purpose cannot be imposed from on high by fiat;
nor does it spring to life from the verbiage of party
platforms, state of the union messages, or speeches from the
throne. It must, instead, be the product of the collective
perception by the significant groups in society of a major
challenge to their well-being and the perception by them that
this challenge threatens them all about equally. Hence, in
wartime or periods of economic catastrophe, common purposes
are easily defined. During World War II and then the
cold war, there was a general acceptance in the United States
of the overriding priority of national security as a goal. In
Europe and Japan, after World War II, economic reconstruction
and development were supported as goals by virtually all
major groups in society. World war, economic reconstruction,
and the cold war gave coherence to public purposes and imposed
a set of priorities for ordering government policies
and programs. Now, however, these purposes have lost their
salience and even come under challenge; the imperatives of
national security are no longer obvious, the desirability of
economic growth is no longer unquestioned.

In this situation, the machinery of democracy continues to
operate, but the ability of the individuals operating that
machinery to make decisions tends to deteriorate. Without
common purpose, there is no basis for common priorities,
and without priorities, there are no grounds for distinguishing
among competing private interests and claims. Conflicting
goals and specialized interests crowd in one upon another,
with executives, cabinets, parliaments, and bureaucrats
lacking the criteria to discriminate among them. The system
becomes one of anomic democracy, in which democratic
politics becomes more an arena for the assertion of
conflicting interests than a process for the building of
common purposes.

## THE DYSFUNCTIONS OF DEMOCRACY

Quite apart from the substantive policy issues confronting
democratic government, many specific problems have arisen
which seem to be an intrinsic part of the functioning of
democracy itself. The successful operation of democratic
government has given rise to tendencies which impede that
functioning.

(1) The pursuit of the democratic virtues of equality and
individualism has led to the delegitimation of
authority generally and the loss of trust in leadership.
(2) The democratic expansion of political participation
and involvement has created an "overload" on
government and the imbalanced expansion of
governmental activities, exacerbating inflationary
tendencies in the economy.
(3) The political competition essential to democracy has
intensified, leading to a disaggregation of interests
and the decline and fragmentation of political parties.
(4) The responsiveness of democratic government to the
electorate and to societal pressures encourages
nationalistic parochialism in the way in which
democratic societies conduct their foreign relations.

### The Delegitimation of Authority

In most of the Trilateral countries in the past decade there
has been a decline in the confidence and trust which the
people have in government, in their leaders, and, less clearly
but most importantly, in each other. Authority has been
challenged not only in government, but in trade unions,
business enterprises, schools and universities, professional
associations, churches, and civic groups. In the past, those
institutions which have played the major role in the
indoctrination of the young in their rights and obligations as
members of society have been the family, the church, the
school, and the army. The effectiveness of all these
institutions as a means of socialization has declined severely.
The stress has been increasingly on individuals and their
rights, interests, and needs, and not on the community and
its rights, interests, and needs. These attitudes have been
particularly prevalent in the young, but they have also
appeared in other age groups, especially among those who
have achieved professional, white-collar, and middle-class
status. The success of the existing structures of authority in
incorporating large elements of the population into the
middle class, paradoxically, strengthens precisely those
groups which are disposed to challenge the existing structures
of authority.

The democratic spirit is egalitarian, individualistic,
populist, and impatient with the distinctions of class and
rank. The spread of that spirit weakens the traditional threats
to democracy posed by such groups as the aristocracy, the
church, and the military. At the same time, a pervasive spirit
of democracy may pose an intrinsic threat and undermine all
forms of association, weakening the social bonds which hold
together family, enterprise, and community. Every social
organization requires, in some measure, inequalities in
authority and distinctions in function. To the extent that the
spread of the democratic temper corrodes all of these,
exercising a leveling and an homogenizing influence, it
destroys the bases of trust and cooperation among citizens
and creates obstacles to collaboration for any common
purpose.

Leadership is in disrepute in democratic societies. Without
confidence in its leadership, no group functions effectively.
When the fabric of leadership weakens among other groups in
society, it is also weakened at the top political levels of
government. The governability of a society at the national
level depends upon the extent to which it is effectively
governed at the subnational, regional, local, functional, and
industrial levels. In the modern state, for instance, powerful
trade union "bosses" are often viewed as a threat to the
power of the state. In actuality, however, responsible union
leaders with effective authority over their members are less of
a challenge to the authority of the national political leaders
than they are a prerequisite to the exercise of authority by
those leaders. If the unions are disorganized, if the
membership is rebellious, if extreme demands and wild-cat
strikes are the order of the day, the formulation and
implementation of a national wage policy become impossible.
The weakening of authority throughout society thus
contributes to the weakening of the authority of government.

### The Overloading of Government

Recent years in the Trilateral countries have seen the
expansion of the demands on government from individuals
and groups. The expansion takes the form of: (1) the
involvement of an increasing proportion of the population in
political activity; (2) the development of new groups and of
new consciousness on the part of old groups, including
youth, regional groups, and ethnic minorities; (3) the
diversification of the political means and tactics which groups
use to secure their ends; (4) an increasing expectation on the
part of groups that government has the responsibility to meet
their needs; and (5) an escalation in what they conceive
those needs to be.

The result is an "overload" on government and the
expansion of the role of government in the economy and
society. During the 1960s governmental expenditures, as a
proportion of GNP, increased significantly in all the principal
Trilateral countries, except for Japan. This expansion of
governmental activity was attributed not so much to the
strength of government as to its weakness and the inability
and unwillingness of central political leaders to reject the
demands made upon them by numerically and functionally
important groups in their society. The impetus to respond to
the demands which groups made on government is deeply
rooted in both the attitudinal and structural features of a
democratic society. The democratic idea that government
should be responsive to the people creates the expectation
that government should meet the needs and correct the evils
affecting particular groups in society. Confronted with the
structural imperative of competitive elections every few
years, political leaders can hardly do anything else.

Inflation is obviously not a problem which is peculiar to
democratic societies, and it may well be the result of causes
quite extrinsic to the democratic process. It may, however,
be exacerbated by a democratic politics and it is, without
doubt, extremely difficult for democratic systems to deal
with effectively. The natural tendency of the political
demands permitted and encouraged by the dynamics of a
democratic system helps governments to deal with the
problems of economic recession, particularly unemployment,
and it hampers them in dealing effectively with inflation. In
the face of the claims of business groups, labor unions, and
the beneficiaries of governmental largesse, it becomes
difficult if not impossible for democratic governments to
curtail spending, increase taxes, and control prices and wages.
In this sense, inflation is the economic disease of
democracies.

### The Disaggregation of Interests

A primary function of politics is to aggregate the various
interests in society so as to promote common purposes and
to create coalitions behind policies and leaders. In a
democratic society this process takes place through
complicated processes of bargaining and compromise within
government, within and between the political parties, and
through electoral competition. The multiple sources of power
in a democratic society insure that any policy decision, when
it is made, usually has to have at least the tacit support of a
majority of those affected by and concerned with it. In this
sense, consensus-building is at the heart of democratic
politics. At the same time, however, the opportunities which
democratic politics offers to particular opinions, interests,
and groups to be represented in the political process
necessarily tend to stimulate the formulation and articulation
of such opinions, interests, and groups. While the common
interest is in compromise and consensus, it is often beneficial
to the particular individual or group to differentiate its
interest from other interests, to assert that interest
vigorously, and at times to be intransigent in defending that
interest against others. In a democracy, in short, the top
political leaders work to aggregate interests; the political
process often works to disaggregate them.

The most obvious political manifestation of the
disaggregation of interests and the withering away of
common purposes is in the decomposition which has affected
the political party systems in Trilateral societies. In almost
every country the support for the principal established
political parties has declined, and new parties, small parties,
and antiparty movements have gained in strength. At one
time or another during 1974, no party had a majority in the
legislatures of Great Britain, Canada, France, the Federal
Republic of Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands,
Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. And the functional
equivalent to the lack of a majority existed in the United
States with different parties in control of the executive and
legislative branches of the government. This failure of the
party system to produce electoral and parliamentary majorities
obviously had adverse effects on the ability of govern¬∑ments
to govern.

A party system is a way of organizing the electorate,
simplifying choice, selecting leaders, aggregating interests,
and shaping policy choices and priorities. The development
of political parties in the nineteenth century went hand-inhand
with the expansion of the suffrage and the increased
responsibility of governments to their citizens. Parties made
democratic government possible. Throughout the twentieth
century, the strength of democracy has varied with the
strength of the political parties committed to working within
a democratic system. The decay of political party systems
in the industrialized world poses the question: How viable is
democratic government without parties or with greatly
weakened and attenuated parties?

### Parochialism in International Affairs

Just as the opportunities afforded by the democratic
process tended to increase the strength and assertiveness of
particularistic groups domestically, so they also tended to
encourage a greater degree of parochialism in international
affairs.

The seeming decline in the external military threat
produced a general slackening of concern throughout the
Trilateral countries with the problems of security. In the
absence of a clear and present danger to security, it is very
difficult to mobilize support within a democracy for
measures which may be necessary to provide for security. In
the European and North American countries, compulsory
military service has been reduced or abandoned entirely;
military expenditures have declined in real terms and relative
to national product; antimilitarism has become the vogue in
intellectual and political circles. Yet d√©tente presumably rests
upon the achievement of a rough military balance between
the communist powers and the democracies. During the
1960s the military exertions of the communist powers
brought such a balance into being and hence made d√©tente
feasible. During the 1970s military passivity on the part of
the democracies could well undermine that balance and
hence the basis for improved relations with the communist
states.

By and large, the quarter-century after World War II saw a
removal of restrictions on trade and investment, and a general
opening up of the economies of the industrialized, capitalist
countries. In times of economic scarcity, inflation, and
possible long-term economic downturn, however, the
pressures in favor of nationalism and neo-mercantilism mount
and democratic political systems find themselves particularly
vulnerable to such pressures from industry groups, localities,
and labor organizations, which see themselves adversely
affected by foreign competition. The ability of governments
to deal with domestic social and economic problems is
reduced, as well as the confidence people have that
legislatures will be able to deal with those problems. As a
result, the leaders of democratic governments turn
increasingly to foreign policy as the one arena where they can
achieve what appear to be significant successes. Diplomatic
triumph becomes essential to the maintenance of domestic
power; success abroad produces votes at home. Heath and
the Common Market, Brandt and the Moscow treaties, Nixon
in Peking and SALT I, and Pompidou in challenging
American leadership may or may not have done the best in
terms of securing the long-term interests of their countries,
but their domestic political needs left them little leeway not
to come up with something. At the same time, the impact of
inflation and domestic special interests engenders economic
nationalism increasing the difficulties of cooperative action
among the democratic powers. Given these pressures, the
extent to which the democratic societies have been able to
avoid the worst forms of beggar-thy-neighbor policies and
devise some common responses to the economic and energy
crises is, in many respects, quite remarkable. Yet the impact
of domestic politics still leads democratic leaders to display
greater eagerness to compromise when negotiating with their
enemies and to have greater difficulty in compromising when
they negotiate with each other.

While the processes of democratic politics induce
governmental leaders to look abroad for victories to sustain
them at home, those same processes also tend to produce a
tendency towards greater provincialism and nationalism in
their outlook. The parochialization of leadership is surely
one of the most striking trends of the past decade in the
Trilateral democracies. Down through the early 1960s,
leading statesmen in the democratic countries not only had
(as was a prerequisite to statesmanship) a standing among
their own people, but they also often had an appeal and a
standing abroad among people in the other industrialized
democracies. They were, in a sense, Trilateral statesmen as
well as national statesmen. The resignation of Willy Brandt,
however, removed from the scene the last of the democratic
leaders who had a stature, a reputation, and a following that
transcended his own society. This is not to say that the
current leaders are necessarily narrowly nationalistic in their
outlook and policies. It does mean, however, that they are
the product of peculiarly national processes and that
whatever their qualities as leaders, the names of Gerald Ford,
Takeo Miki, Harold Wilson, Giscard d'Estaing, and Helmut
Schmidt do not inspire enthusiasm and commitment outside
their own societies.

## VARIATIONS AMONG REGIONS

The features we have described above are found in all three
rilateral regions. The relative intensity of the different
aspects of the problem varies, however, from country to
country and from time to time within a country. The overall
legitimacy of government is greater in Britain than in
Italy. Confidence and trust in political institutions and
leaders in the United States was much less during the 1960s
and early 1970s than it was in the 1940s and 1950s and very
probably considerably less than it will be during the coming
years. The differing cultures and political traditions of the
various countries means that each problem concerning the
governability of democracy manifests itself in different ways
and has to be dealt with by different means. Each country
has its own peculiar strengths and weaknesses. In continental
Europe and in Japan, for instance, there is a tradition of a
strong and effective bureaucracy, in part because of the
polarization and fragmentation among political parties. This
bureaucracy furnishes continuity and stability to the system,
functioning in some ways as both a gyroscope and an
automatic pilot. In Britain and the United States, on the
other hand, there are strong traditions of citizen participation
in politics which insure the vitality of democracy at the same
time that they may lower the competence and authority of
government. If one were to generalize, one might say that the
problem in the United States is more one of governability
than of democracy, in Japan it is more one of democracy
than of governability, while in Europe both problems are
acute.

The demands on government and the needs for government
have been increasing steadily in all the Trilateral societies.
The cause of the current malaise is the decline in the
material resources and political authority available to government
to meet these demands and needs. These deficiencies
vary significantly, however, from region to region. In the
United States, the government is constrained more by the
shortage of authority than by the shortage of resources. In
Japan, the government has so far been favored with a huge increase
in resources due to rapid economic growth, and it has
been able to utilize the reservoir of traditional acquiescence
among the people to support its authority. The growth in resources,
however, is about to stop, and the reservoir of acquiescence
is more and more draining down. In Europe, governments
seem to be facing shortages of both authority and
resources, which is the major reason why the problems concerning
the governability of democracy are more urgent in
Europe than in the other Trilateral regions.

At the moment the principal strains on the governability
of democracy may be receding in the United States, cresting
in Europe, and pending in the future for Japan. During the
1960s, the United States went through a period of creedal
passion, of intense conflict over racial issues and the
Indochina War, and of marked expansion in the extent and
forms of political participation. In addition, in the 1970s the
United States suffered a major constitutional crisis in the
whole complex of issues involved in Watergate and the
resignation of the President. At present, much of the passion
and intensity has departed from American politics, leaving
the political leadership and institutions with the problem of
attempting to redefine their functions in altered circumstances,
to restore the prestige and authority of central
government institutions, and to grapple with the immediate
economic challenges. Japan, on the other hand, appears to
still have some time before the major challenges to
democracy will come to a head, which they probably will in
the early 1980s. Its organizational fabric and patterns of
social control, moreover, provide advantages in giving control
and direction to the new political forces and demands on
government. This gain in time will give the existing
democratic institutions in Japan opportunity to consolidate
themselves further and will permit the party leaders in all the
major parties to adapt to a situation in which the Liberal
Democratic party no longer commands a secure majority.

Europe, in contrast, has to face current issues which make
it the most vulnerable of the three regions at the present
time. It must make long-term investments quickly inasmuch
as it will not be able to handle its problems with the current
resources it has available. In addition, it must maintain tight
enough control over short-run issues since it has to face a
crisis from within as well as a crisis from without.
