# APPENDIX

## APPENDIX I: DISCUSSION OF STUDY DURING PLENARY MEETING OF THE TRILATERAL COMMISSION --- _Kyoto, May 31, 1975_

The study by Michel Crozier, Samuel P. Huntington, and
Joji Watanuki, prepared for the Trilateral Commission, was
discussed during plenary meetings of the Commission in
Kyoto, Japan in May 1975: This three-part appendix is aimed
at advancing dialogue on the issues involved. The first part
lists some "arenas for action" prepared as points of departure
for the Kyoto discussion; the second provides remarks by
Ralf Dahrendorf, who opened the discussion in Kyoto; and
the third summarizes discussion of the report among members
of the Commission.

### ARENAS FOR ACTION

While there is much to praise in the performance of
democratic government in the Trilateral societies, there are
also areas of critical weakness and potential breakdown. The
heart of the problem lies in the inherent contradictions
involved in the very phrase "governability of democracy."
For, in some measure, governability and democracy are
warring concepts. An excess of democracy means a deficit in
governability; easy governability suggests faulty democracy.
At times in the history of democratic government the
pendulum has swung too far in one direction or the other.

At the present time, it appears that the balance has tilted
too far against governments in Western Europe and the
United States; in Japan, as yet, this problem is not acute,
although it may well become so. The United States and
Western Europe consequently need to restore a more
equitable relationship between governmental authority and
popular control, and Japan may face this necessity in the
not-too-distant future. The steadily rising need for
government to manage the interrelations of a complex
society is likely to require an increase in the material
resources and political authority available to government. In
the United States and Western Europe, both have been in
short supply already. Even in Japan, both will be in short
supply in the future. There are at least seven areas in which
these problems can be tackled, which are relevant
immediately to Europe and the United States and in the
not-too-remote future also to Japan.

1. Effective Planning for Economic and Social Development

The historical record indicates that democracy works
best --- indeed, that it may only work --- when there is a
gradual but relatively constant increase in the economic
well-being of society. The record of the recent past suggests
that in industrialized societies each additional increment in
the rate of economic growth tends to be distributed in order
to provide more benefits to the poor than the previous
increment. Reasonable rates of economic growth and
relatively stable prices are essential for the achievement of
socioeconomic equity. The control of inflation and the
promotion of economic growth, taking into careful
consideration the effects of such growth on resource
exhaustion and environmental pollution, consequently must
have top priority on the agenda of democracy. In addition,
poverty remains a problem in many parts of Europe and the
United States, and governmental programs must give the
highest priority to establishing a minimum floor of
guaranteed subsistence for all citizens. The specific measures
by which governments can promote these goals must be
devised by economists and planners, but critical consideration
should be given to proposals such as that recently
advanced in the United States for a new economic planning
agency attached to the White House. It is necessary here
simply to underline the extent to which the governability of
democracy seems dependent upon the sustained expansion of
the economy. Political democracy requires economic growth;
economic growth without inflation depends upon effective
democratic planning. The opportunities for more effective
planning are not, moreover, simply confined to issues of
economic growth. The trilateral societies have an accumulation
of social knowledge which could be used for solution
of some social problems. The governments in Trilateral
societies have the possibility of becoming "wiser" in allocating
scarce resources in the most effective way, searching for
alternatives, and assessing the effects of policies, through
proper use of the social knowledge and skills which have been
accumulated and may still be developed.

2. Strengthening the Institutions of Political Leadership

In recent years, the publics in the Trilateral societies have
expected much of their political leaders. They have been
expected to "deliver the goods" in terms of achieving policy
outputs and outcomes to which they have committed
themselves and their governments. In many instances,
however, political leaders have been left deficient in the
institutional resources and authority necessary to achieve
these goals. A pervasive suspicion of the motives and power
of political leaders on the part of the public has given rise to
the imposition of legal and institutional barriers which serve
to prevent them from achieving the goals which the public
expects them accomplish. In the long run the leadership
vacuum will be filled in one way or another, and strong.
institutionalized leadership is clearly preferable to personalized
charismatic leadership.

In the United States, the strengthening of leadership
institutions requires action with respect to both the Congress
and the president. In Congress, for the past decade the trend
has been toward a greater dispersion of power in both the
House and Senate. Yet if Congress is to play an effective
governing role as distinct from a critical and opposition role,
it has to be able to formulate overall goals, determine
priorities, and initiate programs. Inevitably this requires some
centralization of power within Congress.

The imperial presidency is rapidly disappearing into
history, and there is clearly no need to bring it back. There is
a need, however, to insure that the pendulum does not swing
too far in the other direction. Proposed legislative restrictions
on presidential power should always be judged by the
question: If the president does not exercise this power, who
will? If Congress can exercise the power effectively, there
may be good grounds for restricting the president. But every
restriction of presidential power does not necessarily redound
to the benefit of Congress. It may equally well increase the
power of bureaucratic agencies or private interest groups.

In Japan, the prime minister's leadership has been restricted
by the bureaucratic sectionalism of each ministry.
Budget-making is done totally by the Budget Bureau in the
Ministry of Finance. The prime minister has no staff, and
there is no coordinating agency under his direct command.
The institutional strengthening of the prime minister's leadership
through the transfer of the Budget Bureau to the prime
minister's office or the Cabinet Secretariat, the creation of
positions for high-level aides to the prime minister, and the
reorganization and development of policy research and coordinating
functions in the Cabinet Secretariat and prime
minister's office, including various "Deliberation Councils,"
should be considered seriously.

Under the LDP's single majority rule, the Diet has never
exercised any leadership role. The budget presented by the
government has been approved by the LDP majority without
fail. Almost 100 percent of legislation has been presented by
the government upon prior consultation with the governing
party and been approved by the majority in the Diet. In light,
however, of the possibility of the loss of a majority by the
LDP, the Diet should be prepared to take more initiative in
legislation and budget-making.

The European situation is extremely diverse and does not
call for common or even convergent remedies. The French
presidencyfor the time being is extremely strong, much
stronger than the American. If there is a problem it is to
reintroduce democratic checks. If the problem is difficult, it
is because very little margin has ever existed in the French
tradition between the predominance of the executive, which
means too few checks, and the predominance of Parliament,
which means a rather impotent _régime d'assemblée_. The
Italian government presents almost exactly the other side of
the coin. Its decision-making capacity has almost disintegrated
and the problem is to restore conditions for
developing a stronger, more stable, more active executive
which can at the same time be accepted by the political class.

Even if one does not focus on these extreme examples, one
discovers that each country has its own idiosyncratic
problems to which there is no common solution. Two
common problems nevertheless emerge on which more
general recommendations could be made. First of all, there is
almost everywhere a crisis of parliaments. It is due only
partially to legal or constitutional evolution, since it develops
equally within opposite setups. One could better hypothesize
that the divergent structural evolutions are just different
answers to the same problem. This crisis involves the problem
of representation and the problem of expertise. Modern
parliaments do not have the necessary expertise to maintain
an effective check on the executive and their members
cannot represent citizens adequately in policy-making
debates since they have to rely on earlier, now meaningless
cleavages to be elected.

The second common problem area is that of implementation
and public administration. Everywhere one discovers a
complete dissociation between the decision-making system,
dominated by traditional and often quite rhetorical political
debate, and the implementation system, which is the preserve
of administrative systems quite often centralized and strong,
but usually even more irresponsive when they are centralized
and strong. This dissociation is the main cause of political
alienation amongst citizens. It continually nourishes utopian
dreams and radical postures and reinforces opposition to the
state. The main effort in Europe should be, therefore, to
reinsert democratic debate in administrative procedure, to
prevent the monopoly of expertise by public administration,
and to restore functions to parliament, by giving parliament
new expertise and thus the possibility to debate on an equal
level with the civil servants. Finally, a general reform of
public administration and especially of local implementation
systems should be a central practical concern that could be
answered by European countries in a genuinely comparative
and cooperative way.

3. Reinvigoration of Political Parties

Party loyalties, like loyalties to church, state, and class,
have tended to weaken throughout much of the Trilateral
area. A more highly educated, more affluent, and generally
more sophisticated public is less willing to commit itself
blindly and irrevocably to a particular party and its
candidates. Yet partisan allegiances, along with party
conflicts, have historically been the bedrock of democracy.
Even today political parties remain indispensable to insure
open debate over meaningful choices, to help aggregate
interests, and to develop political leaders. To continue to
perform these functions they will have to adapt themselves to
the changed needs and interests of the electorate. If the
"post-industrial world" is a world in which knowledge is
king, the political parties must increasingly devote themselves
to supplying this commodity, just as in an earlier --- and
poorer --- age they focused on material benefits such as jobs,
patronage, and social insurance.

To fulfill its political functions properly, a political party
must, on the one hand, reflect the interests and needs of
major social forces and interest groups and, on the other
hand, it must also in some measure be independent of
particular interests and capable of aggregating them and
working out broader compromises among them. Changes in
party structure, membership, leadership, and activities should
be oriented towards increasing the ability of parties to
perform these two conflicting but indispensable functions. In
Europe, for instance, parties are still divided between parties
of notables and mass membership parties. Mass parties
emphasizing the defense of group interests and status
positions prevent the aggregation of interests and the learning
of compromise. Not only do they not train citizens for the
difficulties of choice and the understanding of government,
but they condition them to misunderstanding and to
alienation. Nor do traditional parties of notables do a better
job. They may emphasize aggregation much more in their
action but keep themselves as narrow as possible and refuse
to train citizens in real participation.

Nowhere are the horns of the dilemma of interest
representation versus interest aggregation more painfully
visible than in the difficult area of party finance. Historically,
political parties have in large part been dependent on the
dues and subscriptions of individual members and supporters
on the one hand, and on substantial contributions from
business corporations and labor unions on the other. But, in
addition, a number of Trilateral societies (including the four
Scandinavian countries, France, Italy, Germany, and Canada)
now appropriate public monies to cover party expenses
between and during elections. In Germany the government
provides an estimated 35 percent of party funds.

The reinvigoration of political parties, needed for the
effective working of democratic politics, seems to require a
diversification of the sources from which parties raise their
funds. Political parties should not be dependent exclusively
upon either individual members or organized interests or the
state for the resources needed to perform their functions.
They should be able to draw support from all three sources.

The achievement of the appropriate balance among these
sources requires different action in different societies. In the
United States, for instance, recent legislation providing public
monies for presidential candidates represents a step in the
proper direction. So also is the movement during the past
decade to broaden the base of party finance and to solicit
small sums from a large number of contributors. On the other
hand, the laws prohibiting. political contributions by
corporations serve little useful purpose and, as recent
prosecutions make clear, have been regularly evaded. The
desirability of repealing such restrictions should be carefully
considered. The danger that political parties will become
unduly dependent upon and responsive to a few corporate
interests can best be countered by (a) requiring full publicity
for all political contributions and (b) insuring the availability
of public monies as an alternative and balance to funds from
the private sector.

In Japan, the amount of money contributed by business
corporations to the LDP has been disproportionally huge and
has given rise to a sense of unfair competition and the
suspicion of implicit corruption between the governing party
and business. This unfairness might be attacked first of all by
measures prohibiting all contributions by corporations, or at
least setting strict upper limits on them and also requiring full
publicity for the contributions made. The LDP needs to
survive such a trial in order to consolidate the legitimacy of
Japanese democracy itself. Even if such measures are destined
to fail, by evasion and utilization of loopholes, they will still
serve to create fairer competition between parties and
stimulate individual contributions and involvement in party
activities. Most difficult to achieve in Japan is an increase in
individual contributions. Politicians and political parties
should do their utmost to stimulate them. For instance, the
personal sponsoring associations (_koenkai_) of individual
politicians should undertake to finance themselves by
contributions from their members.

4. Restoring a Balance between Government and Media

For well over 200 years in Western societies, a struggle has
been underway to defend the freedom of the press to
investigate, to criticize, to report, and to publish its findings
and opinions against the efforts by government officials to
curb that freedom. Freedom of the press is absolutely
essential to the effective working of democratic government.
Like any freedom, however, it is a freedom which can be
abused. Recent years have seen an immense growth in the
scope and power of the media. In many countries, in
addition, either as a result of editorial direction or as a result
of the increasing influence of the journalists vis-à-vis owners
and editors, the press has taken an increasingly critical role
towards government and public officials. In some countries,
traditional norms of "objectivity" and "impartiality" have
been brushed aside in favor of "advocatory journalism." The
responsibility of the press should now be increased to be
commensurate with its power; significant measures are
required to restore an appropriate balance between the press,
the government, and other institutions in society.

These recent changes in the press-government relationship
are perhaps most clearly marked in the United States. The
increase in media power is not unlike the rise of the industrial
corporations to national power at the end of the nineteenth
century. Just as the corporations enveloped themselves in the
constitutional protection of the due process clause, the media
now defend themselves in terms of the First Amendment.[^8/s1] In
both cases, there obviously are important rights to be
protected, but broader interests of society and government
are also at stake. In due course, beginning with the Interstate
Commerce Act and the Sherman Antitrust Act,[^8/s2] measures
had to be taken to regulate the new industrial centers of
power and to define their relations to the rest of society.
Something comparable appears to be now needed with
respect to the media. Specifically, there is a need to insure to
the press its right to print what it wants without prior
restraint except in most unusual circumstances. But there is
also the need to assure to the government the right and the
ability to withhold information at the source. In addition,
there is no reason for denying to public officials equal
protection of the laws against libel, and the courts should
consider moving promptly to reinstate the law of libel as a
necessary and appropriate check upon the abuses of power
by the press. Journalists should develop their own standards
of professionalism and create mechanisms, such as press
councils, for enforcing those standards on themselves. The
alternative could well be regulation by the government.

[^8/s1]: The First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States
declares that "Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of
speech, or of the press." The due process clause is from the Fourteenth
Amendment --- "nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty,
or property, without due process of law."

The Japanese press, especially the five nationwide
newspapers with several millions circulation each and the
commercial TV networks closely associated with each of
them, have somewhat different traditions and problems from
their counterparts in the United States or in Western Europe.
Nonpartisanship and an opposition attitude towards the
government have been the traditions of the Japanese press.
The results are a policy of equal distance from all political
parties, and a high sensitivity to the mood of the mass public.
The functioning of Japanese democracy would be improved
if the individual newspapers took clearer stands in support of
or opposition to the government.

In Europe, the more traditional and numerous press has
given way to fewer, stronger and less committed oligopolistic
papers. This change, which was viewed at first as a trend
toward depoliticization, in the end increased the political
power of the press as an independent institution, thus
bringing it closer to the American and Japanese situations.
The same dangers therefore seem to appear with the need for
the same kind of difficult but essential counterbalance.

[^8/s2]: The Interstate Commerce Act, passed by Congress in 1887, was
aimed particularly at the major railroad companies. The Sherman
Antitrust Act, passed in 1890, was aimed more generally.

5. Reexamination of the Cost and the Functions of Higher Education

The 1960s saw tremendous expansion in higher
education throughout the Trilateral societies. This expansion
was the product of increasing affluence, a demographic bulge
in the college-age group, and the increasingly widespread
assumption that the types of higher education open formerly
in most societies (with the notable exception of the United
States) only to a small elite group should "by right" be made
available generally. The result of this expansion, however, can
be the overproduction of people with university education in
relation to the jobs available for them, the expenditure of
substantial sums of scarce public monies and the imposition
on the lower classes of taxes to pay for the free public
education of the children of the middle and upper classes.
The expansion of higher education can create frustrations
and psychological hardships among university graduates who
are unable to secure the types of jobs to which they believe
their education entitles them, and it can also create
frustrations and material hardships for nongraduates who are
unable to secure jobs which were previously open to them.

In the United States, some retrenchment in higher
education is already underway as a result of slower growth in
enrollments and new ceilings on resources. What seems
needed, however, is to relate educational planning to
economic and political goals. Should a college education be
provided generally because of its contribution to the overall
cultural level of the populace and its possible relation to the
constructive discharge of the responsibilities of citizenship? If
this question is answered in the affirmative, a program is then
necessary to lower the job expectations of those who receive
a college education. If the question is answered in the
negative, then higher educational institutions should be
induced to redesign their programs so as to be geared to the
patterns of economic development and future job
opportunities.

In Japan, the expansion of higher education in the 1960s
was achieved mainly through low-cost education by private
universities without much money from the government.
Financially, however, the private universities are now
approaching bankruptcy, and low-cost education has created
doubts about the quality of university education. An increase
in public financial support to private universities is now
under way. As for the employment of university graduates, at
least so far, because of rapid expansion of the tertiary service
sector, there has as yet been no problem of overproduction
and unemployment. Major uncertainties, however, exist
concerning the future of Japanese higher education. With the
stagnation of the governmental budget, the increase of public
funds for higher education will face a ceiling, and the choice
as to whether Japan should have "low-quality and
high-quantity" higher education or "high-quality and
limited-quantity" higher education will become serious. In
addition, both employment and mobility of university
graduates depend on the expansion of the tertiary sector,
which is not unlimited. In this respect, also, Japan is now
rapidly approaching the point where some "retrenchment" in
higher education will be necessary.

European higher education, in contrast, needs
consolidation and rejuvenation more than retrenchment.
Here again, it differs widely from country to country in its
structure, modes of operation, and place in society. But
everywhere it is parochial, conservative, and compartmentalized.
With a few exceptions in sectors such as the professional
schools and in countries such as Britain, it is chaotic,
inefficient, operates extremely poorly, and develops opposition
and alienation among the students. One cannot overemphasize
the significance of such a state of affairs. By now
higher education is the most important value-producing
system in society. That it works either poorly or at crosspurposes
with society should be a matter of great concern.
Such opposition may be good and creative up to a point, but
it has become more and more sterile since it is now depriving
society of the necessary stimulus of the younger generation's
creativity.

6. More Active Innovation in the Area of Work

A long tradition exists in the West and in Japan of
governmental involvement in the broad area of labor and
social policies. Such policies may be considered as one of the
greatest achievements of Trilateral democracies. Health,
hazard and security coverage, freedom of association,
bargaining rights, the right to strike, and workers councils all
provide broad protection and broad possibilities for corrective
action.

Two basic new problems have arisen, however, which take
on more and more prominence as older ones recede. They are
the problems of, first, the working structure of the
enterprise, and, second, of the content of the job itself. Both
of these problems call for a new kind of active intervention
which is of great importance for each society's internal
equilibrium and governability. These problems unfortunately
are not amenable to easy legislative fiat or executive
intervention. They require a painful transformation of social
relations, of cultural and authority patterns, and even of
modes of reasoning.

Up to now the dominant social democratic or even liberal
schools of thought have focused on proposals for industrial
democracy modeled on patterns of political democracy. They
have rarely succeeded, and when they did the proposals did
not appear very effective, basically because they were
running against the industrial culture and the constraints of
business organization. This movement has found a new
impetus, especially in Western Europe, with strong popular
pressure for self-management and the rediscovery by the left
of nationalization as a key argument in the political arena.

Many people advocate the more moderate course of
participation by labor in crucial decisions affecting output,
productivity, and working conditions, such as developed in
Germany under the name of codetermination. This would,
they think, provide a strong incentive for unions to act
responsibly. In some circumstances this could indeed be the
result. On the other hand, however, codetermination has
been only partially successful in Germany, and it would raise
impossible problems in many Western democracies, either
because leftist trade unionists would oppose it and utilize it
without becoming any more moderate, or because employers
would manage to defeat its purposes.

A quite different, more promising, and more fundamental
strategy is to focus on the second set of problems, those of
the job, working conditions, and work organization. This is a
much more concrete field where deep resentment and
frustrations have developed, feeding back into the more
conventional aspects of labor-management bargaining. This is
a problem area where basic change is becoming possible. New
thinking and experimentation has occurred, which should be
widely encouraged and subsidized. Industry should be given
all possible incentives to move ahead and implement
gradually new modes of organization. This is the only way
now to alleviate the new tensions that tend to mark
post-industrial society in this area and which otherwise
nourish irresponsible blackmailing tactics and new inflationary
pressures. At the same time this is a necessary step to
restore the status and dignity of manual work and therefore
help solve the more and more acute problem of the immigrant
workers in Western Europe, which might otherwise
become equivalent to the racial problems of the United
States.

7. Creation of New Institutions for the Cooperative Promotion of Democracy

The effective working of democratic government in the
Trilateral societies can now no longer be taken for granted.
The increasing demands and pressures on democratic
government and the crisis in governmental resources and
public authority require more explicit collaboration. One
might consider, therefore, means of securing support and
resources from foundations, business corporations, labor
unions, political parties, civic associations, and, where
possible and appropriate, governmental agencies for the
creation of an institute for the strengthening of democratic
institutions. The purpose of such an institute would be to
stimulate collaborative studies of common problems involved
in the operations of democracy in the Trilateral societies, to
promote cooperation among institutions and groups with
common concerns in this area among the Trilateral regions,
and to encourage the Trilateral societies to learn from each
other's experience how to make democracy function more
effectively in their societies. There is much which each
society can learn from the others. Such mutual learning
experiences are familiar phenomena in the economic and
military fields; they must also be encouraged in the political
field. Such an institute could also serve a useful function in
calling attention to questions of special urgency, as, for
instance, the critical nature of the problems currently
confronting democracy in Europe.

### EXCERPTS OF REMARKS BY RALF DAHRENDORF ON THE GOVERNABILITY STUDY

#### I

Governability presumably refers to the ability of
governments to give direction to the economies, societies,
and political communities in which they govern, and to do so
effectively. Could it not be argued that one of the traditional
characteristics of democracies is that we do not ask
governments to give direction to the economies, societies,
and political communities, at least not to the extent to which
nondemocratic societies are doing this? Might it not be
argued, therefore, that by raising the question of governability
in relation to democracies, one is in fact raising the
question of whether the power of government should be
increased rather than the question of whether the power of
government should be restored? Is it not misleading to imply
that governments in democracies had all those powers in the
past which are now demanded for them? Should we not
perhaps check ourselves every now and then and remember
that one of the things democracy is about is to enable people
and groups to operate in what might be called a market
environment rather than an environment which is largely
determined by directives issuing from government and political
institutions?

#### II

In the "arenas for action"[^8/s3], you find a number of
remarkable statements about the relationship between democracy
and economic growth. "The promotion of economic
growth, taking into careful consideration the effects of such
growth on resource exhaustion and environmental pollution,
consequently must have top priority on the agenda of
democracy. ... Political democracy requires economic
growth; economic growth ... depends upon effective democratic
planning." Important, and, as you will admit, far-reaching
statements. It is clearly desirable, at least that is my view,
that economic growth should continue. Yet there may be a
point in asking a number of questions in relation to these
statements. And there may be a point in discussing them at
some length. Why should it be so that democracy is to some
extent dependent on economic growth? Is there anything in
the concept of democracy that relates it to economic
growth? Is democracy unthinkable without it? Is it actually
true that those countries in which economic growth was least
effective were also the countries in which democratic institutions
were least effective? Could it not be said that it is the
one-party socialist states above all which are in trouble
without economic growth. Is not the link between the assumption
of economic growth and political organization in
fact much closer in the communist countries, and is that not
one of the reasons why they are worried at a time when, for
them, too, economic growth is by no means a certainty?
Does not perhaps Mr. Brezhnev have much more reason to
worry about the future of economic growth than Mr. Ford? I
should have thought that it would be useful to examine these
questions in the study, although I am not at all sure that I
would be able to give a proper answer to them. If I were to
try to give an answer, I would like to add another question
which I believe is and should be of major concern for
anybody who is thinking about the future of industrial
societies under liberal conditions. Is growth presumably
growth of a gross national product? Is this the only kind of
expansion of human life chances which we can think of in
free societies? Are there not perhaps other forms of growth
and improvement of human lives? Is it really necessary to
assume that we have to continue along the lines which have
been characteristic for the last twenty-five years in order to
maintain democratic institutions? The important and prima
facie plausible statements about democracy and economic
growth would warrant and perhaps require a rather more
elaborate reasoning.

[^8/s3]: See Part A of this appendix.

#### III

My next point relates to governability more or less
directly. The paper for discussion here is in my view an
important and in many ways convincing analysis of a difficult
and changing political, social, and economic situation. I
would like to underline an aspect of the problem which I
believe is of overriding importance.

I start with three simple things --- simple to put in words but
much less simple to cope with in fact. First, there is a
growing desire for more immediate participation on the part
of many citizens in the developed countries, which confronts
national governments with unfamiliar but extremely serious
problems and makes it more difficult for them to give
direction to developments in their countries. This is, of
course, what Mr. Huntington in his chapter calls the
democratic challenge to authority. It is a development which
may be regarded as natural consequence of the
development of citizenship over the last century or two. This
development of citizenship has led more and more people in
local communities and industrial enterprises and other
institutions to express a desire to be a part of the machinery
of decision-making to a much greater extent than may have
been the case in the past. And governments have in fact
found it difficult to make decisions, even apparently simple
decisions such as those about the sites of nuclear power
stations. Participation is not merely the taking of
responsibility but is very often an attempt to check
government action or object to it.

The second aspect is that for many important problems
the national political space has become evidently and largely
insufficient, although at the same time we do not have
satisfactory institutions, let alone democratic ones, to cope
with new problems as they arise in new, international
political spaces.

The third aspect is new for governments. Democratic
governments find it difficult to cope with the power of
extraparliamentary institutions which determine by their
decisions the life chances of as many (or in some cases more)
people as the decisions of governments can possibly
determine in many of our countries. · Indeed, these
extraparliamentary institutions often make governmental
power look ridiculous. When I talk about extraparliamentary
institutions, I am essentially thinking of two powerful
economic institutions --- giant companies and large and
powerful trade unions.

All three of these developments have common
denominator. The greater demand for participation, the
removal of effective political spaces from the national to the
international level, and the removal of the power to
determine people's life chances from political institutions to
other institutions are all signs of what might be called the
dissolution, perhaps the dilution of the general political
public which we assumed was the real basis of democratic
institutions in the past. Instead of there being an effective
political public in democratic countries from which
representative institutions emerge and to which representatives
are answerable, there is a fragmented public, in part a
nonexistent public. There is a rather chaotic picture in the
political communities of many democratic countries. A public
of citizens who cast their votes from individual interests
and thereby influence the choice of representatives who in
turn feel their responsibility to an identified public has to
some considerable extent disappeared. To that extent, representative
government has become very different indeed from
the sort of creature that was described in _The Federalist_
papers, or by John Stuart Mill, or by many others before and
after.

I would argue that the main thing to think about is what
we can do to reestablish an effective general political public
under the changed conditions in which we are living today.
One would have to discuss the ways in which the legitimate
demand for immediate individual participation can be linked
to national and international decisions. One would have to
discuss what in this Commission has been called the
renovation of the international system, not only in terms of
the effectiveness of new international institutions but also in
terms of their democratic quality. This would raise familiar
and yet new problems of the relation between representation
and expertise, between democratic election and knowledge of
those standing for election.

I am quite certain that a number of things must _not_
happen if we want to reestablish an effective political public
(or perhaps establish an effective political public for a very
large number of citizens for the first time in the history of
democratic countries). I for one believe that one of the things
that must not happen under any condition is a deliberate
policy of educational retrenchment --- a policy in which
educational institutions are once again linked to economic
output and economic performance rather than to the need to
give every individual a chance to take part in the political
process. I also believe that one of the things that must not
happen is that we establish any greater dependence of the
media on governments. On the contrary, I believe that the
media in most of our democratic societies are in need of
protection. They are endangered by a number of processes,
some of them economic. At the same time I believe they are
some of the main media of expression for what is left of a
general political public, and we should keep them that way.

My main point here is that as we think about a political
public in our day, we cannot simply think of a political
public of individual citizens exercising their common sense
interests on the marketplace, as it were. In rethinking the
notion of the political public, we have to accept the fact that
most human beings today are both individual citizens and
members of large organizations. We have to accept the fact
that most individuals see their interests cared for not only by
an immediate expression of their citizenship rights (or even
by political parties which organize groups of interests) but
also by organizations which at this moment act outside the
immediate political framework and which will continue to
act whether governments like it or not. And I believe,
therefore, somewhat reluctantly, that in thinking about the
political public of tomorrow we shall have to think of a
public in which representative parliamentary institutions are
somehow linked with institutions which in themselves are
neither representative nor parliamentary. I think it is useful
to discuss the exact meaning of something like an effective
social contract, or perhaps a "Concerted Action," or "Conseil
Economique et Social" for the political insitutions of
advanced democracies. I do not believe that free collective
bargaining is an indispensable element of a free and
democratic society. I do believe, however, that we have to
recognize that people are organized in trade unions, that
there are large enterprises, that economic interests have to be
discussed somewhere, and that there has got to be a
negotiation about some of the guidelines by which our
economies are functioning. This discussion should be related
to representative institutions. There may be a need for
reconsidering some of our institutions in this light, not to
convert our countries into corporate states, certainly not, but
to convert them into countries which in a democratic fashion
recognize some of the new developments which have made
the effective political public so much less effective in recent
years.

#### IV

I am not, contrary to many others today, pessimistic about
the future of democracy. Indeed, it seems to me that a
number of recent social developments are likely to make life
much more difficult for the dictatorships of this world. Like
many of you, however, I notice with dismay that it seems to
be difficult, perhaps even impossible, to liberalize
dictatorship within a short period of time and convert it into
a free and democratic country. There is a sad dialectic of
dictatorships in which any attempt to liberalize them rapidly
seems to lead to another kind of authoritarianism.

I do think that in order for democracies to cope with the
new types of problems with which they are faced, they have
to avoid a number of mistakes. They must avoid the belief
that the very progress which they made possible for a large
number of citizens must now be undone because it feels
uncomfortable for some. They have to avoid the belief that a
little more unemployment, a little less education, a little
more deliberate discipline, and a little less freedom of
expression would make the world a better place, in which it
is possible to govern effectively. Indeed, I think, this attempt
to turn back the wheels of history to try to recreate the state
which we have fortunately and deliberately left is in many
ways as uncivilized, indeed primitive, as the belief that all we
need is nationalized ownership, public planning, and worker
control. Either of these mistakes must be avoided if we hope
to manage to create democratic conditions and maintain
them, conditions which offer the largest number the largest
chance for their lives.

In my view, what we have to do above all is to maintain
that flexibility of democratic institutions which is in some
ways their greatest virtue: the ability of democratic
institutions to implement and effect change without
revolution --- the ability to rethink assumptions --- the ability to
react to new problems in new ways --- the ability to develop
institutions rather than change them all the time --- the ability
to keep the lines of communication open between the leaders
and the led --- the ability to make individuals count above all.

We talk about the Trilateral societies, and certainly they
have a lot in common, but there are many differences
between them also, and some have so far managed better
than others to cope with the problems which I have
indicated. I have to confess that at this time, at this time in
particular, I belong to those who believe that it is the North
American societies above all which have managed to maintain
the kind of flexibility which holds out hope for democracy
everywhere.

### DISCUSSION OF STUDY

Discussion of the governability study in Kyoto opened
with the above-printed comments of Ralf Dahrendorf, now
Director of the London School of Economics. These comments
were followed by remarks from each of the three
authors. Michel Crozier reviewed the thrust of his chapter on
Western Europe, including the judgment that democratic
political systems in Europe are now the most vulnerable of
those in the Trilateral regions. The West European democracies
have to carry through "a basic mutation in their model
of government and their mode of social control while facing
at the same time a crisis from within and a crisis from
without." Samuel P. Huntington responded to some of
Dahrendorf's comments. Dahrendorf had raised the issue of
somehow linking to parliamentary institutions such major
extraparliamentary institutions as large labor unions and
business organizations. Huntington expressed surprise that
there was no mention in this analysis of political parties as
aggregators of the interests of extraparliamentary organizations.
On the matter of democracy and economic growth,
Huntington noted that the rather steady growth of the last
twenty-five years has created expectations of continuing
growth, a growth which cannot now be assumed. This is
likely to create problems. As for the effects of international
developments, Huntington stressed that détente has had
negative implications for the cohesion of Trilateral societies.
He argued that the growing importance and visibility on the
foreign policy agenda of international economic issues and
interdependence has involved problems for democratic governments,
sensitive to domestic interests. Reaching for an
overall formulation of the governability question, Huntington
asked if there are inherently destabilizing forces at work in
democratic political systems or whether self-stabilizing, "gyroscope"
effects predominate. One could elaborate an "optimistic
scenario" based on the flexibility and openness of
democratic systems, but one could also elaborate a "pessimistic
scenario" of self-destructive tendencies and a mounting
accumulation of demands. We need to take advantage of
the self-correcting opportunities that do exist. In his introductory
remarks, Joji Watanuki noted that rapid growth in
Japan has brought automatic large increases in government
revenues. This has greatly helped the government meet rising
demands. If there is a revenue shrinkage, a "higher degree of
governability" would be required to see the society through
the necessary adaptations.

In the discussion which followed the introductory remarks
of Dahrendorf and the three authors, the United States
chapter aroused particularly lively discussion. The Founding
Fathers of the United States, one North American
Commissioner stated, did not see their first problem as that
of creating a _governable_ democracy. At least as important in
their minds was the guaranteeing of the rights of citizens
against the possible excesses of their governors. This Commissioner
is particularly impressed after the Watergate episode
with the wisdom of an emphasis on the protection of rights.
The study should emphasize the vitality of American democratic
institutions, particularly the press, the Congress, and
the courts. The authors, he stated, need to balance their
focus on governability with an equal concern for protection
of the rights of citizens. Another Commissioner concurred,
suggesting it might be more appropriate to examine the
"excesses" of the "governors" than those of the governed.
Another participant traced problems in the United States
more to the failure of leadership than a "democratic surge."
He argued that the decline of political parties is related to the
growth of government bureaucracies, which are to some
extent substituting for parties. More attention should be
given to the problems of big bureaucracy for democracy. This
Commissioner stated that it is "simply not true" that the press
is automatically in opposition to the government in the
United States. Congress is not always in opposition either,
even though in the last eight years Congress has been under
control of the other party, with no obligation to back the
President. Some of the remedies outlined in the "arenas for
action," this member concluded, would be "wrong, selfdefeating,
deadly." According to another North American
Commissioner, who disagreed that the need is for "less
democracy," the current relative deadlock in U.S. politics is
not unique. Contrary to the pessimists, he feels recent
developments indicate "triumph" and a "finest hour" for
American democracy. The disenchantment of the American
public comes from the poor performance of the government,
lurching from crisis to crisis. The country needs more
appropriate planning, carried on in such a way that the
people are involved in helping to set goals. This is a preferred
alternative. to some kind of technocratic elite model for
progress. A number of other Commissioners also associated
themselves in general with the above points, arguing for
"more democracy, not less" and expressing particular concern
for maintenance of "absolutely free new media." One
participant saw the Constitution and system of law in the
United States as the principal "self-correcting" mechanism
there.

A Canadian Commissioner argued the unhealthiness for
Canada of a recommendation for reinvigoration of political
parties. Parties are ways to control members, he stated. They
alienate more capable young politicians and favor
conformists. Issues are considered less on their merits than
they should be. In Canada, this Commissioner stressed, we
need institutions to "blue" and "mute" parties. Parliamentary
committees are important here and should be strengthened.
The reinvigoration we should seek is of parliamentary
institutions, with decision-making done publicly to the greatest
extent possible. This Commissioner was also troubled by
the recommendations on the media in the "arenas for
action." The press needs strengthening and protection. In
Canada, it has been more effective in opposing the government
than the Opposition party. The Opposition gathers
information from the press and uses the press to make its
views known. These are very valuable functions.

Later in the discussion, Huntington responded to critics of
the chapter on the United States. As for the views of the
Founding Fathers, Huntington quoted from a well-known
contribution of James Madison to _The Federalist_. Madison
states that the "first" problem is to "enable the government
to control the governed," and then to "oblige it to control
itself." Comments in the discussion had suggested,
Huntington stated, that this "balance" is now tilted toward
government and not the citizens; but never before in
American history, he argued, have citizens and citizen
organizations been more assertive and effective. Huntington
put much emphasis on the "balance" idea, and argued there
had been a shift against government authority which should
not be allowed to go too far. On the media, he stressed that
their power has undeniably increased, and that this must be
taken into account in our analysis. The comments made on
the press in Canada, he added, also applied in the United
States and indicate the power of the media. In conclusion,
Huntington asked the two questions he thought most essential.
First, where is the proper place to draw the balance?
Second, what is the state of the balance in the United States
now? Huntington sees overwhelming evidence that the balance
has shifted away from government.

A European Commissioner underlined the weakness of
constitutional systems in some European countries, particularly
those whose electoral systems encourage a multiplicity
of parties without this being counter-balanced by a strong
executive. He mentioned Denmark, Holland, and Belgium.
These countries might usefully learn from or perhaps adapt
constitutional features of other states like France, Western
Germany or Britain, particularly for restoring executive
power and gaining "a new lease on life" for their democratic
systems without loss of liberties. This Commissioner realized
that systems for constitutional amendment were very difficult
in the countries requiring change, but the effort should
be made. In closing, he expressed "anguish" and "despair"
that European unification has not made more progress,
progress essential for democracy's future in Europe. Another
European Commissioner recalled Dahrendorf's comments
about the insufficiency of national political space. Among
the Trilateral regions, this is more true in Europe and Japan
than in North America, he stated. In Europe in particular the
adequacy of national political space is very much in question.

Another European Commissioner noted that in most
Western European countries there is not a chance that
communist parties will come to power. France and Italy are
important exceptions. Change there would "create waves." It
would erode the Community and Atlantic Alliance. On
Britain, this Commissioner emphasized its remarkable
democratic resilience and political resources. Another
Commissioner concurred, terming comments about the
"ungovernability" of Britain "completely nonsense." He
noted that Britain had been an industrial society much longer
than other states and was thus far ahead of the others in the
problems it now faces.

The future of the Communist party in Italy was raised by
another European Commissioner later in the discussion. This
was already the largest Communist party in Europe in the
years just after the war. Its election advances since then have
actually been quite limited, this Commissioner stated. When
the Communist party moves toward power in Italy, there is
an "allergic reaction" from the others which keeps the party
out of power. This Commissioner noted the municipal and
regional elections coming up in Italy on June 15. He thought
the events in Portugal would help the democratic parties.
Further European integration would also help keep the
Communist party in check.

One Commissioner noted that he found Dahrendorf's
comments "heartening," though they presented him with the
"eternal liberal dilemma" --- protection of rights is not possible
without effective government. He noted the success of
"codetermination" in Germany as an effective way to
stabilize a system under stress. Another Commissioner added
two points related to governability concerns. For one,
democratic governments are run by politicians who make
decisions for political reasons. This is a fact of life. Second,
governments have assumed they could do the politically
attractive thing for the majority and the minority would pay.
Another European Commissioner cautioned that there be
"clear-cut responsiblity" in any arrangements that would link
powerful extraparliamentary institutions to parliaments, an
issue raised by Dahrendorf.

The chapter on Japan is the most optimistic of the regional
chapters, one North American Commissioner noted. Japan
has not lost the ability to achieve a consensus and act on it,
he stated. This may be attributable to a real difference in
values, including greater identification with the group. The
drive for individual satisfaction must be balanced with such
concern for the group.

One Japanese Commissioner related the cohesive strength
of the Japanese political system to the high quality of
middle-level leadership in the country, those in contact with
the people. This appears to be somewhat in decline, however.
With the growth of the mass media, people have less need for
these middle-level leaders in interpreting events and making
their views known. This also hurts the organization of
political parties. As the middle level has less political
responsibility, its quality will decline.

This Commissioner sees some of the recent social problems
of the Trilateral regions related to a temporary shift in the
population structure, with an extraordinarily large number of
younger people, with different values. As this bulge in the
population structure moves on, problems will become less
severe.

Another Japanese Commissioner recalled a statement of
Lenin's that a revolution cannot be initiated by demands
from below, but only when the governing classes are divided
and dissatisfied. One might argue that governing classes are
now in this condition. This Commissioner pointed to three
weaknesses of democracy. For one, human beings are weak.
In a monopoly position they will wield excessive power. He
mentioned the press in Japan, whose decisions are sometimes
more important than the government's, and also associations
like the medical association, which is in a monopoly position,
with the tax system rigged in its favor. The Diet is not doing
much about these powerful organizations. Second, Japanese
intellectuals and students are being attracted by radicalism. If
these fill the middle level of leadership later, Japan may be
turning a corner toward a worse situation. Third, it seems
that opportunists are the ones who gain and hold political
power. Tolerant individuals generally do not.

Another Japanese Commissioner emphasized that
democracy in Japan is working rather well. He noted that at
all levels there are about 80,000 elected political leaders
throughout the country. Certainly there are some
governability problems. This Commissioner mentioned the
controversy over the Japanese nuclear ship which drifted in
the Pacific for some fifty days in August and September of
1974, having been refused port facilities by local communities.
He mentioned the railway unions, which must be
confronted. He noted the current dispute about the Constitution
centering on Minister Inaba, which held up Diet deliberations
on other matters for a week. He mentioned uncertainties
about the U.S. commitment in Korea after recent events
in Indochina, and uncertainty about whether the Japan
Communist party could be excluded from a coalition formed
when the LDP majority disappears. These matters add elements
of pessimism.

Another Japanese Commissioner also related international
issues to governability concerns. The world is searching for a
new system, he stated, and needs strong leadership in various
countries. Governability, however, is in decline. Even in
Japan, the government does not have much room to
maneuver. In the long term this Commissioner was optimistic
about Japanese democracy, but can we wait for its problems
to be solved? On the U.S. --- Japanese relationship after the
Indochina war, Japan is not apprehensive about the
administration, but rather about Congress. Is the President in
control? Is there a trend in the United States toward
isolationism?

Looking over the whole discussion, one North American
Commissioner related it to discussion the previous day of
resources and global redistribution of power. He put it all in
the framework of "the central issue for the industrial
democracies," namely the "apparent conflict between equity
and effectiveness." With regard to developing countries, the
main issue is that of equity, but "one can have no more
equity than one can afford." And the wealth of the
developed world, he argued, should not be too narrowly
construed. It is "not especially physical resources but rather
the complex of spiritual, governmental, and political
(capabilities), the way in which (the people) manage to
attack and solve their problems." We see this most clearly in
the case of Japan, this Commissioner argued, which is
relatively "resource-less" in a physical sense. What could one
take away from Japan? What is its wealth? What is it except a
complex of going institutions?

Another participant returned to the issue raised by
Dahrendorf of somehow associating nonparliamentary groups
with the parliamentary process. It was suggested this might
be seen in relation to international institutions, not just
national political systems. This participant sees underway a
"partial domestication of international society," with many
domestic problems of the nineteenth century finding their
analogs in international problems of the twentieth century.
"Partly civilianized international relations" must not become
so turbulent that we lose societal openness and freedom
while trying to achieve the equity that is necessary. The
Trilateral region, he argued, is a "vital core" in this effort.

A number of Commissioners emphasized the importance
of the issues being raised in the study and discussion and
hoped the Commission would continue work in this general
area. One Commissioner expressed his support "very
concretely" for the proposed institute for the strengthening
of democratic institutions.

## APPENDIX II: CANADIAN PERSPECTIVES ON THE GOVERNABILITY OF DEMOCRACIES --- _Discussion in Montreal, May 16, 1975_

The rapporteurs of the Trilateral Commission Task Force
on the Governability of Democracies identified common
"governability" problems in the three regions. These have
been viewed as stemming from such factors as the "changing
democratic context," the rise of "anomic democracy," various
democratic "dysfunctions," the "delegitimization" of
authority, "system overload," the "disaggregation" of interests,
and an increasing parochialism in international affairs.

Detailed background papers underlined the problems peculiar
to Europe, Japan, and the United States in the area of
governability. To explore the Canadian scene, a colloquium
sponsored by the Canadian Group of the Trilateral Commission
brought together in May 1975 approximately thirty
Canadians involved in both the analysis and the practice of
government. Several of the Commission's Task Force members
were on hand.

The participants identified particular Canadian
perspectives on governability and, in dialogue with the Trilateral
Task Force members, drew out significant comparisons
and contrasts in the experiences of Canada, the United
States, and to some extent the other Trilateral regions.

Discussion was conducted around four major issue-areas:
the problem of governability; social, economic and cultural
causes; components of stability; and domestic and foreign
implications. Several major themes emerged from the discussion,
treated in the following short report on the proceedings.

#### _A. The Canadian Governability "Challenge"_

Despite the numerous problems and strains that were
identified with regard to Canadian institutions and values, a
general consensus emerged that Canada's governability problems
were not insoluble and that, indeed, "governability"
itself may be less of a problem than the "reality of participation,"
the "accountability of governors," or as one participant
put it, "the democratizability of governments."

Some felt that accountability was the real issue, both in
the context of governmental decison-making and from the
point of view of expanding participation in decision-making
by such groups as organized labour.

While Canada shares with the United States some major
governability "challenges" (rather than necessarily
"problems"), that is, an overload of demands on the political
system, a decline in traditional attitudes to authority,
changing social values, increasing "dehumanization" of society,
and labour/management conflicts, to name a few, these
challenges do not appear to have attained the serious
proportions they are said to have reached in the United
States. A few of the differentiating factors mentioned were
the racial problem in the United States, more extensive urban
problems, and domestic disillusionment engendered by the
decline of the leadership role of the United States in world
affairs. Such phenomena as Vietnam and Watergate could be
seen as special focal points of long-term trends.

There remained a rather clear division of opinion among
the participants as to whether or not there was evidence of
"ungovernability" or a trend toward it in Canada.

#### _B. System Overload_

It was argued by some that the growing tendencies of
students and workers to challenge authority and the new
vigour of union demands may even be seen as healthy
democratic phenomena and may be heralding the end of a
period of "pseudo-democracy," providing the first real
attempt at genuine and comprehensive democracy. However,
some of those who tended to regard Canadian democracy as
becoming increasingly ungovernable viewed these trends as
increasing the overload of demands on decision-making
institutions, thereby decreasing their capacity to sort out
priorities, and as a part of the general decline of a coherent
"public philosophy." One of the roots of disturbing trends
on the labour front in Canada was identified as the fact that
unions have generally not been brought in a real way into the
decision-making process and are often treated implicitly as
"outlaws." Such an attitude can only influence relations
between organized labour and the broader society in a
negative way.

Another speaker asserted that "system overload" in
Canada is a "fantasy," that the functioning of the system had
not changed and the structure was basically intact, for better
or for worse. Others expressed sympathy for the conditions
in which contemporary politicians operate and claimed that
there was strong evidence for the case that too much was
asked of them. A major criticism of the operation of
democratic governments was their inability to sort out
priorities in the face of increasing demands and their
consequent resort to incrementalism (extension of existing
programs) rather than creative policy-making.

One or two participants suggested that the whole discussion
of governability distorted the real problems and was of
concern only to an elite uneasy about its declining position in
society! They maintained that factors such as rising inflation
and the growth of public expenditure as a percentage of GNP
(which were seen by some as causes or effects of
governability problems) had nothing to do with governability
and may, in fact, have produced more "positive" benefits by
forcing better income distribution, via the "catch up" of
wages and social welfare benefits.

#### _C. Institutions_

Canadian institutions (federalism, the parliamentary
system, the public service, the media) were identified as
distinctive and received particular attention by the
participants. Were they a protection against or a cause of
greater governability problems?

It was pointed out that the expansion and proliferation of
bureaucracy at the federal, provincial, and municipal levels
has contributed to the strains on the Canadian political
system because of diminishing clarity of direction and
accountability. There is a growing tendency, it was said, for
the bureaucracy to take over roles which were traditionally
the essential domain of the politicians --- such as defining the
"public good." This could be regarded as a dangerous
development, particularly in light of the tendency of the
federal bureaucracy to become "Ottawa-centered" and not
properly representative of the regions of Canada.

There was a general consensus that more emphasis should
be placed on the democratically-derived institutions. It was
recommended that the House of Commons be enlarged to
provide better constituency representation and that its procedures
be modernized to facilitate the handling of public
business. The so-called "decline of Parliament" was seen as
due, in part, to the growing importance of federal-provincial
relations in the face of the increasing power of the provinces.
Effective opposition comes from the provinces rather than
the federal opposition parties, possibly attributable to the
situation of one-party dominance in Ottawa.

American participants concluded from the discussion that
the Canadian brand of federalism --- in its maintenance of
a relative greater degree of decentralization --- was a "highly
desirable situation." Despite equally impenetrable provincial
bureaucracies and the bargaining problems engendered by the
equality ascribed to federal and provincial governments, it
was convincingly argued by Canadians that governability
problems were reduced by the flexibility built into the
Canadian style of federal structure and parliamentary system.

It was noted that in Canada, as in the United States, a
certain trend toward fragmentation and regionalization of
political parties could be observed, but there was no indication
that there is anything in Canada approaching what had
been called by American analysts "the decline of the party
system" in the United States. It was held, however, by some
participant noted that the governing Liberal caucus, dominated
by "ministerialists," is consequently not sufficiently conrepresentation
in all major areas of the country. This tendency
toward decentralization was seen by others not only as
inevitable but as desirable, as parties would presumably
become more constituencyand region-oriented which would
offset bureaucratization among elected representatives. One
participant noted that the governing Liberal caucus, dominated
by "ministerialists," is consequently not sufficiently constituency-oriented.
Another suggested that existing Canadian
political parties fulfilled an important role by effecting
trade-offs in nonideological terms.

#### _D. Rhetoric/Performance Gap_

Another major theme emerging from the discussion was
the problem of the gap between rhetoric and performance in
government. Two views, whose consequences are perhaps
equally damaging if true, emerged on this issue: (1) that
people tend to ignore or disbelieve the rhetoric and
consequently lose their faith in the system and refuse to
participate (identified as an "apathy of despair"); and (2)
that, as a result of government rhetoric, expectations are
raised to a point of no possible return or satisfaction,
especially in regard to the allocation of benefits among
individuals and groups.

#### _E. Decline of a "Public Philosophy'_

Labour groups are not impeded, it was said, from making
outrageous demands due to the absence of a strong public
philosophy and to prevalent doubt as to whether fairness
underlies the general allocation of influence and resources.
The decline in "community" and a dehumanization of society
result in the aggressive self-assertion of the individual or
groups. In the absence of a national ethos, governments are
hamstrung in their efforts to cope with such prevalent difficulties
as inflation and labour/management disputes. This
phenomenon of declining cohesive values appears to be common
to both Canada and the United States.

#### _F. Communications and Governability_

Finally, the theme of communications was identified as
both a cause and a result of the problems of governability. It
was noted, even by journalists, that the press tends to provide
short-term, personalized, sensationalist pictures of political
events, thereby widening the rhetoric/performance gap. It
was suggested that a strengthened periodical press is needed
to give more long-term perspective on events, trends, and
institutions.

Poverty of communication both within governments and
between governments and other sectors was also identified as
a governability problem. This was seen as resulting in a
serious lack of knowledge as to how "the other side" takes
decisions, which tends to hamper desirable constructive
bargaining within the industry-government-labour triangle. It
was also suggested that parliament's capacity to achieve a
mediating function has decreased due to partisan factionalism
and its diminishing power over the bureaucracy.

#### _G. Possible Conclusions_

As identified by this colloquium, Canada's foremost.
governability problems can be regarded as falling within four
major areas: the questionable ability of the evolving political
institutions to aggregate-an increasing volume of demands
efficiently and at the same time to retain their accountability
to the public; the increasing rhetoric/performance gap; the
decline of a "public philosophy"; and the problem of
communications. Several characteristics of the Canadian system
were found actually to enhance Canada's governability,
that is, its parliamentary and federal structures of government,
a reasonable degree of decentralization of authority
and the absence of class-based political parties. However, a
general consensus emerged that Canada's governability problems
(as redefined) while not insoluble are real and deserve
urgent attention and remedial action.
