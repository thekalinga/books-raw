# INTRODUCTION

## THE CURRENT PESSIMISM ABOUT DEMOCRACY

For almost a quarter-century the Trilateral countries have
shared a tripartite interest in military security, economic
development, and political democracy. They have
coordinated their efforts to provide for their common
defense. They have cooperated together in the tasks of
economic reconstruction, industrial development, and the
promotion of trade, investment, and welfare within a
framework of common international economic institutions.
They have brought the comforts --- and the anxieties --- of
middle-class status to a growing majority of their peoples. In
somewhat parallel fashion, they have, also, each in its own
way, developed and consolidated their own particular forms
of political democracy, involving universal suffrage, regular
elections, party competition, freedom of speech and
assembly. After twenty-five years, it is not surprising that
earlier assumptions and policies relating to military security
need to be reviewed and altered in the light of the changed
circumstances. Nor is it surprising that the policies and
institutions of the postwar economic system based on the
preeminence of the dollar are in need of a drastic overhaul.
Governments, after all, have traditionally existed to deal with
problems of security and economics, and, individually and
collectively, to adapt their policies in these areas to changing
environments.

What is much more disturbing, because it is more
surprising, is the extent to which it appears that the process
of reconsideration must extend not only to these familiar
arenas of governmental policy but also to the basic
institutional framework through which governments govern.
What are in doubt today are not just the economic and
military policies but also the political institutions inherited
from the past. Is political democracy, as it exists today, a
viable form of government for the industrialized countries of
Europe, North America, and Asia? Can these countries
continue to function during the final quarter of the twentieth
century with the forms of political democracy which they
evolved during the third quarter of that century?

In recent years, acute observers on all three continents
have seen a bleak future for democratic government. Before
leaving office, Willy Brandt was reported to believe that
"Western Europe has only 20 or 30 more years of democracy
left in it; after that it will slide, engineless and rudderless,
under the surrounding sea of dictatorship, and whether the
dictation comes from a politburo or a junta will not make
that much difference." If Britain continues to be unable to
resolve the seemingly unresolvable problems of
inflation-cum-prospective depression, observed one senior
British official, "parliamentary democracy would ultimately
be replaced by a dictatorship." "Japanese democracy will
collapse," warned Takeo Miki in his first days in office,
unless major reforms can be carried out and "the people's
confidence in politics" be restored.[^1/1] The image which recurs
in these and other statements is one of the disintegration of
civil order, the breakdown of social discipline, the debility of
leaders, and the alienation of citizens.. Even what have been
thought to be the most civic of industrialized societies have
been held to be prey to these disabilities, as observers speak
of the Vietnamization of America and the Italianization of
Britain.

This pessimism about the future of democracy has
coincided with a parallel pessimism about the future of
economic conditions. Economists have rediscovered the
fifty-year Kondratieff cycle, according to which 1971 (like 1921)
should have marked the beginning of a sustained
economic downturn from which the industrialized capitalist
world would not emerge until close to the end of the
century. The implication is that just as the political
developments of the 1920s and 1930s furnished the
ironic --- and tragic --- aftermath to a war fought to make the
world safe for democracy, so also the 1970s and 1980s might
furnish a similarly ironic political aftermath to twenty years
of sustained economic development designed in part to make
the world prosperous enough for democracy.

Social thought in Western Europe and North America
tends to go through Pollyanna and Cassandra phases. The
prevalence of pessimism today does not mean that this
pessimism necessarily is well founded. That such pessimism
has not been well founded in the past also does not mean that
it is necessarily ill founded at present. A principal purpose of
this report is to identify and to analyze the challenges
confronting democratic government in today's world, to
ascertain the bases for optimism or pessimism about the
future of democracy, and to suggest whatever innovations
may seem appropriate to make democracy more viable in the
future.

## THE CHALLENGES CONFRONTING DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT

The current pessimism seems to stem from the conjunction
of three types of challenges to democratic government.

First, _contextual challenges_ arise autonomously from the
external environments in which democracies operate and are
not directly a product of the functioning of democratic
government itself. The Czechoslovak government, for instance;
is less democratic today than it might otherwise be
not because of anything over which it had any control. A
severe reversal in foreign relations, such as either a military
disaster or diplomatic humiliation, is likely to pose a
challenge to regime stability. Defeat in war is usually fatal to
any system of government, including a democratic one.
(Conversely, the number of regimes in complex societies
which have been overthrown in circumstances not involving
foreign defeat is extremely small: all regimes, including
democratic ones, benefit from a Law of Political Inertia
which tends to keep them functioning until some external
force interposes itself.) So, also, worldwide depression or
inflation may be caused by factors which are external to any
particular society and which are not caused directly by the
operation of democratic government; and yet they may
present serious problems to the functioning of democracy.
The nature and seriousness of the contextual challenges may
vary significantly from one country to another, reflecting
differences in size, history, location, culture, and level of
development. In combination, these factors may produce few
contextual challenges to democracy, as was generally the
case, for instance, in nineteenth-century America, or they
may create an environment which makes the operation of
democracy extremely difficult, as for instance in Weimar
Germany.

Changes in the international distribution of economic,
political, and military power and in the relations both among
the Trilateral societies and between them and the Second and
Third Worlds now confront the democratic societies with a
set of interrelated contextual challenges which did not exist
in the same way a decade ago. The problems of inflation,
commodity shortages, international monetary stability, the
management of economic interdependence, and collective
military security affect all the Trilateral societies. They
constitute the critical policy issues on the agenda for
collective action.[^1/2] At the same time, however, particular
issues pose special problems for particular countries. With the
most active foreign policy of any democratic country, the
United States is far more vulnerable to defeats in that area
than other democratic governments, which, attempting less,
also risk less. Given the relative decline in its military,
economic, and political influence, the United States is more
likely to face serious military or diplomatic reversal during
the coming years than at any previous time in its history. If
this does occur, it could pose a traumatic shock to American
democracy. The United States is, on the other hand,
reasonably well equipped to deal with many economic
problems which would constitute serious threats to a
resource-short and trade-dependent country like Japan.

These contextual challenges would pose major issues of
policy and institutional innovation in the best of
circumstances. They arise, however, at a time when
democratic governments are also confronted with other
serious problems stemming from the social evolution and
political dynamics of their own societies. The viability of
democracy in a country clearly is related to the _social
structure and social trends_ in that country. A social structure
in which wealth and learning were concentrated in the hands
of a very few would not be conducive to democracy; nor
would a society deeply divided between two polarized ethnic
or regional groups. In the history of the West,
industrialization and democratization moved ahead in
somewhat parallel courses, although in Germany,
democratization lagged behind industrialization. Outside the
West, in Japan, the lag was also considerable. In general,
however, the development of cities and the emergence of the
bourgeoisie diversified the sources of power, led to the
assertion of personal and property rights against the state,
and helped to make government more representative of the
principal groups in society. The power of traditional
aristocratic groups hostile to democracy tended to decline.
Subsequently, democratic trends were challenged, in some
çașes successfully, by the rise of fascist movements appealing
to the economic insecurities and nationalistic impulses of
lower-middle-class groups, supported by the remaining
traditional authoritarian structure. Japan also suffered from
a reactionary military establishment, against which the
bourgeoisie found itself too weak to struggle and to
be able to coexist. In addition, in many countries, communist
parties developed substantial strength among the
working class, advocating the overthrow of "bourgeois
democracy" in the name of revolutionary socialism. The
political and organizational legacy of this phase still exists in
France and Italy, although it is by no means as clear as it
once was that communist participation in the government of
either country would necessarily be the prelude to the death
of democracy there. Thus, at one time or another, threats to
the viability of democratic government have come from the
aristocracy, the military, the middle classes, and the working
class. Presumably, as social evolution occurs, additional
threats may well arise from other points in the social
structure.

At the present time, a significant challenge comes from the
intellectuals and related groups who assert their disgust with
the corruption, materialism, and inefficiency of democracy
and with the subservience of democratic government to
"monopoly capitalism." The development of an "adversary
culture" among intellectuals has affected students, scholars,
and the media. Intellectuals are, as Schumpeter put it,
"people who wield the power of the spoken and the written
word, and one of the touches that distinguish them from
other people who do the same is the absence of direct
responsibility for practical affairs."[^1/3] In some measure, the
advanced industrial societies have spawned a stratum of
value-oriented intellectuals who often devote themselves to
the derogation of leadership, the challenging of authority,
and the unmasking and delegitimation of established
institutions, their behavior contrasting with that of the also
increasing numbers of technocratic and policy-oriented
intellectuals. In an age of widespread secondary school and
university education, the pervasiveness of the mass media,
and the displacement of manual labor by clerical and
professional employees, this development constitutes a
challenge to democratic government which is, potentially at
least, as serious as those posed in the past by the aristocratic
cliques, fascist movements, and communist parties.

In addition to the emergence of the adversary intellectuals
and their culture, a parallel and possibly related trend
affecting the viability of democracy concerns broader
changes in social values. In all three Trilateral regions, a shift
in values is taking place away from the materialistic
work-oriented, public-spirited values toward those which
stress private satisfaction, leisure, and the need for
"belonging and intellectual and esthetic self-fulfillment."[^1/4]
These values are, of course, most notable in the younger
generation. They often coexist with greater skepticism
towards political leaders and institutions and with greater
alienation from the political processes. They tend to be
privatistic in their impact and import. The rise of this
syndrome of values is presumably related to the relative
affluence in which most groups in the Trilateral societies
came to share during the economic expansion of the 1960s.
The new values may not survive recession and resource
shortages. But if they do, they pose an additional new
problem for democratic government in terms of its ability to
mobilize its citizens for the achievement of social and
political goals and to impose discipline and sacrifice upon its
citizens in order to achieve those goals.

Finally, and perhaps most seriously, there are the _intrinsic
challenges_ to the viability of democratic government which
grow directly out of the functioning of democracy.
Democratic government does not necessarily function in a
self-sustaining or self-correcting equilibrium fashion. It may
instead function so as to give rise to forces and tendencies
which, if unchecked by some outside agency, will eventually
lead to the undermining of democracy. This was, of course, a
central theme in de Tocqueville's forebodings about
democracy; it reappeared in the writings of Schumpeter and
Lippmann; it is a key element in the current pessimism about
the future of democracy.

The contextual challenges differ, as we have seen, for each
society. Variations in the nature of the particular democratic
institutions and processes in each society may also make
some types of intrinsic challenges more prominent in one
society than in another. But, overall, the intrinsic threats are
general ones which are in some degree common to the
operation of all democratic systems. The more democratic a
system is, indeed, the more likely it is to be endangered by
intrinsic threats. Intrinsic challenges are, in this sense, more
serious than extrinsic ones. Democracies may be able to
avoid, moderate, or learn to live with contextual challenges
to their viability. There is deeper reason for pessimism if the
threats to democracy arise ineluctably from the inherent
workings of the democratic process itself. Yet, in recent
years, the operations of the democratic process do indeed
appear to have generated a breakdown of traditional means
of social control, a delegitimation of political and other forms
of authority, and an overload of demands on government,
exceeding its capacity to respond.

The current pessimism about the viability of democratic
government stems in large part from the extent to which
contextual threats, societal trends, and intrinsic challenges
have simultaneously manifested themselves in recent years. A
democratic system which was not racked by intrinsic
weaknesses stemming from its own performance as a
democracy could much more easily deal with contextual
policy challenges. A system which did not have such
significant demands imposed upon it by its external
environment might be able to correct the deficiencies which
arose out of its own operations. It is, however, the
conjunction of the policy problems arising from the
contextual challenges, the decay in the social base of
democracy manifested in the rise of oppositionist
intellectuals and privatistic youth, and the imbalances
stemming from the actual operations of democracy itself
which make the governability of democracy a vital and,
indeed, an urgent issue for the Trilateral societies.

This combination of challenges seems to create a situation
in which the needs for longer-term and more broadly
formulated purposes and priorities, for a greater overall
coherence of policy, appear at the same time that the
increasing complexity of the social order, increasing political
pressures on government, and decreasing legitimacy of
government make it more and more difficult for government
to achieve these goals.

The demands on democratic government grow, while the
capacity of democratic government stagnates. This, it would
appear, is the central dilemma of the governability of
democracy which has manifested itself in Europe, North
America, and Japan in the 1970s.
