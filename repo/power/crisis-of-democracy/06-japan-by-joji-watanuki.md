## JAPANESE DEMOCRACY'S GOVERNABILITY

There is no absolute governability or ungovernability.
Governability is always a function of tasks, both imposed
from the outside and generated from the inside, and of
capabilities, of both the elite and the masses.

### External Conditions Surrounding Japanese Democracy

Although there seems to be no impending external threat
of military aggression to Japan, there exist uncertainties of a
military nature which, if they should be actualized, would
impose enormous strains on Japanese leaders. One is the
instability of the Korean situation and possible escalating
confrontation between the Republic of Korea and the
People's Democratic Republic of Korea. Another is the
possibility of Sino-Soviet military confrontation. In both
cases, if the conflicts should escalate enough, they would
cause worldwide repercussions, and the United States, at
least, would inevitably be involved in them. If, however,
the escalation should remain below certain limits and could
be regarded as a local problem, it is possible that particularly
strong pressures to force Japanese decision-makers to make
difficult policy decisions would be generated from both sides
of the conflict. The former, the Korean problem, has a
special significance for the problem of the internal governability
of Japan.

Apart from such critical, and hopefully, improbable cases,
there are two external factors which beset Japan and create
tasks for the Japanese leadership. One is the well-known
international dependency and vulnerability of the Japanese
economy in terms of resources needed not only for industry
but also for feeding the Japanese people. According to
often-cited figures, Japan's ratio of dependency on overseas
resources is: almost 100 percent in oil; 85 percent in total
energy supply, 100 percent in aluminum; and 95 percent for
iron ore (1970 level). Of Japan's total food supply, 23 percent
comes from abroad, and among vital foodstuffs, 92
percent of the wheat and 96 percent of the soybeans consumed
in Japan in 1971 came from abroad. In comparison
with the equivalent figures for the United States, these
figures are impressive enough to show Japan's international
dependency in the acquisition of resources.

Japan's dependency is, however, of the same level as that
of many West European societies. What distinguishes Japan
from West European societies is the second external factor.
Japan stands alone in its region with no equal partner for
joint action, which would share common interests due to a
similar stage of industrial development, combined with the
same degree of commitment to principles of political
democracy. Of course, in spite of the European Community,
West European countries are far from achieving complete
accord and being able to take united action to cope with
their difficulties. And West European countries and the
European Community as a whole always have to take into
consideration the moves of other regions --- those of the Soviet
bloc, the Arab countries, and all other Third World countries.
As the most economically advanced country in Asia and
because of the historical backgrounds of Japan and the
countries of Asia, the Japanese elite and masses are torn
between a feeling of belonging to Asia and a feeling of
isolation from Asia, with an orientation to the United States
and West Europe.[^4/1] On the other hand, the Asian countries
are also ambivalent toward Japan. The Japanese, including
those in other Asian countries, are expected to perform a
positive role because they are Asians; at the same time they
are often severely criticized for certain behavior which would
be permitted for Europeans or Americans. This delicate
position of Japan in the region can be made to serve as an
asset linking the other Asian countries with advanced
economies and those advanced economies with developing
economies in the region. On the other hand, it could become
a liability which could confuse Japan's policy choices and
aggravate the relationship between developing countries and
economically advanced countries.

### Domestic Conditions and Capabilities of Japanese Democracy After World War II

\(a) _Consolidation of postwar democracy_. In discussing the
governability of democracy in Japan, the place to start is
with the reforms after World War II and the 1947 Constitution
of Japan, which is the key political institution of
postwar Japanese democracy. It has been argued that the
Japanese Constitution of 1947 was prepared under the U.S.
occupation. The draft was written by the staff of SCAP
(Supreme Commander of Allied Powers) and General Douglas
MacArthur, and handed to the Japanese government with
strong pressure in early 1947.

However, in spite of apparent record of such imposition or
implantation by the Allied --- and actually American
--- occupation forces, and although there has been a tenacious
movement by rightists both outside and inside the Liberal
Democratic party to abolish this "given Constitution"
and to make an "autonomous" constitution, the 1947
Constitution has been in operation for thirty years and will
be kept intact for the forseeable future, including its unique
Article 9 which forbids Japan to wage war as a nation and to
maintain armed forces. It is a miracle of modern history and
is a key to understanding and predicting Japanese society and
politics.

The miracle occurred for three good reasons.[^4/2] In the first
place, the draft Constitution prepared by SCAP was not
made in a void. It had many ideas in common with a draft
constitution prepared by the Japanese liberals at that time.
Besides the Constitution itself, many postwar reforms
performed under the American occupation were congruent
with (or some steps in advance of) the proposals made by the
liberals and even by the enlightened bureaucrats either then
or even in prewar days. Thus, many reforms made during the
U.S. occupation helped to release and encourage "reform
potentials" which had already accumulated in Japan during
World War II. Second, a positive role was played by the
opposition --- especially that of the Japan Socialist party in the
period of 1952--1955, just after the end of occupation in 1952. The Conservatives, at that time consisting of the Japan
Liberal party and the Japan Democratic party, wanted to
revise the "excessive" reforms made under the occupation
and campaigned for rewriting the whole Constitution. The
key parts of the Constitution which the Conservatives wanted
in common to rewrite were those on the status of the
Emperor, Article 9, and those concerning the family system.
Extreme conservatives wanted more general deliberalization
concerning the rights of labor unions, freedom of speech and
association, and so on. If their attempts had been successful,
what consequences would have followed for Japanese society
and politics? Since this is just a matter of sheer conjecture, it
is open to various arguments. My argument, however, is this:
The consequence would have been less stability in Japanese
politics and the accumulation of more frustration and
alienation among more-educated people and also among
younger people in Japanese society. A Japan with recognized
armed forces but with more domestic political confrontation
and more accumulation of frustration among the populace,
and possibly with repeated attempts at constitutional revision
in both radical and reactionary directions, would have been
possible. As it was, the Socialists, who at that time were
divided between the right-wing Socialists and the left-wing
Socialists but who both agreed to preserve the 1947
Constitution, succeeded in winning one-third of both Houses
of the Diet in elections in the early 1950s and blocked the
Conservatives' attempt to revise the Constitution, which
required the approval of two-thirds of the Diet. The legacy of
the Constitutional dispute in this period still remains in the
usual way of thinking of the 1947 Constitution as one
package, that is, thinking based on an either-or way so that
no part of the Constitution can be revised without rewriting
the whole. Third, the mainstream of the Conservatives --- the
Liberal Democratic party --- is presently indifferent about this
matter and does not want to take the trouble to confront the
Socialists and the _Komei_ party. Behind the Conservative
attitude not to take the trouble to alter the 1947 Constitution
is another factor which has contributed to the consolidation
of that Constitution. In the process of economic growth
in the late 1950s and throughout the 1960s, with a number
of concomitant social changes, the 1947 Constitution and
most of the postwar reforms became necessary to the
operation of the Japanese economy and society. The issues
raised by the Conservatives, especially by the rightist wing of
them, against the 1947 Constitution became obsolete. For
example, the 1947 Constitution and the reform of the family
code assured the independence of family members. Younger
people, who were supposed to be under the control of the
familyhead before the reforms, were given legal freedom
from the family by the postwar reforms and actually received
economic freedom because of the labor shortage and rise of
wages. From the viewpoint of industry, also, voluntary
mobility of younger people irrespective of the assent of the
familyhead was welcome. To the expanding, more-educated
population, which has contributed to the labor force with
higher quality, the idea and stipulation of the status of the
Emperor as a symbol of the state in the 1947 Constitution
has been more acceptable than either the idea of the Emperor
as God in prewar days or the policy of the Conservatives that
the Emperor should have more substantial power. Labor
unions recognized and protected by the 1947 Constitution,
with their peculiarly Japanese form of "enterprise unions,'
were found to be no obstacle to technological innovation and
contributed to the maintenance of commitment of the
workers to the company.

Thus, the mainstream of the Liberal Democratic party and
the mainstream of Japanese economic circles have no serious
intention of revising the 1947 Constitution now or in the
near future. According to opinion polls, the majority of the
public also supports the 1947 Constitution. In addition, the
Socialists and the _Komei_ party are firmly committed to it.
The Japan Communist party has also declared its
commitment to defend the present Constitution, at least in
the near future, although at the same time it does not hide its
view that at some future time the Constitution should be
rewritten in more socialistic style, a point which the _Komei_
party has been fiercely attacking.

Thus, in comparison with the German Weimar Republic of
1919--33 Japanese postwar democracy has a far firmer basis.
A doubt remains about whether or not the Japanese people
have accepted the postwar democratic system primarily
because of Japan's economic prosperity in the postwar
period. However, even if this is so, the prewar system offers
no competing attraction, especially to the younger generation.
There is little possibility of a powerful revival of prewar
Japanese militarism or political traditionalism in the future.
Rather, the problem is how, within the 1947 Constitution,
Japan can handle the status of Japanese Self Defense Forces,
which have been regarded by the Socialist and the Communist
parties as unconstitutional on one hand, and on the
other, have accumulated capability and de facto legitimacy
during their existence and development over twenty years
under the LDP government.

\(b) _The capability of the Liberal Democratic party_. The
Japanese Conservatives, particularly the Liberal Democratic
party since its formation in 1955, have ruled Japan throughout
the postwar period, except for the short and unsuccessful
coalition of the Socialist and Democratic parties in 1947--48.
The capability of the LDP is open to partisan disputes. LDP
people and ardent supporters of the LDP can say that under
the rule of the LDP's majority for twenty years, Japan's
economic growth and its peaceful existence with other
nations are the proofs of the LDP's high capability. The
award of the 1974 Nobel Peace Prize to ex-Prime Minister
Eisaku Sato seems to back up such an argument. But the
opposition parties have naturally been critical of the LDP's
capability and actually expressed astonishment and criticism
of the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Sato. Apart from
such partisan disputes, two observations can be made. First,
the LDP's rule has carried with it both merits and demerits
--- in other words, functions and dysfunctions. Second, the
social and cultural bases which have hitherto supported the
functional side of the LDP have been declining. Thus, the
changing tides of Japanese society seem to be less congruent
with, or more beyond the adaptability of the LDP than
before.

As for the LDP's merits, I can cite three points. First, the
close coordination between the LDP, the higher elite corps of
the bureaucracy, and the economic elite (which have been
called "Japan Incorporated" since _Time_ magazine's story of
May 10, 1971, invented the term), certainly contributed to
Japan's economic growth and will also function positively in
future times of economic crisis through skillful "consensus
economy." Certainly the LDP's capability for policy formation
is high in the sense that it is fused with the bureaucratic
elite. This group consists of ex-high-level bureaucrats, who
became either LDP parliamentary members or top executives
of public and private corporations after their relatively early
retirement (around the ages of fifty to fifty five); of active
senior bureaucrats, and of successive generations of successful
candidates in the higher civil service examination. Ex-highlevel
bureaucrats as LDP politicians contribute their knowledge
and experiences accumulated during their bureaucratic
careers to the formation of policies by the party. They can
also maintain communication with their ex-colleagues in
public and-private corporations and, moreover, may utilize
the cooperation and assistance of their successors on active
duty in the bureaucracy.

Second, the LDP has build up skillful vote-getting machines
in its _koenkai_ (associations supporting individual
politicians), through which various demands --- personal,
regional, and occupational --- of the vast populace have been
absorbed and satisfied. All LDP Diet members maintain their
_koenkai_,[^4/3] which often comprise tens of thousands of
"members" who rarely pay membership dues. Almost all the
expenses to maintain such _koenkai_ are paid by the LDP
politicians themselves, who therefore always badly need
money. LDP politicians are very responsive to their _koenkai_
clients, especially to the key persons in them, who are often
the local influential persons in agricultural associations or
smalland medium-sized trade associations. Therefore, in
spite of its close coordination with big businesses and its
financial dependency on them, the LDP has not ignored the
interests of local leaders in agriculture, fisheries, smalland
medium-sized commerce, and manufacturing. The LDP at the
grass roots level has been loosely structured and has consisted
of federations of hundreds of small parties. Therefore, it has
been able to absorb a variety of interests and demands. As is
well known, however, mainly because of the distribution of
money, LDP politicians are "aggregated" into several
factions, and eventually, the formation of LDP policy is
made in close contact with the bureaucracy and big businesses.
Here, in a sense, there is a beautiful pattern of wide interest
articulation through individual LDP members and their
_koenkai_, with interest aggregation through factions, and
eventual agreement by the triumvirate of big business,
bureaucracy, and the LDP.

Third, although the LDP has been self-identified as a
conservative party and many members of it have expressed
nostalgia for a number of aspects of the prewar system from
time to time, and although a close tie with the United States
has been the LDP's official-line on foreign policy, still LDP
Diet members have enjoyed a wide range of freedom to
express divergent policy views and even behavior concerning
both domestic and foreign policies. In the sphere of foreign
policy, members of the Asian and African Problem Study
Group had visited the People's Republic of China a number
of times before Tanaka's visit to China, and also have been
keeping in contact with the People's Democratic Republic of
Korea. However, the LDP still has strong Taiwan supporters
and also a Korean lobby, composed of those who keep close
ties with the Republic of Korea. In the sphere of domestic
policy, a fairly wide divergence of opinions exists among LDP
politicians. This ideological looseness and vagueness of the
LDP is due to the independence of LDP politicians in
vote-getting and to the nonideological formation of factions
within the LDP, and these characteristics have, in their turn,
contributed to neutralizing the party image against the attack
from the opposition parties that the LDP is a reactionary
party. These characteristics have, moreover, given the LDP
wider channels of contact and assets to be utilized in case of
policy change.

As has been pointed out, all three of these "merits," on
the other hand, carry demerits and involve dysfunctions. On
the first, close contact and skillful coordination between the
groups in the triumvirate has meant their disproportional
predominance in policy formation. Powers to countervail and
check that triumvirate have been disporportionally weak. As
for the second mechanism, the _koenkai_ which have made the
LDP capable of absorbing various interests and demands,
since the supporting groups of LDP are not distributed
equally in terms of region, occupation, and generation,
unavoidably some interests are systematically respected and
others are ignored. And, continuation of LDP rule for nearly
twenty years has generated a sense of alienation from power
and a feeling of ill-treatment in certain sectors of society. To
supporters of the opposition parties, not only LDP rule, but
also the whole period of Japanese history under LDP rule, is
subject to criticism. It has been _their_ rule, and _their_ period,
not _ours_, from this perspective. This kind of feeling of
alienation was clearly expressed when ex-Prime Minister
Eisaku Sato was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Third,
concerning the looseness of ideological control within the
LDP, there is the widely held fear of unpredictability of LDP
behavior. Some policies are formed on the basis of factional
fights or compromise within the LDP, and many others are
made upon consultation with, or according to the advice of,
bureaucratic and business circles. Concerning the former
policies, especially from the viewpoints of opposition parties,
the LDP is a party which can suddenly propose ultraconservative,
even rightist proposals. Partly due to the
result of these features of LDP rule, and partly due to the
nature of the opposition parties --- especially the Japan Socialist
party which has been tightly committed to Marxist
doctrine --- a lack of trust between governing party and
opposition parties has been conspicuous. And also, those
intellectuals supporting the opposition parties are more
numerous and vocal in their criticisms of the LDP than
expected, given the stability and achievements of LDP rule.

Another source of vulnerability of the LDP is an ethical
one concerning its way of procuring and spending political
funds. All LDP politicians have to constantly procure and
spend money in order to maintain their own _koenkai_. The
minimum necessary expenditure of LDP Diet Members is said
to be 3 million yen (10,000 U.S. dollars) per month in an
off-election period. They raise part of this money themselves,
and part comes from their faction leaders. Faction leaders
have to take care of the funds of their followers. And it has
been a well-known fact that the main part of these political
funds is given by business corporations. The points are: Are
huge sums of political donations by business corporations
really pure and voluntary contributions, or is this implicit
bribery? And is it fair political competition that the LDP and
LDP factions combined are spending political funds five
times larger than the total political funds spent by all four
opposition parties together according to an official report
released by the government?[^4/4] Moreover, it is widely believed
that the actual total of political spending by the LDP is more
than this official record.

It is a well-known fact that the LDP's share of the votes in
national elections has been gradually declining. Although in
the case of the House of Representatives the LDP still
maintained a 46.8 percent share of the votes in the 1972
general election, the LDP share fell below 40 percent (39.5
percent) in the Prefectural Constituency of the election of
the House of Councillors in 1974. Partly due to the
overrepresentation of the rural districts in the Diet and partly
due to the split of the opposition parties, the LDP still
succeeds in getting a majority of the seats in the Houses (271
out of 491 in the House of Representatives, and 126 out of
252 in the House of Councillors). The LDP's majority is slim
in the House of Councillors, however, and the LDP lacks
sufficient majority legitimacy even in the House of Representatives
due to rural overrepresentation and disproportional
spending of political funds.

\(c) _Quality of the Japanese bureaucracy_. Although it
depends on the definition of governability, in any understanding
of governability as a synthetic capability relating the
governing and the governed, the quality of bureaucracy, as
the governing framework or as an intermediary between the
governing and the governed or as an autonomous third force,
has special significance. In this respect, the Japanese bureaucracy
seems to deserve some attention. Historically, the
Japanese bureaucracy was formed after the Prussian model,
legacies of which remain even today in formalistic legalism
and alleged neutralism which does not, however, prevent the
high bureaucrats from committing themselves to partisan
stands of the governing party, as representing the interest of
the state. Many high-level bureaucrats, after retirement, have
joined the LDP and, after their successful election, have
become key figures in the governing party. The bureaucrats,
on duty are, however, fairly autonomous under the control
of administrative vice-ministers and the elite bureaucratic
corps has a high degree of esprit de corps, similar to the
British Civil Service. During the recent period of economic
growth, mainly in the Ministries of Finance[^4/5] and of
International Trade and Industry, and in the Economic
Planning Agency, technocrats, consisting primarily of economic
specialists, have been gaining power, and in this
predominance of technocrats, Japanese bureaucracy can be
compared with the French bureaucracy.

Thus, the capability of Japanese bureaucracy can be
evaluated as rather high. The members of the elite bureaucratic
corps, consisting of those who passed the higher civil
service examination --- whose number is still limited to 400 or
so annually in this age of expansion of higher education with
1.5 million university students, are really elite both in terms
of their initial caliber and the opportunities for training and
accumulation of administrative experience given to them
during their careers. This elite bureaucratic corps of about
10,000 is still prepared today to work twenty-four hours per
day and seven days a week if necessary, because of its
privileged position of good care and faster promotion and the
prevailing ethos of diligence and self-sacrifice in the elite.

There are, however, dysfunctions and vulnerability in the
Japanese bureaucracy. The top level of the Japanese bureaucratic
elite corps and alumni from this group have been too
fused with the LDP. Furthermore, with the expansion of
higher education, a system designed to recruit only 400 or so
per year to the elite bureaucratic corps cannot maintain itself
forever. Actually, many university graduates are taking
examinations for middle civil service positions which have
been intended for high school or junior college graduates.
The point is that in such a situation it will become difficult
to give special favor to those who passed higher civil service
examinations and to discriminate against other members of
the bureaucracy who are now also university graduates. In
the near future the notion and practice of the elite
bureaucratic corps will be forced to give way to more
egalitarian, less privileged forms. Local governments have
been doing this already. For instance, the Tokyo metropolitan
government has been recruiting several hundred university
graduates on an equal basis. In addition it has been an
established practice for Japanese ministries to recruit their
own personnel, both elite and non-elite, as the personnel of
their own ministries only. The aim has been to build up the
ministry's own bureaucracy of specialists on matters over
which that ministry presides and to build up strong solidarity
in the elite bureaucratic corps within a particular ministry.
This practice has brought with it the pattern of ministerial
bureaucrats acting to promote the interests of their clienteles
and ardently promoting interests and demands within their
jurisdictions even in dispute with the governing party, thus
serving as guardians of interests which might be neglected by
the governing party. But, the cost paid for this is bureaucratic
sectionalism and there is no bureau to take care of overall
policy. To be sure there are the Prime Minister's office and
the Cabinet Secretariat, which are supposed to perform this
function, but these bureaucrats come from various ministries,
serve for a couple of years, and go back to their home
ministries; therefore, they are likely to remain committed to
the particular interests of their home ministries.

\(d) _The economy_. As is well known, Japanese economic
growth during the two decades before the oil crisis of October
1973 was amazing, continuously maintaining an annual
growth rate over 10%. GNP and also per capita income doubled
every five years. Even considering the rise of commodity
prices, real wages still nearly doubled between 1960 and 1972.[^4/6] Japan's GNP is larger than that of any West European
country and its per capita income or wage is roughly equal
with, or even slightly more than, that of Britain or France,
according to the statistics. With this growth of GNP and increase
of per capita income and wages, government revenue
and spending have expanded enormously. From 1965 to
1973, for instance, the government budget grew from 3,658
billion yen to 14, 284 billion yen, that is, over three times.[^4/7]
In other words, so far, with the growth of the Japanese economy,
the government has acquired tremendous amounts of
goods and services which it can dispose, and this has made it
possible for the Japanese government to distribute goods and
services in response to the increased demands of the populace.
Under these circumstances, government has been able to
avoid serious priority problems.

Again, as is well known, since the successive revaluation of
the yen, the oil crisis and the subsequent jump of oil prices,
the picture has been changing rapidly. The growth rate for
fiscal year 1973 (April 1973 to March 1974) dropped sharply
to 5.4 percent, and that for the 1974 fiscal year was
eventually found to be minus (-1.8 percent). According to
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), the
expected growth rate for 1975 is 2 percent. Although
somewhat slowed, the rise of consumer prices as of March
1975 in comparison with the previous year was still 13
percent. The government target is to lower the rise of
consumer prices to a single digit by the end of 1975. In this
economic situation, the national government could still
increase its budget to 17. 180 billion ven in the 1974 fiscal
year and 21,280 billion yen in fiscal year 1975, without
creating serious deficits and increasing the rate of inflation,
but local governments now face serious deficits in their
budgets. It is expected that the national government too will
face a tighter financial situation and priority problems in
budget-making for next fiscal year, beginning in April 1976.

As for the longer economic perspective, the government
defines the period from 1974 to 1976 as an adjustment
period from rapid economic growth to stable economic
growth or a "less accelerated" economy, as it is called. After
1976, the MITI is expecting an annual economic growth rate
of about 7 percent. If so, this moderate growth can bring
with it some leeway for priority problems but that leeway
will be far more restricted in comparison with previous years
of more than 10 percent growth of the economy.

\(e) _Mass media_. Development of mass media in Japan is
quite conspicuous. The total number of copies of newspapers
issued daily is 56 million copies, which is second only to that
of the United States (63 million copies). The estimated
number of television sets currently in use is 48 million, and
there are five nationwide television networks --- one is the
publicly operated NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation)
and the other four are privately owned (NTV, TBS, Fuji, and
NET).[^4/8] Besides the press and TV, the plethora of magazines
is a characteristic of the Japanese mass media scene. In
particular, the variety of weekly magazines with huge
circulations (about fifty different weekly magazines are
selling eight million copies per month) is striking.

What is the relevance of the Japanese mass media to the
governability of Japanese democracy? Under the postwar
democracy, there has been no governmental censorship
except during the occupation period, and all the major
newspapers and TV networks have been avowed guardians of
democracy. Their quality is not bad, especially the five major
newspapers with nationwide circulation (_Asahi_, _Mainichi_,
_Yomiuri_, _Sankei_, and _Nihon Keizai_), which are proud of
being quality newspapers with circulations of several million
and which compete with each other in terms of their
excellence.

Thus we can say that the Japanese mass media as a whole
are a positive factor in the maintenance and operation of
Japanese democracy. However, the Japanese mass media have
several characteristics peculiar to Japan, which function as a
kind of constraint, within which Japanese democracy has to
operate and which might make Japanese democracy
vulnerable under possible changed conditions.

First, as has often been pointed out, Japanese newspapers
are highly standardized, in the sense that they tend to refrain
from presenting partisan opinion, and allocate their space in a
quite similar way to coverage of 'everything from on-thestreet
human interest stories to highbrow academic articles.

Second, alongside their nonpartisanship, another
established characteristic of Japanese newspapers is what is
called their "opposition spirit," which means critical of the
government, but within the limits of nonpartisanship. The
result is that nonpartisan intellectual radicalism is treated
rather favorably in the newspapers and a tone of moral
sensationalism colors the reports and articles in newspapers.

In the case of broadcasting, NHK clings more strictly to
the principle of nonpartisanship and to a less critical spirit
than the newspapers. Other TV networks are more and more
tied to particular major newspapers and show similar
characteristics to these newspapers in their reporting.
However, sensationalism is more obvious in several weekly
magazines, such as _Shukan-Post_, _Shukan-Gendai_ and, although
in a rather conservative tone, _Shukan-Shincho_, each
of which sells over 500,000 copies every week.

Those characteristics of Japanese mass media can have
both positive and negative functions for the governability of
Japanese democracy. The newspapers' and NHK's nonpartisanship
is good in preventing manipulation by the powerful
mass media. Sensationalism has helped to arouse the attention
of the public to politics from issue to issue as they arise.
Negative functions, however, also follow from these characteristics.
Nonpartisanship of the mass media can bring with it
the loss of the function of stimulating political discussion,
and the critical spirit and moral sensationalism can obstruct
necessary mobilization of support by the government and
encourage political distrust of the government.

\(f) _Education_. Expansion of higher education in Japan has
been amazing during the past decade. The percentage of
those enrolling in universities and colleges among the eligible
age group has doubled during the decade and reached 30
percent in 1974. Furthermore, it is expected that his trend
will continue and that enrollment will reach 40 percent by 1980. From an educational standpoint, the Japanese university
system has a number of problems to be solved,[^4/9] but
only the political relevance of this expansion of higher
education will be considered here.

So far, university expansion has had relatively little direct
impact on politics. Of course, there has been sporadic campus
unrest, emergence of a variety of radical groups recruited
from university students, and participation of a number of
students in antipollution movements. Also, the Japan Communist
Party has maintained its influence on student movements
through its Democaratic Youth League, and the
League's members are quite active in assisting JCP's election
campaigns. However, a majority of the 1.5 million Japanese
university students and the couple millions of recent graduates
have been relatively calm politically. One of the reasons
for this calm has been the favorable situation of the
job market for rapidly expanding numbers of university
graduates. The decade has witnessed an enormous expansion
of tertiary industries and of professional, technical, and
clerical jobs, which have absorbed a couple million university
graduates. The shortage of young blue-collar workers resulted
in the improvement of the wages of not only young
blue-collar workers but also of young white-collar workers. In
spite of an ongoing change of values in the younger
generation, organizational disciplines regulating the new
recruits in business or bureaucracy have persisted and have
been successful in making them adapt to organizational
norms. Moreover, so far the expansion of higher education
has coincided with the expansion of local governmental
activities and personnel. The percentage of university graduates
among newly recruited civil servants on the local
government level has increased rapidly, which has certainly
contributed to upgrading the quality of the local civil
service.

Another aspect of higher education has been the increase
of social science specialists in the universities, some of whom
have begun to keep closer contact with governmental
policy-making than previous Japanese university professors.
In the fields of econometrics, social engineering, and regional
planning a number of specialists are giving more advice and
keeping close contact with the government. On the other
hand, expansion of higher education has also brought with it
an increasing number of intellectual oppositionists. In Japan's
case, however, intellectual opposition has a long tradition.
What is new is the emergence of policy-oriented fields of
social science and policy-oriented intellectuals prepared to
give advice to government.

The crucial question, however, is whether the Japanese
economy can continue to offer suitable jobs to university
graduates who constitute over 30 percent or even 40 percent
of the corresponding age group. And another crucial question
is the cost and quality of higher education. Government has
been increasing the appropriation of public funds to assist
private universities. In the expected tight budgetary situation,
whether government can and should expand such assistance is
questionable.

\(g) _Labor unions_. In postwar Japanese democracy, labor
unions have established their recognized position firmly.
Also, Japanese labor unions with their form of "enterprise
union" --- meaning that unions have been organized
corresponding to the scope of each company, embracing all
employees in that company --- have had no essential objection
to the introduction of technological innovations so long as
the company has guaranteed favorable treatment and offered
retraining to those who were transferred to new jobs in the
company, unlike British unions based on a particular job or
craft. In spite of their basic form of "enterprise union,"
Japanese labor unions have succeeded in building up
federations of unions within the same kind of industries, and
eventually national, federations of labor unions. (Sohyo and
Domei are two big national federations of labor unions which
have been exercising fairly strong influence through their
jointly scheduled plan of wage-raise demands \[the so-called
"spring struggle"\] and electoral campaigning in support of
the opposition parties. Sohyo supports the Socialists and
Domei supports the Democratic Socialists.)

Present-day democracy cannot exist without the recognition
of, and support from, labor unions. Actually, the
Japanese labor unions, especially the two big national
federations, have been the avowed guardians of postwar
democracy, although in different senses and directions. Sohyo
has been in close cooperation with the Socialists, not completely
unfavorable to the Communists, and definitely against
the LDP. Domei has been supporting more moderate Democratic
Socialists. While definitely against the Communists, it
has been prepared to cooperate with the LDP and LDP
government upon certain conditions.

The roles to be played by labor unions in a democracy,
however, involve a number of delicate situations. In Japan's
case, even under the LDP government which has had no labor
union to support it, government cannot ignore labor unions
in labor administration and has had representatives of Sohyo
and Domei on a number of Deliberation Councils on
labor administration and also on Labor Relations
Committees. But essentially, the LDP has been on the side of
business and more concerned with the interests of its
supporters --- farmers, small and medium-size manufacturers,
and all other miscellaneous people organized into their own
_koenkai_. One might argue that it has been rather a good
balance since organized labor has had powerful say even if
it has not been respected by the LDP. The opposite argument
is that organized labor should have been respected
more in order to counterbalance the influence of big business
on LDP governments. Some people argue that organized
labor has been representing not only the interests of its members
but also all those who have been unfavorably treated
under LDP governments. The third view, which has been
emerging recently, does not trust either LDP governments or
labor unions. It insists that since labor unions represent the
interests of only a fraction of the total population (only
about 30 percent of the employed are organized into labor
unions) and since the two national federations represent an
even smaller fraction (Sohyo, with its 4 million membership,
organizes 10 percent; and Domei, with its 2.5 million membership,
7 percent of the total employed), the interests of
ordinary citizens should be respected more, that is, emerging
consumers' movements and various citizens' movements
should be respected more than, or at least alongside, organized
labor in order to increase the responsiveness and equity
of Japanese democracy.

## CHANGING VALUES, NEW GENERATIONS AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE GOVERNABILITY OF JAPANESE DEMOCRACY

Since values determine the way people think and act, it is
important to see how changing values, which are most
conspicuously observable in the younger generation and are
expected to accumulate in years to come, will affect the
governability of Japanese democracy.

### Political Beliefs

\(a) _The 1947 Constitution as a package as the key political
belief_. All the survey data collected in recent years reinforce
the point that there is no sign of weakening of the support
for the 1947 Constitution as a whole. On the contrary,
younger and more-educated people tend to support more
strongly the 1947 Constitution as a whole, including its
Article 9 forbidding Japan to wage a war and to have armed
forces for that purpose.[^4/10] Therefore, the 1947 Constitution
has become a given.

One argument against the Constitution is that the Japanese
warlike" national character will not change so easily;
therefore, if international situations slightly change, the
Japanese will easily change their minds and discard the 1947
Constitution, especially its Article 9. But this kind of
argument, which is often found among overseas Chinese
scholars, is highly improbable. Another argument stresses
that if some grave change should occur in international
relations, in other words if some real threat of aggression to
Japan by some foreign powers should occur, the Japanese
"mood" would change rapidly to support rearmament and
consequently a revision of the 1947 Constitution. The
possibility certainly exists, but this argument seems to be
based on assumptions of low probability.

At the same time, because of the recent activities of the
Japanese Red Army abroad, there are continued possibilities
that minority radicals will resort to individual or small group
terrorism both abroad and at home. These incidents are not
the expression of general bellicosity of the Japanese people,
but the expression of New Left minority radicals, also widely
found in North America and West European countries, and of
Japanese ignorance of the Arabs and the lack of a connection
between Japanese radicalism and Jewish intellectuals, such as
is found in North America or Western Europe.

It is undeniable that the radical minorities on the far left
will continue to commit terrorism abroad in supporting the
Arabs (or, precisely, being utilized by the Arabs) and within
Japan by bombing the offices of such companies as the
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Company or the Mitsui Bussan,
Company. The ultrarightists, too, will be able to recruit a
small number of new members constantly from the youth
both in and outside universities, and they might succeed in
political terrorism in the future too, such as the assassination
of the Socialists' Chairman Inejiro Asanuma, which occurred
in 1960. As a whole, however, the Japanese younger
generations have the political beliefs congruent with, and
definitely supporting, the 1947 Constitution.

\(b) _Emergence of "participation" and "protest" motivations
and movements_. An ongoing change of political
beliefs is occurring, which is not incompatible with the
beliefs in the 1947 Constitution, but is not identical with it,
and which will exercise a far-reaching influence on the future
of Japanese democracy. It is a change from submissiveness to
authority to active protest and demands for participation,
that is, from "subject" political culture to "participatory"
political culture. There are excellent data which show this
change. (Table 1).

Two comments are specially warranted on this table. When
the first survey was conducted in 1953, a majority of the
Japanese over twenty years old were prepared to leave things
to competent politicians, if such were available. In other
words, at that time, the majority of the masses were prepared
to obey a competent politician; therefore, the governability
problem was simply a problem of the politicians--that is,
whether such competent politicians were available or not.
During the period of economic growth, people have become
more self-assertive and have come to dislike leaving things
even to competent politicians. Then, the governability
problem becomes not only the problem of the competence of
the governing, but the problem of both the governing and the
governed.

Other transnational data show the existence of the
phenomena of increasing demands for participation in Japan
similar to those in West European and North American
countries. Respondents in a poll were asked to choose two
most important values from "law and order," "encouragement
of more participation in vital political decisions,"
"restraint of the rise of prices," and "freedom of speech,'
values which were used in Professor Ronald Inglehart's six
West European surveys.[^4/11] Japanese respondents reacted in
the following way. According to the marginal distribution,
"price restraint" was the first choice (70.4 percent), and the
others followed with "law and order" (45.3 percent), "participation"
(35.1 percent), and "freedom of speech" (13.8
percent). The age and educational differences, however,
were conspicuous. Among younger people in their twenties
and those with university education, the choice of "participation"
surpassed that of "law and order" and gained the
second ranking after "price restraint." In combinations of
two values, the combination of "participation and free
speech," which Professor Inglehart assumed to be the pure
type of "postindustrial value," was less popular in Japan than
in West European countries. Japanese responses, however,
were more concentrated in the intermediary type of "prices
and participation." (Tables 2 and 3.) And again, the younger
and the more-educated clearly show their preference for the
value of participation. (Among those in their twenties, about
15 percent prefer the combination of "participation and free
speech," and, if coupled with "participation and prices,"
they are the top choice.)

The heightening of participatory motivation, however, is
often related to increasing distrust of institutionalized
channels of participation --- that is, elections and political
parties. Thus, the other side of the coin is the decline of
political parties and rise of various voluntary citizens' and
residents' movements which dislike and refuse to follow the
leadership of any political party and prefer protests instead
of institutionalized participation. Respondents in a recent
nationwide survey[^4/12] were asked the question "which would
you prefer about the future of Japanese party politics--one,
to back up the political party which can be relied on; two, to
promote citizens' or residents' movements as they become
necessary; three, I have nothing to do with political parties or
politics at all?" The responses divided as follows: 57.0
percent chose the first response, 17.3 percent the second, and
5.3 percent the third. The distribution is not so bad from the
viewpoint of political parties. Again, however, the younger
(among those in their twenties, 22.4 percent prefer citizens'
movements to parties and 6.5 percent are totally against
politics) and the more-educated (23.1 percent of the university
graduates prefer citizens' movements rather than political
parties) have less trust in institutional channels of participation
and are turning more to uninstitutional, protest-oriented
movements.

Protest-oriented movements have been spreading beyond
the younger and more-educated people and beyond urban
and industrial areas to older, less-educated people and to
local, agricultural, and fishery areas. The _Mutsu_, the first
Japanese nuclear-powered test ship, drifted for fifty-four
days because of fierce protest actions of the fishermen of the
bay in which the base for that ship was located. There were
complicated reasons for this protest. Fear of nuclear
accidents and consequent possible contamination was
certainly one of the reasons. However, the antipathy of the
fishermen, living in the "periphery" and ill-treated by the
"center" for a long time, against the government was
reported to be another reason. The point of the drifting
incident of the _Mutsu_ was that, whatever the reasons for the
protest were, even the fishermen in remote local areas were
prepared to organize protest movements when they felt the
government was doing them an injustice. Also, farmers are no
longer silent and obedient to the government whenever they
feel they are treated unjustly.

If "governability" involves the capacity of the government
to impose policies or plans unilaterally which will affect the
living of the citizens concerned, certainly such governability
in Japan has decreased. The Japanese government, however,
because of its long tradition of _Obrigkeit-staat_, often violates
the usual standard of democracy in its behavior vis-à-vis
citizens. In order to talk about the governability of
democracy in the Japanese case, sometimes democracy
should still be emphasized at the cost of governability.
Moreover, the cost can be partly covered by learning and
efforts on the side of bureaucrats to be more careful and
humane in doing their business. Fortunately, Japanese
bureaucrats --- both national and local --- nowadays have such a
learning capacity. Another factor which has worked so far in
recent years is the financial ability of government to afford
additional spending in order to appease the protest
movements by compensating the alleged damage or promising
costly changes of plans. It is certainly an easy solution,
avoiding the priority problem, which will become difficult in
the approaching tighter governmental budget situation.

### Social and Economic Values

In a society such as Japan after World War II, where
indoctrination from above with the threat of punishment was
nonexistent, where any kind of religious inhibitions after
the separation of the Shinto from the state were virtually
nonexistent, and where social changes, such as urbanization,
rise of income, and change of consumption styles due to the
rapid economic changes, were so rapid, it would be natural to
expect that every aspect of social relationships and values
underlying them would change considerably. Again, the most
illuminating data showing the kinds of changes of social
relations and their underlying values are found in the surveys
conducted by the Institute of Statistical Mathematics,
Ministry of Education every five years since 1953. One
question notes that "there are all sorts of attitudes toward
life. Of those listed here (the list is shown), which one would
you say comes closest to your feeling?" The percentages of
those who picked "don't think about money or fame, just
live a life that suits your own tastes," have increased from 21
percent in 1953 to 27 percent in 1958, 30 percent in 1963,
32 percent in 1968, and 39 percent in 1973 by national
average.[^4/13] People have come to prefer less strenuous, more
relaxed ways of life. The change has been most conspicuous
among the younger generation.

What are the effects of such value changes on Japanese
working behavior? Other survey data[^4/14] show that the
younger workers have stronger demands for shorter working
hours, more holidays, and longer vacations, as well as more
opportunity for self-actualization on the job. (Table 4).
However, the same table tells us about a number of other
features of Japanese workers' demands. (1) Even among the
young workers wage raises is still the most outstanding
demand. Money is not the goal of life as the survey data
show; however, wage increases are the gravest concern for
workers in all ages. (2) Middle-aged people, especially those
with growing families, have an increased desire to own a
house, particularly on their own land, which will serve as
security in an age of continued inflation. (3) Senior workers
are naturally more concerned about their retirement, health
care, and other welfare measures.

: Table 4 - Demands Raised by Male Workers (M.A.) (in percentages)

In spite of the changing values of the workers, the
Japanese organizations --- both governmental organizations and
private enterprises --- have coped skillfully so far in maintaining
a high level of motivation for work among their employees,
as indicated by a very low rate of absence (2.12 percent in a
survey of February 1973 [^4/15]). The reasons for this success are:
(1) The workforce still contains a large proportion of older
generations who are committed to older values which lay
emphasis on dedication to hard work and loyalty to the
organizations. It is often pointed out that the middle-aged,
middle-management people in particular have a generational
feature of this kind. (2) Japanese big organizations with their
paternalistic tradition have the capacity and resources to
absorb a variety of demands of the workers of various
generations including the youngest: better medical care,
housing loans with lower interest, better recreational
facilities, and of course, so far, large annual increases in
wages. Moreover, they are now introducing a five-day work
week, longer vacations, and an extension of the retirement
age from fifty-five to sixty --- on these points, they are in a
position to make concessions to workers' demands. (3) The
Japanese younger generation is, in comparison with the
previous, older generation, less work-oriented, less
organization-oriented, and more self-assertive. In comparison
with West European or American youth, however, the
present Japanese youth still retains some virtues favorable to
the functioning of organizations if the Japanese organizations
are clever enough to make an improvement in their
operations. For instance, according to national character
surveys, the preference of the Japanese for department chiefs
who are paternalistic over those who are rationally specific
remains unchanged,[^4/16] Many of them want "self-actualization
_on the job_." According to an eleven-country study of youth
conducted by the Japanese government, the percentages of
Japanese youth who have chosen "a job worth doing" as the
most precious thing in their lives are the highest among the
countries surveyed. In spite of signs of decline and less
diffuse commitment to the organizations among Japanese
youth, comparatively speaking, the Japanese youth are
still seeking more from the organizations, and, when organizations
are flexible enough to introduce an improvement
to take care of more self-assertive youth, they can
maintain a fairly high level of work motivation among
the youth, keeping the basic lines of Japanese organizations
such as life employment, enterprise union, diffuse social
relationships within the organizations, and so on. For
example, so far there has never even been serious discussion
of abolishing the belt conveyor system in assembly lines in
Japanese factories.

All the labor and business specialists seem to agree[^4/17] that
the Japanese organizational structures with life employment,
enterprise unions, relatively strong commitment to the
organizations, and higher motivation to work will survive at
least until 1980, as far as the internal factors within them are
concerned. Conversely, this means that in the first part of the
1980s Japan will reach the critical point where the
accumulated changes of work ethics, attitudes toward life,
and those toward company and union will necessitate
corresponding changes in the hitherto established institutions
and practices in labor relations. Therefore, it will be wiser for
Japanese society to prepare for that period and preempt
some of the anticipated reforms in advance.

## CONSEQUENCES FOR AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES ON THE GOVERNABILITY OF JAPANESE DEMOCRACY

### Time Lag

Comparing the three regions, Japanese democracy seems to
be suffering less from various changes which have already had
threatening effects on democracies in the other two regions.
Japan seems to be enjoying the time lag between causes
already occurred and the consequences to follow, partly
due to the remaining reservoir of traditional values,[^4/18] and
partly due to the structure of its economy.

### Decline of Leadership and Delay of Decisions

Some of the consequences of these changes have, however,
already emerged to weaken the leadership capacity of
Japanese democracy, and the world situation has been
changing in the direction of demanding more positive action
of Japan, which will be generated only by a higher level of
leadership capacity.

As is well known, the LDP is facing the possibility of
losing its majority position in the Diet. The opposition
parties are split, that is, there is no opposition party which
can take the responsibility of governing by itself. Of course, a
multiparty system and coalition formation are not
intrinsically dysfunctional to the operation of democracy.
Moreover, the LDP as the majority governing party for twenty
years generated a number of dysfunctions such as a sense
of alienation on the part of the supporters of opposition
parties, excessive fusion of the LDP with the bureaucracy and
big business, the ethical problem of political funds, and
sporadic attempts to revive some part of prewar institutions,
thereby causing unnecessary friction.[^4/19] On the other hand,
since coalition formation is quite a new experience to Japanese
politics on the national level, some confusion and delay
of decision would be unavoidable. Especially in foreign
policy decision-making, any coalition --- even the most moderate
one of the LDP and the small Democratic Socialists --- will
bring with it a weakening of the Japan-U.S. alliance to some
degree and probably recourse to a less positive role in international
affairs, from the U.S. viewpoint. In other words,
coalition formation can bring a more drifting or flexible
foreign policy than that under the LDP's single rule.[^4/20]
Domestically also, a multiparty system and coalition
formation are good for interest articulation but not necessarily
good for interest aggregation. Even under the LDP's
single rule, pressure groups have been rampant in getting
shares in the government budget. Any coalition will be exposed
to more diverse pressures in budget-making and policy
formation.

## Vagaries of Urban, Educated Nonpartisans

A decade ago, the Socialists seemed to have a bright
future, replacing the LDP and taking the position of
governing party at some time. The Socialists were then
getting the support of the more-educated in the urban
areas.[^4/21] Today, however, in the urban areas, not only the
LDP, but also the Socialists are declining. The _Komei_, the
Communists and, although in less degree, the Democratic
Socialists are getting a larger share of the votes than before.
But these parties are also uncertain about their future
because what exists in big cities is a vast number of floating
voters with a nonpartisan orientation, whose educational
level is high. It seems that no single party will be able to
organize this section of the voters as the solid basis of
support for it. Fortunately, the possibility is quite slim or
nonexistent that these people will come to support the
extreme rightists or extreme leftists even in the case of a
sudden international or domestic crisis. But they are
vagarious in voting, switching their votes from one party to
another, and they like to vote for a popular nonpartisan
candidate if such a candidate can be found. Successful
candidates in gubernatorial elections or mayoral elections in
urban areas are those who can appeal to this kind of voter in
addition to gaining the support of more than one party. The
increasing importance of urban, educated nonpartisans has a
positive function in making politicians and political parties
more responsive to the demands of the populace outside their
regular supporters. However, by encouraging excessive
populistic responsiveness by the politicians and political
parties, this can also lower their capacity for integration.

## The Place of the Communists in the Multiparty System

The Japan Communist party (JCP) has been successful in
recent elections in increasing its votes and seats at both the
national and local level. To take the case of the House of
Representatives, the JCP's votes have increased from 2.2
million votes (4.76 percent of the total votes cast) in 1967 to
3.2 million votes (6.81 percent) in 1969, and to 5.5 million
votes (10.49 percent) in 1972. Especially in metropolitan
areas, the JCP is now getting about 20 percent of the total
vote. And the JCP has more than 300,000 members (virtually
the largest solid party membership in Japan) and its
daily party newspaper has more than a million circulation. A
number of prefectural governors and big city mayors were
elected with the joint support of the JCP together with the
Socialists, and, in some cases, the _Komei_ party.

Does the JCP present any possible threat to the
governability of Japanese democracy in near future? Most of
the observations seem to support the negative, that is,
optimistic answer, for the following reasons. First, the JCP
seems to be approaching its ceiling in terms of share of the
votes. As a nationwide average 15 percent would be the
ceiling at least for the 1970s, with 30 percent in metropolitan
areas where the JCP is maintaining its strongholds. Second, a
major factor which contributed to the increase of support for
the JCP is its soft and flexible domestic policies and
nationalistic foreign policies independent from the Soviet and
Chinese Communist parties. Domestically, the JCP with an
average of 15 percent of the votes, or 30 percent in big cities,
adopting soft lines would do no harm at all to Japanese
democracy. Many domestic issues would be negotiable with
this kind of JCP. In the foreign policy area, an independent
and nationalistic JCP would function as a factor to enhance
Japan's isolation, not only from the United States but also
from China and other Asian countries. In this respect, it can
be said that the JCP would work dysfunctionally.

## What-Will Happen in the 1980s?

Japanese democracy is not in a serious crisis at the present
moment. However, the time lag mentioned above means that
Japanese democracy will face the consequences of social
changes in a future, possibly tighter situation. In comparison
with the United States, where the "democratic surge" can be
regarded as already having passed the peak, in Japan there is
no sign of decline in the increasing tide of popular demands.
On the other hand, financial resources of the government are
showing signs of stagnation. The reservoir of traditional
values of obedience, groupism, frugality, etc., which are still
working to counterbalance the rising tide of popular demands
and protest, might be exhausted at some future time. Thus,
the emergence of the time-lagged consequences and the
exhaustion of the "traditional" reservoir will both come in
the early 1980s, as many people argue.

What will become of Japanese democracy after 1980?
According to a survey on national goals,[^4/22] a majority of the
Japanese leaders surveyed believe that Japan will continue to
be committed to democratic principles and to a "uniquely
Japanese democracy" in the future. But what this would be
and how it can be built are still unclear.

[^4/4]: According to the report on the revenue of political funds
compiled by Ministry of Autonomy for the first half of 1974, out of a
registered total of 51.6 billion yen ($172 million) in political funds, the
LDP itself and LDP factions together got 40 billion yen. See The
_Yomiuri Shimbun_, December 25, 1974. Moreover, it is widely believed
that, if we take "hidden money" into consideration, the LDP is
spending more. For instance, it was pointed out that the actual sum of
money the LDP spent in 1972 was nearly 100 billion yen, although the
official record for that year was 26 billion yen. See _Bungei Shunju_,
September 1974.

[^4/5]: In a survey on Bureay and Section Chiefs in the Japanese
national bureaucracy, 37 percent answered that they are independent
when asked about their party preference. Especially in the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry and the Economic Planning Agency,
the majority chose the position of independent. This is proof of the
high political neutrality of technocrats. Nikkei Business Henshubu,

[^4/18]: Since the oil crisis, many observers argue that we have to return
to traditional values. For instance, ex-Vice Minister of MITI, Eimei
Yamashita, answered a question by Bernard Krisher, _Newsweek's_
Tokyo bureau chief, as follows: Question: What about the impact of
Japan's economic crunch on traditional values?" Answer: "I see it as
leading to a return to traditional values rather than a departure from
them. During the past decade, Japanese youth abandoned all ideas of
saving. They spent lavishly on clothes, electronics, and cars. But since
the oil crisis, we have returned to more basic Japanese concepts. I don't
think we will revert entirely to the mentality of Tokugawa feudalism,
but we will be able to strike a happy balance." _Newsweek_, November
18, 1974, p. 15.

[^4/19]: For instance, even today, under the Miki Cabinet, some LDP
members are tenaciously trying to make the Yasukuni shrine --- a Shinto
shrine dedicated to those who died in battle since Meiji --- a national
institution, despite fierce protest from not only opposition parties but
also Christians.

[^4/20]: Whether Japanese foreign policy will be labeled "drifting" or
"flexible" depends on whether we can establish our own principles of
diplomacy under a multiparty system or not.
