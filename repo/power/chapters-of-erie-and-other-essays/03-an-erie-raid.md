# An Erie Raid[^/135]

History scarcely affords a parallel to the rapid development
of character which took place in America during
the five years of the late civil war. At its close the ordinary
results of long internal strife were conspicuous only by their
absence. No chronic guerilla warfare was sustained in the
South, and in the North no unusual license or increase of
crime revealed the presence of a million of men unaccustomed
to habits of industry and inured to a life of arms. Yet while
these superficial indications of change would be sought in
vain, other and far more suggestive phases of development
cannot but force themselves on the attention of any thoughtful
observer. The most noticeable of these is perhaps to be
found in a greatly enlarged grasp of enterprise and increased
facility of combination. The great operations of war, the
handling of large masses of men, the influence of discipline,
the lavish expenditure of unprecedented sums of money, the
immense financial operations, the possibilities of effective cooperation,
were lessons not likely to be lost on men quick to
receive and to apply all new ideas. Those keen observers who
looked for strange and unexpected phenomena when the struggle
in the field was over have indeed witnessed that which
must have surpassed all anticipation.

[^/135]: From the North American Review for April, 1871.

If the five years that succeeded the war have been marked
by no exceptional criminal activity, they have witnessed some
of the most remarkable examples of organized lawlessness,
under the forms of law, which mankind has yet had an opportunity
to study. If individuals have, as a rule, quietly pursued
their peaceful vocations, the same cannot be said of
certain single men at the head of vast combinations of private
wealth. This has been peculiarly the case as regards
those controlling the rapidly developed railroad interests.
These modern potentates have declared war, negotiated peace,
reduced courts, legislatures, and sovereign States to an unqualified
obedience to their will, disturbed trade, agitated the
currency, imposed taxes, and, boldly setting both law and
public opinion at defiance, have freely exercised many other
attributes of sovereignty. Neither have the means at disposal
proved at all inadequate to the ends in view. Single men
have controlled hundreds of miles of railway, thousands of
men, tens of millions of revenue, and hundreds of millions
of capital. The strength implied in all this they wielded in
practical independence of the control both of governments and
of individuals; much as petty German despots might have
governed their little principalities a century or two ago. Thus
by degrees almost the whole of the system of internal communication
through the northern half of the United States
has practically been partitioned out among a few individuals,
and, as proximity, or competition on certain debatable
grounds,--- the Belgiums of the system, --- brought the interests
represented by these men into conflict, a series of struggles
have ensued replete with dramatic episodes. No history
of the present time will be complete in which these do not
оссиру much space, and any condensed record of them has,
therefore, much more than a passing value. Not history in
itself, it contains the material of history; yet the thread
of these episodes is so difficult to trace, lying concealed in
such dull volumes of evidence and records of the law, or preserved
only in the knowledge of individuals, that unless it be
found at once it is in danger of being lost forever. The speedy
oblivion which covers up events that, for a time, fasten public
attention and seem big with great results, is indeed one of the
noticeable indications of the times. The practical experience
of this fact has tended greatly to encourage all sorts of violations
both of law and of morals. There seems no longer to
be any Nemesis to dog the evil-doer. Men are to-day in all
mouths infamous from active participation in some great
scandal or fraud, --- some stock operation or gambler's conspiracy,
some gold combination or Erie Railway war, some
_Credit Mobilier_'s contractor's job or Hartford & Erie scandal,
--- and to-morrow a new outrage, in another quarter, works a
sudden condonation of each offence.

Nothing could more fully illustrate the rapidity with which
such episodes as those referred to are forgotten than the complete
oblivion into which the struggle in 1869 for the possession
of the Albany & Susquehanna Railroad has fallen.
This contest, marked by legal scandals almost unparalleled,
and actually resulting in an attempt at armed warfare between
corporations, though not yet finally passed upon by the courts,
is fairly forgotten by the world. It was, however, not without
elements of a permanent interest, though no consecutive
account of it has yet been attempted. The following narrative,
drawn almost exclusively from the sworn evidence and
official records in the case, probably presents the story with
as near an approach to accuracy as is now likely ever to be
arrived at.

The business of transportation by rail naturally divides
itself into the two great elements of through and local traffic.
The Erie Railway was especially constructed with a view to
through traffic, and the New York Central, though originally
consisting in a chain of disconnected local roads, through the
force of circumstances and by a natural process of developmient,
early became one of the great trunk lines of the conti*
nent. The Albany & Susquehanna, on the contrary, was
  designed by its projectors as a purely local road. As such its
  history could never have been a very interesting one, except
  to its projectors and owners. It happened, however, to occupy
  a bit of debatable territory between the two great trunk
  lines just mentioned, and hence derived its importance. New
  England has always been in railroad history a sort of an appanage of the Central Railroad of New York. Both freight
  and passengers passing to and fro between Boston and the
  West naturally took Albany on their way, and the Central
  Road, monopolizing as it did the one natural gap in the mountain ranges which divided the interior basin from the sea,
  looked upon this traffic as its inalienable property. The
  Albany & Susquehanna Railroad started from this eastern
  terminus of the Central, and was intended to open it to the
  Erie at the city of Binghamton, some one hundred and forty
  miles from the point of departure. In the early days of the
  enterprise through traffic was less regarded by railroad managers than it now is, and the future significance of this link in
  their system was hardly realized by either of the great trunk
  lines. The carriage of freight was then but little understood,
  and grades were of far greater importance than they now are.
  Valley roads, it was supposed, might safely ignore the mountain track. This the Albany & Susquehanna certainly was.
  The region through which it passes is very broken, though it
  ranks among the finest of the agricultural districts of New
  York. Starting from that point where the great Alleghany
  range gradually sinks away into the valley of the Mohawk,
  the road skirts the base of the heights of Helderberg, an outlying spur of the Catskills, famous once as the seat of the
  anti-rent troubles, and then, passing among the large rolling
  hills of Southeastern New York, it gradually elimbs the watershed. The route was a difficult one, and the road was costly
  of construction; laid out on the broad-gauge principle, as a
  contemplated feeder of the Erie, it was forced to scale ridge
  after ridge in working its way from one picturesque valley to
  another, through which to find a natural roadway to its destination. The country along the line is of a hilly rather than
  a mountainous character, partaking more of the appearance
  of Vermont than of New Hampshire; timbered lands and
  cultivated fields alternate over the loftiest summits, and there
  is something peculiarly attractive in the primitive nestling
  appearance of the towns and villages. The road thus was
  projected through a difficult and sequestered region, neither
  wealthy nor of varied industries, opening to a new trade
  neither great markets nor a peculiarly active people. It _encountered_, therefore, even more than the average amount of
  those financial tribulations which mark the early history of all
  railroads.

The company was organized in 1852, and the work of construction
was begun in 1853, with one million dollars raised
by individual subscription along the line of the road; further
sums in aid of construction were subsequently received from
the towns likely to be benefited by the line, which, by an act
of special legislation, were authorized to subscribe to its stock;
a loan of one million dollars was likewise obtained from the
city of Albany, upon a pledge of the first-mortgage bonds of
the company. The process of construction was, however,
very slow. The work begun in 1853 was suspended in 1854
on account of the failure of the contractors; it was recommenced
in 1857, and then slowly dragged along to completion,
a very contractors' Golgotha. Eight times did acts extending
to it the financial aid of the State pass the legislature;
but they were _encountered_ by six Executive vetoes, and
from this source the company realized but seven hundred and
fifty thousand dollars. That the scheme was successfully carried
out at all was mainly due to the good pluck and untiring
industry of one man, Joseph H. Ramsey, --- at once the originator,
president, financial agent, legal adviser, and guiding
spirit of the enterprise.

The close of the seventeenth year of corporate life found
all the available means of the company exhausted, and every
one connected with it, except Mr. Ramsey, thoroughly discouraged
and despondent, with the twenty-two last and most difficult
miles of the work yet unfinished. In this emergency
the company once more looked to the State for assistance.
Through the management of Mr. Ramsey, who had himself
in former times more than once assumed the duties of a State
legislator in behalf of the enterprise, the necessary act was
passed. Most unexpectedly it _encountered_ a veto, the sixth
of the series. With an empty treasury, with heavy payments
to contractors and on account of interest already due, and
with other similar payments rapidly maturing, --- with bankruptcy
staring him in the face, and with all sources of supply
apparently exhausted, --- under all these disheartening aspects
of the case Mr. Ramsey did not despair. The company had
in its safe two classes of securities and two only on which the
further necessary loans could possibly be effected. It had a
portion of its own second-mortgage bonds and some nine
thousand shares of its capital stock, on which various instalments
ranging from ten to forty % had been paid by the
original subscribers. This stock and the subscriptions upon
it had subsequently been declared forfeited by a vote of the
Board of Directors, with the consent of the holders, for the
non-payment of the balance of subscriptions. A law of New
York prescribed that no railroad should issue its stock for less
than its par value. This law, however, the courts had held
did not apply to forfeited stock in the treasury of the company.
The difficulty in the case was not in putting the stock
on the market, but in finding a purchaser for it when it got
there; it had no market price; as an investment it ranked
far from high, and, unlike the Erie, it had at this time no
value for "speculative purposes." Under these circumstances
it seemed possible to the directors to make this one of their
two securities available only as a make-weight, --- _a douceur_, it
might be said, to the other. Two loans were effected accordingly,
under a resolution which received the unanimous approval
of the Board of Directors on the 3d of June, 1868.
The first was with Azro Chase, who became the purchaser of
fifty thousand dollars of the second-mortgage bonds at seventy
% of their par value, with the additional right or option
of taking at any time three hundred shares of the forfeited
stock at twenty dollars per share. This loan was negotiated
through one of the directors of the company named Leonard,
acting as its financial agent, and amounted to the sale of
eighty thousand dollars, in the nominal securities of the company,
for the sum of forty-one thousand dollars in cash. Two
hundred shares of the stock, as it afterwards appeared, passed
into the pockets of the director and financial agent as a species
of brokerage commission. The second loan was negotiated by
Mr. Ramsey himself with Mr. David Groesbeck, the head of a
well-known brokers' firm in the city of New York, and formerly
the business associate of Mr. Daniel Drew. This loan
was upon terms somewhat more favorable to the company
than the other, and there were no indications of brokerage in
the case. The company received five hundred and sixty thousand
dollars, and pledged as collateral its second-mortgage
bonds at seventy %, with the privilege of purchasing
them at any time within eighteen months at eighty, and a
similar privilege as regarded twenty-four hundred shares of the
forfeited stock at twenty-five dollars per share. In other
words, if the lenders availed themselves of the option, as they
subsequently did, securities to the nominal value of one million
and forty thousand dollars were sold to them for seven
hundred thousand dollars in cash.) This must certainly be
considered as a very advantageous bargain for the company;
thirty % is a large profit, but it here represented a very
unusual risk. Both of these loans received the unanimous
sanction of the Board of Directors, and that to Groesbeck
played a most important part in the subsequent struggle for
the possession of the road.

With the money thus raised the enterprise was at last carried
through, and, on the 15th of January, 1869, seventeen
years after the organization of the company, the cities of Binghamton
and Albany were brought into direct communication.
Meanwhile those seventeen years of construction had greatly
altered all the conditions of that railroad system of which the
Albany & Susquehanna Railroad was now for the first time
to become an integral part. In 1853 both the Erie and the
Central were but feebly entering on their great careers. The
Erie was just completed to Dunkirk : the Central was not yet
consolidated; the whole receipts of the first were but one
third part of what the completion of Mr. Ramsey's road found
them, while, during the same interval, the receipts of the last
had swollen from less than six millions per annum to considerably
over fifteen. As for the men who managed the great
trunk lines when Mr. Ramsey had completed his work, their
names had never been mentioned in connection with railroads
when he began it. In fact, the whole aspect of the problem
had changed. In 1853 all the roads in the country were
local roads; in 1869 no local road was suffered to exist, unless
the great through roads were satisfied that it could serve
no purpose in their hands; nay, more, unless they were also
satisfied that it could serve no purpose in the hands of their
competitors. When, therefore, the projectors of the Albany
& Susquehanna line had completed it to Binghamton, they
suddenly found themselves involved in all the complications
and controversies of an intricate system. The intended local
road was an element of strength or a source of danger not to
be ignored by the managers of the great trunk lines.

Messrs. Jay Gould and James Fisk, Jr., had at this time
already succeeded in firmly establishing themselves in the
practical ownership of the Erie Railway, Mr. Daniel Drew,
some six months before, had been driven out of its treasurership,
and even Commodore Vanderbilt had been compelled by
fair means and by foul to abandon all idea of controlling its
management. When the Susquehanna Road was completed it
became at once a most important element in the successful
prosecution of the plans of Messrs. Gould and Fisk. It was
so from two points of view, --- either as regarded their competition
with the Central Road for the carriage of the produce
of the West to New England; or, still more important, as regarded
their competition with other agencies for the carriage
of coal to the same region. The anthracite coal deposits of
America lie but a short distance to the south of the Erie Railway.
Disappointed in the hope of successfully competing
with the Central Road for the carriage of the produce of the
West, convinced at last by hard experience that the more of
this business the road undertook to do the more hopelessly
bankrupt it became, the Erie managers had more and more
turned their attention to the business of transporting coal.
In this also they were subject to a very sharp competition,
particularly from the wealthy companies which themselves
owned the coal-beds, and which now proposed to supplement
their business as colliers with that of carriers also. This by
no means met the views of the Erie people. They were now
entering into vast contracts with various coal companies to
haul many hundreds of thousands of tons per annum; they
naturally wished to extend their connection, as by doing so
they accomplished two ends,--- they shut the coal companies
up in their mines, making them dependent on the Erie Railway
for access to their markets, and at the same time they
secured to themselves a monopoly in so far as the consumers
were concerned; they, in fact, placed themselves as an indispensable
medium between producer and consumer. The Albany
& Susquehanna Road might well develop into an independent
and competing line; hence they greatly coveted the
possession of it. By it they would not only secure an access
to Albany, but would forge the link which was to unite the
Erie with a whole network of roads running north and east
from Albany throughout coal-consuming New England.

It is wholly unnecessary to dwell upon the public considerations
which rendered it unadvisable that the adventurers then
representing the Erie Railway should be intrusted with a practical
control over the winter supply of such an article as
anthracite coal. However amiable or otherwise they might
be in their domestic characters, their course had not been
such as to make unprejudiced observers anxious to repose in
them so delicate a duty as that of sole purveyors at any season
of an article of prime necessity. The coal companies
naturally did not look with any favor at a policy which threatened
their lines of communication. Finally Mr. Ramsey, as
the controlling influence in the Albany & Susquehanna management,
neither desired to surrender the independence of his
road, nor, in view of the recent experience of others, did he
impose implicit faith in either the verbal or written assurances
or obligations of the Erie representatives. Possession
was with them considerably more than nine points of the law,
and Mr. Ramsey evinced a marked repugnance to surrender the
property intrusted to his charge into their possession, regardless
of any liberal promises held out as to subsequent beneficial
results, public and private, likely to ensue from his doing so.

The position of Mr. Ramsey in his own board of direction
was not, however, perfectly secure. Certain enmities and
jealousies had, little by little, not unnaturally grown up along
the line of the road, and, at the election of directors in 1868,
a ticket had been chosen partly in the opposition interest.
What these parties represented when they came into the board
it is difficult to say; it may have been a restless feeling of discontent
at the slow progress of the enterprise, or a vague
desire for change; or, perhaps, a personal dislike and mistrust
of Mr. Ramsey. Whatever the cause, the direction at the
time of the completion of the road was divided not unevenly.
This condition of affairs was very unsatisfactory to Mr. Ramsey.
He maintained that at the previous election he and his
friends had been taken by surprise; that no wish for a change
in management really existed in the minds of the bulk of the
stockholders; but, finally, whether it existed or not, he let it
be distinctly understood that he did not intend to belong to a
divided direction, and that at the coming election either he or
his opponents were to go out. The materials for a lively contest
for the control of the company in September, 1869, thus
existed in great abundance and on all sides.

The road was completed in January, and early in June the
Erie manipulators began their preparations to obtain possession
of it, or, as they more graphically would have said, to
"gobble" it. The stock of the road was nominally quoted at
about twenty-five % of its par value; it was rarely
bought or sold, and was supposed to possess little real value,
except as representing the control of the enterprise. It was
almost exclusively in the hands of three classes of owners, ---
the directors and those dwelling along the line of the road,
subscribing municipalities, and certain capitalists who held it
as security for money advanced and expended in construction.
The subscription books of the company had never been closed,
as but two million eight hundred thousand dollars of the four
million dollars of authorized capital had ever been subscribed,
and of the amount of stock which had been subscribed for,
eight hundred thousand dollars had been forfeited in the manmer
already mentioned. Whoever desired to get possession
of the property had, therefore, to obtain the control for a
longer or shorter period, to include the election day, of a
majority of this stock. The Erie party wishing to come in,
and the opposition minority determined not to go out, thus
had natural affinities to each other. But though when united
they controlled a formidable minority of the whole stock, yet
it was by no means the majority, and the Ramsey party was
now thoroughly alive to the danger of the situation. The
plan for the approaching campaign was soon matured. Under
a sudden demand for election purposes the stock, which for
years had been nominally quoted at twenty, rose rapidly in
July to forty and fifty, and even to sixty and sixty-five %. All parties were buying. The issue was, however, to
be decided by stock held by municipalities, and it was to the
control of this that the greatest efforts were devoted. Here
lay the stronghold of the Ramsey party; and here they felt
secure, for the law authorized the town commissioners, who
held this stock as trustees, to sell it only for cash and at its
par value, and forbade them to sell it for less unless specially
authorized to do so by a town vote. This was a point which
it seemed hardly likely to touch. Suddenly, and to their
great dismay, Mr. Ramsey and his friends heard of agents out
among the towns offering the commissioners par for the stock,
provided the offer was accepted at once. Naturally this was
a great temptation to commissioners who represented towns
which grievously felt the weight of railroad loans. These
men were suddenly called upon to accept or reject, on their
own responsibility, an offer which, a few days before, would
have seemed incredible, but the acceptance of which, while it
would relieve the town of debt, would also deprive it of all
voice in the management of the road waited for so long. In
a number of cases the commissioners considered it their duty
to accept the offer, and the control of several hundred shares
was in this way secured. The Ramsey party was thus forced
into the field, and the stock of towns rose to a premium.
This process, however, involved a very considerable outlay
of money and no inconsiderable risk of loss. Buying up a
majority of the stock was altogether too much like paying for
a road. Why should that be obtained at great cost which
could equally well be got for nothing? Stimulated by the
passion which Mr. Fisk has happily described as an inherited
disposition "to rescue things out of somebody else," one Sunday
afternoon, early in August, a party of gentlemen met at
the Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York and arranged a new
plan, involving the certain transfer of the road into their
hands, but avoiding the necessity of further pecuniary outlay.
A negotiation was successfully concluded for the purchase of
four hundred and fifty thousand dollars of the stock of various
towns on the following terms: no money was to pass, but the
bonds of Messrs. Gould and Fisk were given, binding them to
purchase and pay for the stock after the election, provided the
commissioners should at the election vote as the givers of the
bond should direct. The legal effect of such an arrangement
may well have escaped the town commissioners, but Messrs.
Fisk and Gould had not as a rule up to this time been found
deficient in matters of technical nicety. These bonds had no
binding force whatever. It was not a sale for cash, it was
contrary to law and to public policy; it was an arrangement
wholly beyond the powers of the commissioners to make, and
one which the courts would not sustain. The commissioners
who accepted these bonds and who subsequently did vote as
those who gave them dictated, were public officials, as such
their duties were prescribed and were sufficiently simple; they
could sell, and they could vote, but if they sold it was to be
for cash down, and if they voted it was to be on their own
judgments, and not on those of other people. In this case,
indeed, what security had they that, after they had voted the
road into the hands of the Erie managers, the conditions of
the bond in regard to the purchase of the stock would be fulfilled?
As a matter of fact they did vote as they agreed, but
nothing further was ever done to complete the transfer of the
stock.

Events now moved rapidly on both sides. On the 3d of
August the certificates of town stock were presented for transfer.
It was a new question; Mr. Ramsey was away, and the
treasurer hesitated. Finally, all stock sold for cash and paid
for by either side was transferred; but the transfer was denied
where, in the opinion of the treasurer, the transaction was
not completed. It was evident they were pressing the Ramsey
party heavily. It now occurred to Ramsey that the subscription-books
had never been closed, and that twelve thousand
shares of the capital stock of the company were as yet unissued.
On the 5th he took the subscription-book home with
him, held a meeting of a few of his friends, and, among them,
they wrote down their names for nine thousand five hundred
shares of stock. It was fully understood that this subscription
bound those who made it to no immediate payments; ten % was to be paid in at once, and for this Ramsey was to
provide; the remainder would only be called in as should be
ordered by the board of directors whom this very stock would
elect. Meanwhile, if any of the subscribers desired to get rid
of their stock, Ramsey undertook to relieve them of it. That
this subscription, made by directors in secret on the eve of an
election, and with a view of affecting that election, should have
subsequently been held legal is open to criticism; its good
faith even might well have been suspected; but that, on grave
consideration, it should be justifiable is perhaps as severe a
censure as could be passed on the condition of affairs existing
in the community in which it was made. Yet, under the circumstances,
unnecessary and unfortunate as the step afterwards
proved to have been, Mr. Ramsey and his friends were
justified in taking it. It is simply necessary to refer to those
who now sought to obtain control of the Albany & Susquehanna
Railroad. Their position in the community, their standing
in the courts, their financial and fiduciary relations, were
notorious. They had reduced society to a condition in which
any man brought into conflict with them could not but realize
that he had only himself to rely on, that a species of Lynch
law prevailed, and that might and possession alone counted for
anything. The first duty of Mr. Ramsey then, unquestionably,
was to keep the property intrusted to his charge out of
the hands of those men; this every consideration of honor and
of responsibility bound him to do at any cost and by all legal
means, certain that, whatever he might scruple at, his opponents,
once in control, would scruple at nothing. This step
was legal, and, however questionable in many aspects, Mr.
Ramsey and his friends were justified in taking it, provided
they made their subscriptions in good faith to their company,
and held themselves responsible for them. At best, however,
it was an error in judgment. By it Mr. Ramsey sacrificed
much of the strength of his position, which lay in the fact
that he was fighting men who had set the most infamous precedents
ever known for transactions of a not dissimilar character.
As usual in dealing in measures of questionable right
and expediency, one doubtful step soon led to another which
admitted of no doubt.

Ten % on the amount of the subscriptions had at
once to be provided, and that, too, by Ramsey, whose resources
were already strained to the utmost. Again he had recourse
to Groesbeck, and drew on him for $100,000; he had also
subscribed for more stock in Groesbeck's name. The subscription,
involving as it did further possible calls to the full value
of the stock, Groesbeck politely declined; the draft he honored,
receiving as collateral for it a deposit of $150,000 of the
equipment bonds of the Albany & Susquehanna Railroad Co.,
which belonged to the road, and which Mr. Ramsey procured
from the treasurer for the purpose of so pledging them. The
ten % of the subscription was thus paid in, and the nine
thousand five hundred shares were placed on the books of the
company to the credit of the nominal subscribers, each of
whom gave Ramsey a voting proxy for the coming election.
Months afterwards Mr. Groesbeck defended this transaction,
and declared that, under the same circumstances and fighting
the same men, he himself would have gone as far, and further
too, if necessary. The proceeding was, however, none the less
indefensible. The securities which had thus been misapplied
were shortly after, at Groesbeck's own suggestion, returned to
the officials of the company, and their place supplied by collateral
of inferior value; and as for the stock, it was never
voted on, and the issue of it only served to endanger the case
of the Ramsey party.[^/149]

This took place on the 5th of August, but already the usual
storm of judicial orders and injunctions had begun. The stock
of the towns being, so far as possible, secured, the next blow
was directed at the stock reissued and held as collateral. Two
blocks of this were outstanding, --- one in the hands of Chase,
the other in those of Groesbeck. On the application of Messrs.
Gould and Fisk's counsel, an injunction was issued by Mr.
Justice Barnard, of the Supreme Court, forbidding any votes
being cast upon this stock, and ordering its transfer to a receiver
pending judicial investigation; all this upon the ground
that the stock was unlawfully issued. The books were to close
upon the 7th, the order was procured on the 4th. While this
was going on in the city, the Ramsey party was not idle in the
country. On the same day they appeared before Judge Parker
of Owego and commenced a suit, resulting, of course, in the
inevitable injunction, by which all parties were restrained and
enjoined from transferring on the books of the company seven
hundred shares of stock belonging to the town of Oneonta, and
which the Erie party claimed to have purchased. No sooner
did the news of this move arrive in New York, than Mr.
Thomas G. Shearman, a member of the firm of Field, Shearman,
& Co., and one of the most trusted legal advisers of those
now controlling the Erie Railway, was despatched to Owego,
where he succeeded in getting the injunction dissolved. Hitherto
the engagement had been at long range, as it were, but
it now lacked a few days only of the date when transfers
previous to the election were to cease; it was time for close
quarters. Not content with the success of his defensive operations,
the Erie counsellor at once assumed a vigorous offensive.
Two new suits were initiated, --- one to compel the
immediate transfer of that very Oneonta stock which the company
had just previously sought to prevent; and the other, a
more vital thrust still, sought to restrain Ramsey himself from
the further performance of his duties as president of the company.
It is almost unnecessary to say that both the desired
orders were almost immediately obtained. The board of direction
was divided into two hostile camps exactly equal in
strength,--- they stood seven to seven. The suspension of Mr.
Ramsey thus turned the scale and placed the Erie opposition
in the majority. It remained only to call a meeting of the
directors, over which the vice-president, whose sympathy with
the Erie movement was pronounced, would preside, and this
meeting would vote out of office the present treasurer, who
hesitated about the desired transfers, and would replace him
by a suitable successor. Absolute control of the books thus
secured, the election might be regarded as a mere matter of
detail. All the day of that meeting the offices of the company
swarmed with indignant directors and opposing counsel; angry
words passed, loud threats were uttered; the suspended president
was informed that his presence was undesired, and the
assume also the duties of treasurer in so far as these involved
the entering of transfers and the issuing of certificates of stock.
At last a sort of tussle took place over the books, and then the
police were called in, who established an angry truce. All
this took place on the 5th; on the 7th the books were to be
closed.


[^/149]: This and the previous paragraph are republished in the form in which
they originally appeared. Yet it may well be questioned whether even the
modified censure implied upon Mr. Ramsey's proceedings would bear examination.
Ordinary rules cannot always govern exceptional cases. If a man
finds himself involved in an every-day controversy, however angry, he is
very properly expected to confine himself to recognized remedies; if, however,
he is suddenly roused from his sleep by the assault of midnight robbers, he
cannot, if he is a man of courage, be called upon to exercise any nice judgment
as to the use he may make of the weapons nearest at hand; it is a
case of self-preservation. Especially would this be true if his assailants were
notoriously in collusion with the watch. If Ramsey had hesitated, even for
an instant, his friends would have lost courage, and he could never have recovered
himself; under the circumstances it is very difficult to see why he
was not as fully justified in the use of any and every weapon as a man would
be in a struggle for his life. Of course in the one case or the other he would
be amenable to the law for any illegal act. The question is one purely of moral
accountability; legally, a man so circumstanced must act at his own peril. He
may infringe laws, and, if he does, he must be prepared to undergo the penalty
of so doing, but it may yet be his duty to incur that penalty in defence of his
trust.

The control of those books, it was well understood, implied
the control of the road. The presence of James Fisk, Jr.,
and of Jay Gould in the struggle was no mystery, and the
officers of the road could not fail to recall how, only a few
months before, the vault of the Union Pacific Railroad had
been forced, in a vain search for the books of the company,
under cover of a judicial process and at the dictation of these
very men. That the records were not in safety while in the
offices of the corporation was notorious. That night, in the
presence of counsel, and with the knowledge of the treasurer,
they were removed from the building. The law guaranteed to
stockholders access to the books of the corporation; the judicial
abuse of the processes of law had converted this right
into a facility for fraud. Whether those who would now insist
upon the right were likely to avail themselves of that opportunity
was a question in regard to which recent experience in
other quarters might warrant the formation of an opinion. In
any case the books were now surreptitiously removed under
the advice of counsel, and the action of the officials who
assented to this removal was indorsed by public opinion, and,
throughout the subsequent proceedings, was not censured by
the courts.

The next day the opposition wing of the direction met and
organized with the vice-president in the chair. Just as they
were proceeding to business, however, an attorney of the
other wing quietly entered the room and served upon four
of those present a new judicial order, restraining them from
acting as directors of the company, or from interfering with its
affairs. This unexpected move, leaving them without a quorum,
fell like a thunderbolt on the Albany members of the
Erie party, and they precipitately retired from the field and
took the first train to New York in search of counsel and
assistance.

Reaching the Grand Opera House and the offices of the Erie
counsel, the fugitives laid their case before Mr. Shearman.
The quick eye of that gentleman at once took in the whole
situation, and he was not unequal to the emergency. The
president, vice-president, and a majority of the board of direction
were now suspended, and the Albany & Susquehanna
Railroad was suspended with them; every one was enjoined;
there was no one authorized to give an order or to pay out a
dollar; chaos was come again. Recognizing the fact that a
court of equity had done this mischief through the exercise
of one of its powers, Mr. Shearman was inspired with a conviction
that the same court must repair it by the exercise of
another power,--- injunctions had occasioned the dead-lock, a
receivership must dissolve it. A new suit was at once commenced,
the complaint in which set forth the existing condition
of affairs, and prayed for the appointment of receivers
who should operate the road, and so avert the disastrous consequences
otherwise sure to ensue. This paper was drawn up
by Mr. Shearman at his office in the Twenty-third Street Opera
House, on the afternoon of Friday the 6th of August. It was
not ready for signature until the hour of ten o'clock, P. M. The
Grand Opera House is not in the immediate vicinity of any
court of law, nor do judges generally frequent their courtrooms
at late hours on August evenings. The private residence
of Mr. Justice Barnard was on Twenty-first Street, at
least half a mile away, and on the morning of this day the
Justice himself was at the bedside of his dying mother at
Poughkeepsie, seventy-five miles from New York. Telegraphs
from Mr. Fisk had, however, found him there and summoned
him to the city. The order was ready for signature at 10.20
P. M., when it was delivered to a junior partner of the firm
of Field, Shearman, & Co., who thereupon left the Grand Opera
House and, in fifteen minutes, returned with what purported
to be Judge Barnard's signature appended to it. A strange
obscurity hangs over this part of the transaction. It was
never stated throughout the subsequent proceedings where
this order was signed; it was never proved that it had then
been signed by Judge Barnard at all. Diligent inquiry at a
date long subsequent failed to discover any trace of it in the
records of the court; no evidence was ever elicited that Judge
Barnard was in New York at any time during that day. It
was subsequently said to have been signed at the house of
Fisk's mistress; but this strange statement only called forth
a bare denial unaccompanied by any explanation.[^/153] That this
order, whether there signed by him or not, was subsequently
adopted as his own by Judge Barnard admits of no doubt.
Under the most favorable supposition it would appear that
the surprisingly brief period of fifteen minutes had sufficed
to go through all the forms and make all the inquiries necessary
to satisfy the judicial mind in regard to so trifling a
matter as the receivership of some one hundred and fifty miles
of railroad, involving millions of capital. This order appointed
Charles Courter, of whom the judge probably knew absolutely
nothing, and James Fisk, Jr., of whom he undoubtedly knew a
great deal, receivers of the Albany & Susquehanna Railroad
Co. Criticism is wholly unnecessary. The whole proceeding
reflects the highest credit on the energy of all concerned: it
speaks volumes. The law's delay is an ill of which the citizens
of New York, certainly, have no cause to complain, at all
times and under all circumstances.

By half after ten o'clock all was settled, and at eleven the
two receivers, accompanied by a select body-guard of directors,
friends, and lawyers, were on their way by the night train to
take possession of their charge. Their opponents had, however,
already got an inkling of the summary process impending
over them from New York, and, while Mr. Shearman was
busy with the preparation of his order in the Grand Opera
House, other counsel were no less busy in the opposing camp
at Albany preparing a counter-order, appointing another receiver
in their own interest. This, when completed, was duly
submitted to Mr. Justice Peckham, of the Supreme Court
of the Albany district, between nine and ten o'clock of the
same (Friday) evening. The signature of this magistrate was
affixed to it, and a Mr. Pruyn, of Albany, was by him appointed
receiver of the Albany & Susquehanna Railroad Co. It was
close work. Each order took effect when signed, and there
certainly was no delay in their preparation, and even less in
procuring signatures to them. The evidence seemed subsequently
to indicate that the Albany receivership had about
one hour's priority in time; it had, however, one hundred and
fifty miles of distance in its favor, and the great weight which
attaches to possession as an element of success in litigation
has long since passed into a proverb.


[^/153]: It has since been stated, on the authority of Judge Barnard, that he accidentally
met the counsel on his way from the cars to his house, and was asked
by him to sign the order; that he did so, stepping into a neighboring realestate
office for the purpose. The meeting was certainly a singular coincidence,
and the method indicated of transacting judicial business of the first
importance is calculated to excite surprise, if not consternation. The "explanation
" seems, however, to have been considered perfectly satisfactory by
those to whom it was made.

Thus, on Saturday, the 7th of August, everything indicated
a collision of forces. No sooner had Receiver Fisk reached
Albany, and received the reports of his scouts, than he hastened
with his friends to the offices of the company. He
arrived there towards eight o'clock. In spite of this praiseworthy
activity on their part, Messrs. Fisk and Courter, on
proceeding to take possession of the premises, _encountered_ a
somewhat unexpected obstacle in the person of a Mr. Van
Valkenburg, the superintendent of the road, who, upon being
informed of their errand, announced that he was already in
possession under the orders of Receiver Pruyn, and further
intimated that he did not propose to abandon it. A very
amusing and somewhat exciting scene then ensued. The
junior appointee of Mr. Justice Barnard presented his papers
to the superintendent, seated himself on the table, announced
himself as Mr. James Fisk, Jr., of New York, come to take
possession and prepared to do so if it required "millions of
money and an unlimited number of men." He further added
that this was his twenty-sixth raid of the same character, and
that he proposed "to take you fellows"; to all of which Mr.
Van Valkenburg pleasantly replied that he "hoped he would
have a good time doing it." His companions Mr. Fisk introduced
as his "boys," and invited them in to possess themselves.
Quite a lively colloquy ensued, which was not satisfactory
to Mr. Fisk, who from words gradually proceeded to
overt acts, and finally ordered his "boys" to put the other
"boys" out. Unfortunately the preponderance of force was
not on his side. Instead of ejecting mis opponents, he was
summarily ejected himself, and, after being ignominiously and
very roughly hustled down stairs, he found himself in the
street in a very dishevelled condition. Nor did his discomfiture
stop here; no sooner did he reach the pavement
than he was arrested by a fiery little individual, claiming to
be a policeman, and ignominiously marched off to the stationhouse.
As no complaint was preferred he was speedily released,
but probably not until he had discovered that his
arrest, like his ejectment, was the work, not of a policeman,
but of an employee of the company. No sooner was he again
a free man than he returned to the charge. Mr. Pruyn was
now at the offices in person, claiming to be in possession as
receiver, and a crowd of lawyers, officers, and parties in interest
had also assembled there. The heads of the opposing factions
met face to face. No further riotous demonstrations were attempted,
but, pending advices from New York, Mr. Fisk kept
up the semblance of a possession. He evidently bore no illwill
to Mr. Van Valkenburg, on account of the rough treatment
of the morning, as he even went so far as to compliment
that gentleman on his display of energy, and to signify a desire
to extend to him his personal favor. As to Mr. Ramsey,
Mr. Fisk, as a happy solution of existing complications, suggested
that the possession of the road should be decided, not
as of old by a personal contest between the two heads of the
opposing factions, but by the goddess of chance, or whatever
other divinity may preside over the issue of a game of "seven
up"; and, with such interchange of amenities and pleasant
sallies of wit, with now and again the service of some notice
or order of court, and perhaps an injunction or two, the _protégé_
of Barnard beguiled the weary monotony of the day.

The cessation of active hostilities did not last long. The
discomfiture of the morning had been at once telegraphed to
Mr. Shearman, in the recesses of the Grand Opera House, and
that gentleman had forthwith proceeded to discover and apply
the suitable remedies of the law. Recourse was at once had,
or is alleged to have been had, to Judge Barnard, sitting at
special term in the court-house. Again, however, a curious
obscurity hangs over the actual whereabouts of that magistrate.
On this day his mother was still lingering at Poughkeepsie, and
another judge was sitting at special term in the court-house.
In any case a most unusual and indeed wellnigh antiquated writ,
never before granted to meet such an exigency as that which
had now arisen, was at once exhumed and prepared. In the
first place a new and sweeping injunction, purporting to have
been granted by Judge Barnard, was obtained, by virtue of
which Mr. Receiver Pruyn, the sheriff of the county, the
Albany police, and all the railroad employees, were restrained
from any interference with receivers Courter and Fisk. Not
satisfied with this, a writ of assistance[^/156] was likewise ordered
to issue, by which the sheriff, and, if need be, the _posse comitatus_,
were placed at the disposal of Messrs. Fisk and Courter.
This was a sufficiently unusual proceeding, but the service
of the process was so extraordinary that the ordering it was
at once reduced to the commonplace. Now, probably for the
first time on record, both injunction and writ were forwarded
to their destination for service by electric telegraph. That
afternoon officers in Albany actually undertook to serve upon
parties to a suit processes which had been issued in New York
not an hour before, on the strength of affidavits as to facts
which had that day occurred in Albany. In place of making
service with the original, bearing the seal of the court and the
signature of the judge, the very ink of the copies which the
officers had in their hands was not yet dry. Of course such
a service was contemptuously disregarded, nor did the sheriff
presume to insist upon it.


[^/156]: "Writs to the sheriff, to assist a receiver, sequestrator, or other party to a
suit in chancery, to get possession, under a decree of the court, of lands withhelt
from him by another party to the suit. These writs, which issue from
the equity side of the Court of Exchequer, or from any other court of chancery,
are at least as old as the reign of James L., and are still in common use
in England. Ireland, and some of the United States."Quincy s (Mass.) Reports,
p. 396.

It was now afternoon, and it was very evident that nothing
further could be effected this day; both parties, however,
claimed to be in possession, and neither would yield the
ground. Finally a species of truce was arranged to hold good
over the coming Sunday. A representative of each party
was to be left in the offices, and, before nine o'clock of the
coming Monday, no act of hostility, open or covert, in so
far as possession was concerned, was to be attempted by
either side.

The interval of Sunday was passed in active preparation.
While the representatives of the receivers tarried in the deserted
offices, the principals themselves were busy with their
plans of campaign. Mr. Fisk and his friends among the directors
retired to New York to get advice and the originals of the
telegraphed writs; Mr. Pruyn and the Ramsey party stoutly
prepared themselves in Albany for such trials as the morrow
might bring forth. The issue now presented was, in plain
language, one simply of judicial nerve. It was a conflict between
the judiciary of New York City and that of the country.
The system of electing judges by the popular vote had at last
brought forth bitter fruit, and men had been elevated to the
bench who should have ornamented the dock. These selections
did not perhaps extend beyond one or two districts out
of the eight into which the State was divided, but each of the
thirty-three judges who composed those eight courts exercised
throughout the State the extensive and delicate powers of a
chancellor. All were magistrates of co-ordinate powers, and
technically of one court; an order made by one could be dissolved
by another, an officer appointed by this magistrate
could be suspended in the exercise of his duties by that, what
one justice could do the next could undo. Everything under
such a system depended on judicial respect for judicial action;
courtesy and confidence were the essence of it. All these
had, in certain quarters, now long passed away. The judges
of the country had felt bitterly the discredit brought upon
the common bench by the action of more than one judge in the
city; there were among them those who had been deeply mortified
by a contemptuous disregard of their process. Hence a
conflict had become inevitable, and nowhere was it so likely
to arise as out of the litigations originating with the managers
of the Erie Railway. A peculiar discredit had now long attached
to these, and certain names, both on the bench and at
the bar, were always associated with them. There are facts
which are of public notoriety; the community recognizes
them and no justice can ignore them. When, therefore,
James Fisk, Jr., was appointed, as a matter of course, by
Judge Barnard, receiver of a railway, no part of which lay
within a hundred miles of that magistrate's judicial district,
and when this appointment was made on the eve of a contested
election for directors of that railway, and must have
been decisive of the contest, then, at last, a case was presented
which could not be ignored. The conflict was not likely to be
a pleasant one. Recent proceedings in other causes had indicated
with sufficient clearness the lengths to which certain justices
of the first district were not indisposed to go. Neither
the scandal certainly involved, nor the defeat not unlikely to
ensue, were pleasant to contemplate; but the stand must be
made. Circumstances had already designated Judge Peckham,
of Albany, as the magistrate to whom the Ramsey people must
almost necessarily have recourse. The public estimation in
which this gentleman is held was shown by his election, shortly
after the events here narrated took place, as one of the new
Court of Appeals organized under the judiciary clause of the
rejected Constitution of 1869. The scandal which arose out
of the Albany & Susquehanna case most materially contributed
to the adoption of this single clause. It is probable, therefore,
that the action of Judge Peckham on this occasion had a
direct influence on his own future elevation; it certainly
received the public indorsement.

Receiver Fisk might confidently be expected back, well
armed with injunctions and with the original of his writ of assistance
on Monday morning. It was necessary that Receiver
Pruyn should be prepared to meet him. The last New York
suit had enjoined the Albany receiver from any interference
with the New York receivers, and had been accompanied by a
writ of assistance. This was now met in the usual way. A
new Albany suit enjoined the New York receiver from any
interference with Mr. Pruyn, and at the same time an order
was issued by Judge Peckham restraining the sheriffs from
taking any action under the writs of assistance. It was further
sought to punish Mr. Fisk for a contempt of court in
interfering with its receiver on the previous Saturday, but this
the judge held it necessary to send to a referee to take evidence
and report. A temporary injunction was granted, and
Mr. Fisk was ordered to appear and show cause on the 13th
why this should not be made permanent. Such were the legal
complications _encountered_ by Mr. Fisk on his return to the
scene of his labors early on Monday morning. He had left
New York on the boat the evening before, in company with fifteen
friends and advisers, and was fully prepared for vigorous
operations. The condition of affairs did not look propitious.
He was distinctly checkmated at Albany, and the order checkmating
him, and forbidding the sheriffs to interfere to put him
in possession, was already on the express-train which had left
Albany at 8 A. M., and would be due in Binghamton, at
the other end of the coveted road, at three o'clock that after110on.
A party to a conflict, however, who operates by steam,
is at a manifest disadvantage when acting against one who
despatches writs by telegraph. In the present case Mr. Fisk,
baffled at one end of the line, went vigorously to work a hundred
and forty miles away at the other end of it. While the
express-train was toiling along to Binghamton, enjoining as
it went all sheriffs and others from paying any attention to his
writs of assistance, the telegraph was flashing those writs
direct to Binghamton, and commanding that immediate possession
should be given to his representatives. Accordingly
just before two o'clock, and as the afternoon train for Albany
was on the point of leaving Binghamton, the sheriff of Broome
County made his appearance, and, by virtue of a writ of Judge
Barnard's, fresh from the telegraph wires, proceeded to take
possession of all the property of the Albany & Susquehanna
Railroad Co., including the train then standing at the station.
Three locomotives belonging to the same company were also
at Binghamton. These he undertook to seize next; of two
of them he obtained possession, but the agent of the road was
before him with the third; for, just as he was approaching his
prey, writ in hand and borne upon one locomotive, the ingenious
employee switched him off, and, while his own path
suddenly led into space, he saw his prize gently slide down
the grade out of his reach, and there get up the steam necessary
to make good its escape.

The Barnard receivers were thus fairly installed in possession
of the Binghamton end of the road, of the point where
it connected with the Erie. An assistant superintendent of
the Erie Railway was at once appointed superintendent of the
Albany & Susquehanna, and a conductor of the same road
was ordered to take out the regular train to Albany, which
was still standing at the platform where it was seized. Matters
were evidently approaching a crisis. Different sets of
receivers were operating the two ends of the road, and two
sheriffs, bearing conflicting processes, were rapidly approaching
each other on trains drawn by the locomotives and directed
by the officers of the hostile factions. This condition of affairs
was telegraphed to the Ramsey train at Harpersville,
twenty-five miles from Binghamton, and, after some consideration,
it was determined to proceed no farther. Meanwhile
the news of the Binghamton proceedings caused Superintendent
Van Valkenburg to decide on vigorous measures. In
the first place he proceeded to clear the offices of all hostile
influences. Mr. Fisk had not that day been allowed within
the premises. Repeatedly, in company with the sheriff and
others, had he presented himself and energetically demanded
admission. It was of no avail. It was different with Mr.
Courter, his fellow-receiver; he had been treated with a degree
of courtesy, and indeed had been permitted to sustain
the character of a nominal receiver within the offices. This
gentleman was, however, now notified by Mr. Van Valkenburg
that the farce of a double possession was to terminate then
and there. On Saturday, in the little unpleasantness with
Mr. Fisk, Van Valkenburg had given some indications that he
was a man of few words and decided action. The hint had
not been thrown away. Mr. Courter, after a formal resistance
just sufficient to establish the fact of forcible ejectment, withdrew
from the premises, and the Barnard receivers abandoned
every pretence of actual possession of the Albany end of the
line. Van Valkenburg's next move was to telegraph an order
over the road, stopping every train where it then was; all
movement was thus brought to a stand. An extra train, carrying
a hundred and fifty men from the workshops, under
command of the master mechanic, was then sent up the road.
to be ready for any emergency. Having thus cleared everything
away for action, the next move of the other side was in
order.

The representatives of this other side were meanwhile advancing
from the opposite direction; upon the train were the
sheriff of Broome County, the Erie superintendent of the road,
and some twenty men. As they moved along, the orders
of Judge Barnard were served at each way station, the old
officials of the road were displaced, and Erie men were substituted
for them. So eager, indeed, was the sheriff in the discharge
of his duties, under the electro-writ of assistance, that
he not only served an order, the illegal character of which he
must have more than suspected, throughout his own county,
but he continued to do so throughout the adjacent county,
and, indeed, seemed not indisposed to extend his bailiwick to
Albany. At Afton, about thirty miles from Binghamton, a
despatch was received from Mr. Van Valkenburg, notifying
the party that any farther advance would be at its own peril.
The Albany people were then lying at Bainbridge, six miles
farther down the track. After some hesitation, which involved
a great deal of rapid telegraphing and no inconsiderable delay,
positive orders for an advance came to the Erie party, followed
shortly after by reinforcements. It was now deep in the
night, but the train at last was started, and moved slowly and
cautiously towards Bainbridge. The Albany party was prepared
to receive it. They lay on a siding, with a patent
frog --- a little machine made to slide trains on to the rails,
but equally calculated to slide them off --- attached at a convenient
point to the main track. In total ignorance of this
bit of strategy, the Erie people felt their way along, when, just
as Bainbridge, to their very great relief, seemed safely reached,
their locomotive gently and suddenly glided off the track, and
their train was brought to a stand-still. The instant this took
place the Albany train moved up the siding, passed triumphantly
by its disabled opponents and on to the main track
above them, where it took its position in their rear, effectually
cutting off all retreat. As the Erie party tumbled out of their
train, they were met by Mr. Smith, one of the counsel of their
opponents, who glanced at the process under which they were
acting, and at once pronounced it worthless. There was no
alternative; they had fallen into a trap, unconditional surrender
was all that remained. This was accordingly submitted
to, and Sheriff Browne of Broome County, and all his _posse
comitatus_, were helped off their train and duly served with the
order of Judge Peckham, restraining them from doing or attempting
anything in aid of the receivers appointed by Judge
Barnard.

Having disposed of this little party by capture, and it being
now broad day, the Ramsey commander decided vigorously to
follow up his advantage, steaming up the road towards Binghamton.
On the way he displaced the recently appointed
Fisk men, and replaced the ejected Ramsey men in charge
of the various stations. Everything proceeded well until the
train approached the long tunnel, near Binghamton. This
was the battle-ground chosen by the Erie party. Here, close
to their base of operations, and near their supplies, they had
massed their reserves, after the total and ignominious capture
of their advance guard.

The tunnel is some twenty-two hundred feet in length, and
is about fifteen miles from Binghamton. It marks the last
summit the road crosses in going west, and, on either side, is
approached by a heavy ascending grade and round a sharp
curve. The Albany party arrived at this point at about ten
o'clock, and here halted. On the other side of the hill, trains
were bringing up workmen from the Erie shops, under the
officers of the Erie road, until Mr. Fisk's threat in regard to
'any number of men " seemed tolerably certain to be verified.
It was a motley collection, the control of which must have
considerably puzzled the general superintendent of the Erie
Railway, who found himself in command. A more unwieldy
body could not well have been got together. The men were
wholly unarmed, except, perhaps, with sticks, which one party
was detailed to cut in the neighboring woods; they had been
hastily summoned from the shops, and were ignorant as children
of the crazy errand they were about, nor had they the
slightest enmity towards those opposite to whom they stood in
ludicrous array. This, however, was not the case with the
Susquehanna people. They were now thoroughly stirred up
and ready for anything. Most of them had for years been in
the employ of the road, and many were personally attached to
Mr. Ramsey; they regarded the effort to dispossess him as
aimed also at themselves. They were, too, flushed with the
success at Bainbridge, and possessed with a strong _esprit de
corps_. Such being the opposing elements, they lay waiting
for peremptory orders, which in any case had to come from
Albany, for there both Fisk and Van Valkenburg kept their
head-quarters. From time to time reinforcements came up,
until by seven o'clock the Erie party was raised to an unwieldy
mob of some eight hundred men, while their opponents
numbered hardly less than four hundred and fifty. The Erie
people now decided to try an advance, and accordingly a train
well loaded with combatants was set in motion. It moved
slowly through the tunnel and emerged safely from the eastern
end, merely having to replace a single rail. This done,
the advance was continued. Meanwhile the Albany people
were fully notified of the impending danger. Accordingly,
when the Erie people had replaced the rail and started, they
started too, and thus the first intimation the raiders had of
danger was the discovery, on rounding the sharp curve, of an
approaching locomotive, angrily puffing up the grade, and
apparently bent on mischief. This was more than they were
prepared for. Their whistle at once signalled danger, which
the Albany locomotive replied to by signalling to them to get
out of the way. In vain the Erie conductor jumped off his
train and gesticulated like a madman; in vain the Erie engineer
tried to back out of the way; the curve was here so
sharp and the incline up which it was necessary to back in
order to return into the tunnel was so great, that it was instantly
evident, not only that the Albany people wanted a
collision, but that their wish was to be gratified. Though the
Erie engine could not reverse, it had stopped, and the heavy
grade kept down the speed of the Albany train, so that the
collision rather indicated an _animus_ than inflicted an injury;
nevertheless, in a moment the two locomotives came together
with a sharp shock. The damage done was not great; guards
and cow-catchers were swept away, head-lights were broken,
and the attacking locomotive was roughly thrown from the
track; but the collision of engines was the signal for a collision
of men. Before the trains had met they were emptied of their
loads. Such a system of opposition was something on which
the Erie people had not counted, and when, simultaneously
with the collision, the Albany men rushed upon them with
loud shouts, they were at once completely demoralized, and
broke into a precipitate flight. Their locomotive, with broken
lights and a pistol-bullet through its cab, vigorously reversed,
until it had reversed itself out of the _mêlée_ and back into the
tunnel, while they themselves took to their heels and scampered
back towards Binghamton. A few remained on board
the train, a few stumbled back through the darkness of the
tunnel, but the greater part, to whom their terror perhaps
lent wings, scaled the mountain like a sand-hill in their flight.

Victory had again rested on the Albany banners; the Ramsey
star was in the decided ascendant. While one party of the
Albany men followed up the disorganized enemy, others busied
themselves in getting the locomotive on the track. This
was soon done, and then they, in their turn, locomotive and
all, advanced through the tunnel to complete the rout of Erie.
The last-named party had, however, rallied a little in the
breathing-time afforded them, and were now at least equal to
the task of making a very considerable noise. This, it is true,
was not much, but in the growing darkness it was enough.
In fact it might be said that one party was afraid to go forward,
and the other did not dare to attack. The element of
the ludicrous was becoming very pronounced, notwithstanding
the earnestness of the combatants. Thus, as the shades
of night deepened, they stood apart and defied each other
with loud shouts and excessive profanity. A few conflicts
of the more daring, a few scattering pistol-shots, a few wounds,
none of them serious, told the whole story. Yet it was a riot,
and a shockingly lawless one; nay, more, it was an alarming
one. It was not a sudden fight between ignorant and angry
mobs; it was the attempt of two great corporations to levy
war on each other with organized force. How far it might
have gone cannot be said, for, in the midst of the tumult, the
drums of the Forty-fourth Regiment of State Militia were
heard approaching, and at this not unwelcome sound the combatants
desisted. The Erie people held possession of the field.
The Albany party sullenly withdrew, locomotive and all,
through the tunnel, which they blocked up with a freightcar,
and then, after breaking down a trestle-work or two, with
a view of preventing another attack, they retired to Harpersville,
where they established themselves for the night.

Meanwhile the whole State was in an uproar over the scandal
of these lawless acts. All along the line of the road, and
indeed almost everywhere, the feeling was strongly in sympathy
with Mr. Ramsey. It could not well be otherwise; without
knowing anything of the circumstances of the particular
case, a strong presumption was now inevitable wherever the
Erie management made its appearance in any complication.
At Albany the public sentiment was peculiarly strong; meetings
were held, a perfect ovation greeted the arrival of the
runaway locomotive from Binghamton and the captured Erie
train; crowds collected round the station, and were addressed
from the cars by city demagogues on their way "to the front."
At last, also, the point was reached at which, if the authorities
did not interfere, the people would organize and take matters
into their own hands. The militia had already been called
upon by the civil authorities of Broome County and had responded
to the call, and now Governor Hoffman was recalled
from his summer sojourning-place by telegraph, and reached
Albany at almost the very time that the Forty-fourth Regiment
arrived at the scene of riot. He at once took decisive
measures. Orders were telegraphed to the sheriffs along the
line of the road, directing them, in all cases of doubt, to treat
any party in actual possession under a judicial order as being
in rightful possession. The military were to be called upon
only in case of extreme emergency, but, if the disorders continued,
the whole district was to be placed under martial
law.

In spite of these new developments, the Erie party was
neither discouraged nor idle. The papers of Tuesday contained
a long letter from Mr. James Fisk, Jr., setting forth at
great length the magnitude of the public interests for which he
claimed to be contending. The literary shortcomings of this
production were excused on the ground of "quick, sharp work
on a stamping ground new to me." Not content with this bid
for moral support, on the evening of Tuesday, when the offices
of the company would naturally have been deserted, Fisk and
Courter made another effort to obtain possession of them.
Armed with an order of Judge Barnard's, staying all proceedings
under Judge Peckham's writ of Monday, and further fortified
with an additional writ of assistance, the brother receivers
made their appearance in a carriage accompanied by the sheriff.
Van Valkenburg was, however, on the ground, and, for a
moment or two, things had an unpleasant look; so unpleasant,
indeed, that Mr. Fisk now changed his tactics. Instead of
bullying he attempted bribing; all the braggart confidence
of Saturday was gone, and his demeanor was chiefly marked
by an excessive care for his personal safety. As for the sheriff,
the indications of violence were sufficiently pronounced to
induce him to think it inexpedient to proceed further. Probably
they would have gone away empty-handed, had not a
new judicial power just then stepped into the arena. This
was Mr. Justice Clute, of the Albany County Court, who
issued his order directing the arrest of the Barnard receivers
for conspiring to take possession of the Albany & Susquehanna
Railroad by force of arms. In obedience to this order the two
indignant receivers were at once taken to Judge Clute's office,
whence they were not released until they gave bail for their
appearance next morning. The _coup de main_ was a failure ;
but Mr. Fisk relieved his feelings by graphically describing
the attempts which had been made to assassinate him.
The next morning Judge Peckham began the day, not

exactly by setting aside his brother Barnard's recent orders,
but, more courteously, by fixing a day on which cause should
be shown why they should not be vacated, and, meanwhile,
granting a temporary stay of all proceedings under them.
The judicial equilibrium was thus restored. At last Governor
Hoffman put a final stop to the judicial farce by notifying the
sheriff of Albany that he was included in the directions of the
previous day. The Ramsey party, being in actual possession
at Albany under a judicial order, forthwith applied to the
police for protection, which was immediately granted them.
Meanwhile, Governor Hoffman received information of the
tunnel conflict. He at once notified the counsel that such
proceedings must stop, and that some agreement must be
arrived at. In due time the counsel notified the Governor,
in reply, that they were utterly unable to agree on anything.
His Excellency thereupon very emphatically and very properly
replied that he neither knew nor cared anything for their complications,
but he did propose to preserve the public peace.
If those interested could not agree on some other course, it
only remained for him to declare the whole district in a state
of insurrection, and to operate the road as a military one.
This declaration produced a document, signed by all the receivers,
requesting his Excellency, as a species of nondescript
superintendent, mutually agreed upon, to take possession of
and operate the road. This very anomalous trust was accepted
by Governor Hoffman, who issued a _quasi_ military
order, detailing Inspector-General McQuade as his deputy
superintendent, and directing him to take possession. This
was certainly a fitting climax to all that had gone before. A
receiver is an officer of the court. His possession is the possession
of the court. The courts in this case were fighting
over the control of a railroad, and were forced to ask the
Executive to hold the bone of contention while the judiciary
"had it out" amongst themselves. Thus the Executive, in
the utter break-down of the law, had to accept a trust which
did not belong to it, and proceed to perform duties which it
had no right to perform, under an authority conferred by certain
persons who had no such authority to confer. And all
this because a man was selected in cancus and elected at the
polls a judge in the first judicial district of New York, who
fairly represented the moral and intellectual level of the majority
of the voters who had elevated him into infamy. It was
no accident; there was no element of chance in the case; it
was the working of a system which produced a logical and
natural result.

Though the possession of the road was thus disposed of, certain
little outstanding accounts remained to be adjusted. The
vacating of Judge Peckham's orders by Judge Barnard, and
the staying of proceedings under Judge Barnard's orders by
Judge Peckham, were matters of too common occurrence to
call for notice. The interference of Judge Clute, however, a
mere county judge, was something "most tolerable and not to
be endured." And now for the first time in these proceedings
Judge Barnard appeared upon the stage as something more
than a name. The funeral of his mother had taken place at
Poughkeepsie on the previous day; on that day, also, orders
had been forthcoming from him in these Susquehanna suits,
purporting to be granted on the behest of Mr. Shearman, between
11 A. M. and 1 P. M., at special term at the courthouse
in New York City. The minutes of the court-house show
that the special term at the court-house in New York City was
held on this day by another magistrate. Upon the morning of
the 11th, however, he at length appeared in proper person, and,
after obtaining from him the usual order, setting aside Judge
Peckham's action of the day before, Mr. David Dudley Field,
of counsel for the Erie Railway, read to the court the return
of the sheriff, setting forth the resistance he had _encountered_
on the previous afternoon in his attempt on the Susquehanna
offices. Upon his motion the court ordered a peremptory writ,
not bailable, to issue, commanding the sheriff to arrest Messrs.
Pruyn, Ramsey, and Van Valkenburg, and to produce their
bodies in court without delay. Under this process these gentlemen
were arrested that afternoon, while in the Executive
Chamber, and were held in duress awaiting conveyance to
New York. Of course they none of them, at this time, seriously
contemplated any such journey. Recourse was again
had to Judge Clute, and the non-bailable prisoners were carried
before that magistrate on a _habeas corpus_. The subject
was taken under consideration by him until next morning.
The opponents of Mr. Fisk had shown themselves not inapt
scholars, and it naturally occurred to them that processes for
contempt might be made to apply to him as well as to themselves.
The same thought suggested itself to Mr. Fisk, as
soon as he found time to relax from the efforts incident to
"quick, sharp work on a stamping ground new to him." He
had once before fled to Jersey City, pursued by Barnard; he
now incontinently retired to New York, terrified by Peckham.
In fact, he abandoned his new "stamping ground" with great
precipitation. Flying on board his own steamer, which was
lying in the stream ready to serve either as an ark of refuge
or a stronghold for prisoners, he was conveyed at once to New
York, where he secured himself in the recesses of Castle
Erie.

The next morning Judge Clute incontinently discharged the
prisoners held under Judge Barnard's writ. It is almost
unnecessary to say that his action was apparently in disregard
of law; these proceedings throughout were open to this criticism.
It was perfectly proper for Judge Clute to issue his writ
of _habeas corpus_; when it came, however, to releasing prisoners
held by a sheriff on a writ issued for contempt from a
court superior to his own, the action of his Honor was, perhaps,
more spirited than correct in practice. The prisoners,
however, were released, and it only remained for the sheriff to
make a return of the facts by mail to Judge Barnard. The
matter was then brought once more before that magistrate,
this time by Mr. Shearman. The colloquy that then took
place was characteristic and well calculated to fill with terror
the hearts of Peckham and Clute, no less than of Pruyn and
Ramsey. The counsel began with a comparison. Judge Peckham,
it appeared, had signed certain of his orders at his office;
Judge Barnard, it will be remembered, was supposed to have
signed his somewhere in the immediate neighborhood of a
theatre. Bearing these facts in mind, one cannot but appreciate
the delicate sense of honor implied in the following opening
remark of the counsel: "Unlike our opponents, who invite
the judge to their private office, and from which he issues
his orders as if from the court, we have never sought to consult
your Honor in private, and whatever we have asked has
been asked openly in court, and in accordance with our firm
conviction of our legal rights." The peculiarly elevated tone
of Judge Barnard's court being thus established, the colloquy
proceeded as follows:---

_Judge Barnard_. I have been looking into this matter with
some degree of care, and am of opinion that J. H. Clute, signing
himself as county judge of Albany County, entertained
jurisdiction of this matter as a criminal contempt, well knowing
that it was a civil contempt. I am not quite sure but he
should be brought before me to be punished for contempt.

_Mr. Shearman_. I intend to follow these men as I have
followed others. Four months ago we were in pursuit of eertain
parties, and they were finally overtaken as their coat-tails
were disappearing behind a safe. I shall follow these men,
if it is necessary and possible, to the end of time.

_Judge Barnard_. I have some years to sit on this bench,
and would as soon devote them to this as to anything else.

_Mr. Shearman_. I am a young man also, having perhaps
forty years at my disposal, and I am willing to devote them all
to the pursuit of these men.

The first step in this forty years of persistent strife was
thereupon at once taken by directing the sheriff to make a
more detailed return. The individuals in question had, however,
already fled the State, and Judge Barnard does not seem
finally to have made up his mind to try conclusions with
Judge Clute. Meanwhile the friends of the fugitives began to
think that these proceedings had exceeded the limits of a jest.
To fly the State was an ignominious thing; it seemed to imply
a confession of wrong-doing; it could only be justified by the
uncertainty which existed in regard to the limits of judicial
power in cases of contempt, and especially of the exercise of
that power by Barnard himself. He had indicated his _animus_
by his remarks in court. Resort was had to negotiation. One
of the Ramsey counsel went to New York and threw himself in
Barnard's way. The Judge assured him that there was no vindictiveness
in his mind, and this interview led finally to some
distinct understanding, reassured by which the fugitives one
by one came back and presented themselves in court. After
this the matter took the usual course. A reference was ordered,
a mass of evidence was taken, the case dragged its slow length
along, bail was reduced, a multiplicity of orders were issued,
the wrath of Barnard gradually subsided, and, at last, the battle
of the judges died away in a faint rumble of evidence, affidavits,
explanations, and orders, and then was heard of no more.

One further order, and one only, was made at about this
time, to which subsequent events lent a deep consequence.
The Erie party had been completely foiled in its efforts to get
possession of the much-coveted books. Now and again they
would obtain some clew which led them to suspect their presence
somewhere, but when they were sought they were gone.
Agents went out of the State hunting for them, parties were
examined in the State concerning them; a strange ignorance
apparently existed as to their whereabouts. They seemed
ubiquitous; at one time in Albany, at another in Pittsfield,
and then suddenly in Troy; but always in the undisturbed
possession of some friend of Mr. Ramsey. The Erie party
was, in their absence, wholly unable to estimate its own relative
strength as compared with that of its opponents. It was
known, however, that a portion of the forfeited stock had been
reissued, and now stood in the names of Leonard, Groesbeck,
and others. Leonard was a director, and in negotiating the
sale for the company of certain of its second mortgage bonds
and stock had reserved to himself a portion of the stock as a
species of brokerage commission. Mr. Leonard, however, was
one of the directors in close sympathy and alliance with the
Erie management, and, in regard to the stock reissued and
standing in his name, for which in reality no consideration
had been paid to the company, it seemed unnecessary to institute
any proceedings. Not so as regarded that issued to
Groesbeck and paid for by him. The reissue of this last stock
was pronounced flagrantly illegal and void, and Judge Barnard
was accordingly petitioned to appoint a receiver for it. The
order was inmediately granted, and Mr. William J. A. Fuller,
an individual who had once been a clerk in Mr. Field's office,
was named receiver, and directed to take immediate possession
of the property. Armed with this order, and accompanied by
a sheriff's officer, the new receiver proceeded at once to Mr.
Groesbeck's office and demanded his scrip. Upon Mr. Groesbeck's
demurring somewhat at being deprived of his property
in this summary way, Receiver Fuller proceeded to explain to
him the mysterious terrors of a writ of assistance, which
almost unknown process he darkly intimated he had somewhere
at hand. Mr. Groesbeck was tolerably familiar from
long experience with all the usual judicial processes which are
auxiliary to New York financial combinations, but writs of assistance
were implements strange to him. The element of the
unknown seems to have produced the desired effect, and Mr.
Groesbeck delivered to Mr. Fuller certificates for nine hundred
shares of stock. Under the same authority this gentleman
further collected other certificates representing sixteen hundred
additional shares. His duty was simply, at the most,
to hold these shares pending the result of litigation as to the
legality of their issue; he subsequently, as will be seen, took
what may be called very enlarged views of these duties. Both
parties had now gathered up their strength for the election
which was to take place on the 7th of September.

It was provided in the by-laws of the company that the polls
should be opened at twelve o'clock on the day of election, and
should continue open for one hour; no transfers of shares were
to take place during the thirty days next preceding the election;
three inspectors were provided for, to be chosen each
year by the stockholders; it was their duty to conduct the
election; they were to be provided by the secretary with a
list of stockholders entitled to vote, and to them also upon
that day the transfer book was to be submitted. To this state
of the law and the facts the two parties prepared to conform
their plans. It was in the first place incumbent on the Ramsey
party to restore the books to the offices of the company.
This was done very secretly on the night preceding the election.
A certain fictitious consequence was sought to be
attached to the way in which this was done, owing to the fact
that, when the messengers arrived with the books, instead
of finding everything quiet and deserted as they had hoped,
they discovered a large crowd gathered in front of the offices
watching a conflagration across the river. The nature of their
business was thus sure to be discovered. This was just what
they wished to avoid. After a moment's reflection it was decided
to drive with the books to the rear of the building and
put them in through a window. A basket and cord were
found, the books were hauled up to the second-story window
by the secretary, and by him secured in the safe of the company.
Had the books, under the circumstances, been carried
in through the front door, an officer armed with a warrant,
and accompanied, if need be, by pick-locks and blacksmiths,
would, in all probability, have been after them before morning.
As it was, their return was a secret until it ceased to be
of importance. Many unjustifiable features were assigned to
the proceeding by the Fisk counsel; the one thoroughly unjustifiable
one in their eyes was probably its success. It was
never denied that the secretary of the company had, after the
removal of the books and while they were secreted, made
many entries in them. These, however, were all of transactions
concluded prior to the day when the books were to be
closed, and included all of those transactions, whether favoring
Ramsey or Fisk. Though much was hinted in regard to
these entries, during the searching investigation they were
subjected to in the subsequent trial, no instance of abuse of
trust was even specifically alleged, much less proved. Nor
indeed is it probable in itself that any such improper entries
were made, as those who made them must at the time have
known that they were unnecessary so far as securing a majority
of the stock was concerned.

The aspect of affairs was not, on the whole, propitious to
the Erie party as the day of election drew near. Their opponents
held the books, which forced them to act very much
in the dark, and the inspectors of election were understood to
incline to the Ramsey interest. That a majority of the stock
also inclined to it was a matter of less moment. The situation
was full of difficulty; but the men called upon to meet
it were full of resource. Their preliminary step was naturally
to lay in a sufficient supply of judicial orders. The regular
inspectors must, in the first place, be got out of the way. It
was ascertained that they were not stockholders; the by-laws
required that the inspectors should be chosen from among the
stockholders. The Fisk-Gould counsel at once applied to
Judge Clerke, a colleague of Judge Barnard's, in the First
District, and that magistrate granted, as a matter of course,
an _ex parte_ order, restraining the inspectors from acting as
such. Having obtained this process from Judge Clerke, and
filed it away for use at the proper moment, the counsel next
applied to Judge Barnard. They quietly commenced a suit in
the name of the Albany & Susquehanna Railroad Co. against
Messrs. Ramsey, Pruyn, Phelps, and Smith, the president,
receiver, secretary, and leading counsel of the company, to
recover damages for the abstraction of its books. On this
complaint they obtained from Judge Barnard, on the evening
of the day preceding the election, an order of arrest against
the defendants, with bail fixed at $25,000. This, be it remembered,
was a judicial proceeding in New York, and not in
Constantinople. Thus panoplied in orders, all parties repaired
on the 6th to Albany. Mr. David Dudley Field came from
the pleasant shades of his summer retreat among the hills
of Berkshire, and Mr. Shearman, his associate in the practice
of the law, had, for the nonce, quitted his offices in the Grand
Opera House, in order himself to be at the right hand of his
chief in conducting those delicate proceedings so skilfully and
secretly planned in New York. The former gentleman was
doubtless actuated only by a high sense of his professional
duty to his clients, but Mr. Shearman may have been braced
for the approaching crisis by the fell purpose he had recently
avowed of pursuing even for forty years the miscreants who
had failed properly to respect the orders of the distinguished
magistrate with whom his own relations were such models
of propriety. Having arrived in Albany, the last-named gentleman
repaired at once to the capitol, where he carefully
informed himself as to the details of the election. This done, a
general conference was held at the Delavan House, and the
plan of operations was matured. The first object was to
secure the organization of the meeting; that once done,
arrangements of a satisfactory nature had been made to hold
it. The trap was to be sprung just before the hour appointed
for the election, when the regular inspectors were to be enjoined
by the service upon them of Judge Clerke's _ex parte_
order. The whole regular machinery being thus dislocated, a
preliminary organization was to be effected, three new and
thoroughly sound inspectors were to be chosen, which would
insure the control of the election and the subsequent possession
of the Susquehanna Railway. Every detail was arranged,
every person who was to play a part was designated and carefully
taught his _rôle_. Such was the extreme caution used
that Mr. Shearman himself wrote out the appropriate resolutions,
and indorsed upon them the order in which, and the
very second at which, they were to be offered; while Mr.
David Dudley Field personally handed certain of them to the
leading performers, with further verbal instruction. Early the
next morning there took place one of the most remarkable
comparisons of watches on record. A special messenger visited
the Dudley Observatory, and obtained the exact time,
which was by him communicated to every active performer in
the approaching farce; or, rather, to all except the vulgar
majority, to whom time was of no consequence, they being
hired by the day, and constituting the fierce democracy of the
occasion. These gentlemen arrived by the morning train from
New York; they were a very singular party, such as is more
frequently seen in the neighborhood of the riotous election
precincts of New York City than in the offices of respectable
corporations. A breakfast was negotiated for them by an
employee of the Fall River line of steamers, which constituted
"Admiral" Fisk's naval command, at the saloon in the station;
and there they stood and fed at the counter, as rough a
set of patriots as ever stuffed a ballot or hit from the shoulder.
Some of them had coats, and some had not; their clothes were
in various stages of dilapidation, as also were their countenances;
open shirts disclosed muscular breasts, and rolled-up
trousers stockingless feet; one man saved himself the trouble
of rolling up both legs of his trousers by having only one;
they emphatically belonged to that class technically known as
"roughs," a class subsequently defined by a witness as "men
with scarred faces and noses, and black eyes.' Under the
circumstances it was little to be wondered at, that, while they
indulged in a "square meal," the keeper of the saloon gave
directions to have his silver counted. Pending the feeding
of the democracy, their proxies were in course of preparation;
at last all was ready, and between eleven and twelve o'clock
they were marched up fifty strong to the offices of the company.

Everywhere things proceeded exactly according to plan. On
his way in a carriage to the corporation offices, Mr. Shearman
happened to see the injunction of Judge Clerke served on two
of the three inspectors as they were on their way to the meeting.
This settled two points; the injunction was a surprise;
and the regular inspectors were disposed of. Judge Barnard's
more important order was meanwhile sent to the sheriff, and
the messenger was specially instructed by Mr. Shearman himself
to hand it to him with this Roman injunction, "Sheriff,
do your duty!" This instruction was given at nine o'clock,
but, curiously enough, the official had to consult his lawyer
about the service of the process, and this lawyer happened to be
one of Mr. Fisk's numerous legal advisers; with that gentleman
he remained in counsel until half past eleven o'clock, when at
last he was advised to make his arrests at once. By this time
all the parties were collected at the offices of the company.
It might fairly be called a mixed society. Mr. Van Valkenburg
had tendered to the Governor's receivers a guard of men
from the shops of the road, but these had been refused, and a
large force of Albany police were on duty in the building.
Some thirty of the employees of the company were on hand
against an emergency, but under positive orders not to enter
the offices until sent for. Up stairs was a large array of stockholders,
directors, real and contingent, a few receivers, and a
score or two of counsel. Then came the New York importation
of ruffians, who were divided into squads under the
command of divers officials of the Fall River boats, the Erie
Railway and the Grand Opera House; thus marshalled, and
each man proxy in hand, they were marched into the room and
formed in line at one end of it. Besides these there was present
a choice collection of Albanians of somewhat similar character,
cither neutrals or inclined to Mr. Ramsey. How they
got there did not appear, but if the instructions to the police
to allow no one but holders of certificates of stock to pass up
stairs were enforced that day, these certificates were certainly
held by a great many strange characters. The Erie party,
prominent among whom were Messrs. David Dudley Field,
Thomas G. Shearman, and James Fisk, Jr., took possession
of the directors' room, which their assortment of "New York
stockholders" wellnigh filled; in the adjoining room were
Messrs. Ramsey, Pruyn, and their friends and advisers.

Exactly at fifteen minutes before twelve o'clock, by observatory
time, one Colonel North, to whom that _rôle_ in the Erie
parts had been assigned, moved the organization of the meeting.
No opposition was _encountered_, and the gentleman cast
for the part of chairman was duly installed. The resolve indorsed
"No. 1, Immediate," was then recited by Colonel North,
Mr. Shearman standing at his side watch in hand, and the old
inspectors were voted out of office and the new ones in. The
officers thus elected at once retired to the treasurer's room,
where the poll was to be held, whither they were immediately
followed by Mr. Shearman, still watch in hand; having satisfied
himself that all was in readiness there, this master of ceremonies
immediately returned to the side of Colonel North and
resumed his comparison of timepieces. At last he said: "It
is now one minute of twelve; keep your watch open and be
sure that you offer these resolutions at a little after twelve,
and not before ; and, in order to make sure, wait a few seconds
after twelve, but not more than fifteen seconds." With this
parting injunction he left the Colonel to his own devices, and
"at thirty seconds of twelve" returned to the inspectors'
room, just in time to find an injunction served on those officials.
It was issued on the complaint of David Groesbeck, and
enjoined an election unless the stock held by him was first
voted on. Now, at last, was developed the entire significance
of the _ex parte_ order under which Mr. William J. A. Fuller was
made receiver of this stock. There were twenty-five hundred
shares of it; Mr. Groesbeck had paid for several hundred of
them; he was at that very moment in the next room; he was
on every ground bitterly opposed to the Erie direction, and
to the parody of an election then in process; Mr. William J. A.
Fuller was the receiver of the stock, and it was to this receiver,
now conveniently standing at his elbow, that Mr. Shearman
turned and remarked: "An injunction has been served restraining
this election from going on, unless the votes on the
twenty-four hundred shares which you hold are first received,
and you had better vote." Thus appealed to, Mr. Fuller
modestly replied that he had not intended to vote at this
election, but, having been appointed receiver, he deemed it his
duty to do all in his power to preserve the property, and concluded
his statement by giving as a reason for his vote that
the ticket which he offered was composed of men of the highest
character and ability, whose election would best secure the
rights of all parties to the litigation. At the close of these
remarks he actually voted, and the curious spectacle was exhibited
of a court of equity taking a man's stock away from
him on the ground that it was illegally issued and could not
be voted on at all, and then proceeding to vote on it itself,
before the man's face and against his wishes. Viewed calmly,
and after the event, such a proceeding strikes one chiefly as an
extremely droll joke. The climax of the humorous, however,
was not attained until some months later, when Mr. Fuller
gravely stated in court that, as a receiver, he considered it his
duty to vote on stock without consulting the wishes of its
ostensible owner, and that for his services as receiver in this
case he had as yet received no remuneration, but expected
the regular fees, amounting to $15,000. After Mr. Fuller
had thus relieved Mr. Groesbeck of the trouble of voting, and
after the meeting in the next room had gone through a nominal
reorganization to meet the letter of the law, the polls
were declared open. The inspectors were withal euriously
careless, or too intent on the passage of time to think of aught
else; they certainly neglected to be qualified by taking oath
as to the performance of their duties, which was specially prescribed
in the by-laws; neither did they use any ballot-box,
other than the straw hat of one of their number. In this,
however, the ballots were deposited, and the election went
briskly on for some fifteen minutes, when, under the names
of John Doe, Richard Roe, and James Jackson, the inspectors
were again enjoined, this time from any further proceedings.
Most of their tickets had, however, already been voted, and
this injunction was violated by the reception of others, subsequently
offered, only in a moderate degree.

Meanwhile events did not stand still in the little library
adjoining the directors' room, where Mr. Ramsey and his
friends were collected. The sheriff of Albany, after leaving
the office of his legal adviser, proceeded to "do his duty."
As Mr. Ramsey was intently listening in the president's office
to Colonel North, who was moving the organization in the
next room, some one suddenly touched his arm, and he became
conscious of the sheriff at his side. Here was a thunderbolt.
At the very instant when his presence was most necessary,
when all depended on the full possession of his liberty and
his faculties, he found himself, the secretary of the company
and its legal adviser, under arrest. The thing could not have
been better timed. To understand the full possible effect of
this move, it is necessary to bear in mind a remark made
by Mr. Shearman in his subsequent testimony, though in another
connection: "I did n't want to lose a second's time, because
I knew the value of time in this case, and I knew
that the whole question would have to depend upon the
question of which meeting was organized first." The officials
of the road were therefore arrested, by mere accident, as it
was claimed, just when they should have been organizing
their meeting. Nor did the possible benefit to be derived
from this measure stop here. The election was limited to
one hour, and the sheriff was instructed "to do his duty."
He might have effected his arrest at ten o'clock; but had he
done so, the parties would have been bailed at once, and the
arrest might as well not have been made. Having been made
at exactly the right moment, the sheriff might now further
construe it to be his duty to remove the prisoners to his office,
there to arrange their bail. The votes on which Mr. Ramsey
relied were, of course, held by him in the usual form of proxies;
they were, in fact, on this day so cast by him. Could
he, therefore, be held in durance, away from the offices, by
any fictitious delays and objections, for one short hour, the
election would be over and irrevocably decided against him.
The construction the sheriff should give to "his duty" in the
premises was very vital, and fully warranted his lengthy interview
with that gentleman who was the common adviser of
himself and the Erie Railway Company. The whole proceeding
certainly spoke volumes for the ingenuity and resource
of those who engineered it. In its style it could not have
been improved.

Mr. Ramsey was thus a prisoner. He proposed at first to
leave the room to consult his friends, but was requested by
the sheriff to remain in it, and here he was soon visited by
Mr. David Dudley Field, of counsel for the Erie Railway
Company, who satisfied himself that the sheriff was doing
"his duty" by taking a comprehensive glance at the situation.
Finding this greatly to his mind, he then proceeded,
with a smile indicative of profound satisfaction and with his
thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat, to inquire of Mr.
Ramsey as to the present condition of his health. Mr. Ramsey
has the reputation of being a remarkably cool and imperturbable
man, so that now, when his counsel, Mr. Smith,
entered the room in a state of intense excitement and indignation,
and also under arrest, he received simply a direction
to go back and attend to the election, while Mr. Ramsey himself
effected the bail arrangements. It is not clear whether
the sheriff lacked nerve to construe his duty as he might have
done, or whether the delay already occasioned was considered
sufficient; at any rate, though he certainly arrested his prisoners
at exactly the proper moment, he did not remove them
from the building. He was, indeed, even provided with blank
bail bonds, which were produced and filled, though not until
objection had been made to the security of one or two gentlemen
notoriously worth millions; and this done the prisoners
were released. All this had occupied half an hour; on the
theory of Mr. Shearman it was now too late, the moment had
passed; the coup had been completely successful. Mr. Smith
had, indeed, gone back and organized a stockholders' meeting
in the hall of the building; but not until ten minutes after
twelve, and when the polls of the other organization had been
long open. The Erie party were, in their own belief, in possession
of the Albany & Susquehanna Railroad beyond a
peradventure.

Before going on with the narrative, a few words may here
be not out of place concerning the much-discussed question
of the limits, if there be any, of the duty which counsel owe
to their clients. The celebrated dictum of Lord Brougham
in this regard is sufficiently general in its terms: "An advocate,
by the sacred duty which he owes his client, knows, in
the discharge of that office, but one person in the world, that
CLIENT AND NONE OTHER. To save that client by all expedient
means, to protect that client at all hazards and costs to all
others, and among others to himself, is the highest and most
unquestioned of his duties; and he must not regard the
alarm, the suffering, the torment, the destruction which he
may bring on any other. Nay, separating even the duties
of a patriot from those of an advocate, and casting them,
if need be, to the wind, he must go on reckless of the consequences,
if his fate it should unhappily be to involve his
country in confusion for his client's sake!"

Certainly no counsel could have acted more fully up to
both the letter and spirit of this famous rule than did Messrs.
David Dudley Field and Thomas G. Shearman, of counsel for
the Erie Railway Company, on this notable occasion. They
even "cast to the wind" the single faint limitation conveyed
by Lord Brougham in the words "to save" and "to protect"
by all "expedient means"; and, in the intense fervor of their
devotion to their clients, had recourse in aggressive proceedings
to processes of law which were subsequently judicially
characterized as procured "in aid of fraudulent purposes.'
Attending one's clients to corporation meetings, at the head
of a band of "rude, rough, and dangerous persons" and there
acting as the master of ceremonies, through the parody of an
election, was a case which undoubtedly Brougham would have
included in his definition, had it occurred to him; but it
probably escaped his notice, from the fact that, since the fall
of the Roman Republic, such proceedings have not been usual.
The ingenious device, also, of arresting one's opposing counsel
and holding him to $25,000 bail, at the moment when his
professional services are likely to become peculiarly necessary,
is a feature in legal amenities with which the English barrister
could not have been expected to be familiar. A high authority
has now, however, established these as part of the duties
of the American advocate. Instances of similar devotion
will, therefore, unless the now obsolete practice of disbarring
should chance to be revived, probably hereafter become more
common than they hitherto have been. The use of unusual
processes of court, unpleasantly suggestive of _lettres de cachet_,
quietly procured and suddenly brought in play, would seem also
to have met of late with an undeserved odium. Whether
these will again arrive at the great efficiency as an element in
litigation which they once attained in France will, perhaps,
depend upon the degree of fidelity with which sheriffs do their
duty. For the shortcomings of such officials, advocates naturally
cannot be held accountable, even by the most exacting
of clients. The client, moreover, in whose defence Brougham
was prepared, if need be, "to involve his country in confusion"
was the Queen of England; which, indeed, cannot but
cause the deeper sense of a professional devotion, no less reckless,
exerted in furtherance of the schemes of Mr. James
Fisk, Jr.[^/183]


[^/183]: It ought, perhaps, to be stated in this connection, that the opinion commonly
entertained of the transactions with which the names of Fisk and
Gould are associated was not apparently shared by their counsel. These
gentlemen, whose close acquaintance with the facts in the case must certainly
I have qualified them to form an intelligent judgment, have made no concealment
of what that extra professional judgment was. Upon this point
Mr. Shearman expressed himself very explicitly before a legislative committee
at Albany on the 31st of March, 1870, six months subsequent to the Susquehanna
proceedings. He then paid the following high tribute to himself and to
Messrs. Field, Fisk, and Gould:---

"If I were to speak from my own personal judgment of the management
of the (Erie, road, I should say that I have never been able to find where these
fraudulent acts charged were committed. I have never been able to find
where the villany comes in. I have been looking for it very anxiously. I
have thought that the newspapers were edited by men so much wiser than
myself that they must know all about it, and I confess that when I entered
upon the service of the company, amid a perfect clamor on the part of the
newspapers, I thought they were edited by such wise men that there must be
something wrong, and I entered upon my duties with fear and trembling, but
I found no occasion for fear and trembling."

Mr. Littlejohn. You are speaking as a lawyer now?

Mr. Shearman. No, sir, as a man; and now as a lawyer I say that I
think it is no slight tribute to the character of the gentlemen who are in the
management of the Erie Company, that, knowing as they did how particular
I was in regard to the management of its officers, how careful I was that no
injustice should be done to the company, and how strongly determined I was
that its interests should not suffer, they confided their affairs in my hands.
And they have confided also in a gentleman of superior age and of very high
character, a gentleman with a Quixotic sense of honor, a gentleman who has
never done a dishonorable action, a gentleman whom the other side would have
been glad to engage for themselves if they could have done so, Mr David
Dudley Field. Mr. Field has been chosen by the Erie Railway Company as
their adviser, and, trained with Mr. Field, I have learned something of his
high sense of professional honor, etc.

To return from this abstract digression to the narrative,
little remains to be said of the election after the release of Mr.
Ramsey was effected. While bail was being procured, and the
necessary bonds executed, a second meeting had been organized
by Mr. Smith in the hall before the offices, and this meeting
had proceeded to choose inspectors, who were duly sworn
and received from the secretary the prescribed list of stockholders.
They then opened their polls in the same room and
at the same desk at which the opposition inspectors were still sitting.
Mr. Shearman immediately stepped in front of them and
began, on various grounds, to challenge every vote. Of course
his challenge was disregarded, but the process was kept up by
himself or others, until, towards one o'clock, both polls were
declared closed. Neither party attempted to vote at the polls
of the other, nor was there any disorder or disturbance. The
two boards then canvassed their votes; the Erie board declared
that the ticket voted for at their polls had received
13,400 votes, and was elected. Shortly afterwards the Ramsey
board declared that the ticket voted for at their poll had
received 10,742 votes, and was elected. The two boards of
directors thus chosen then met and organized, the one by the
choice of Colonel Church as president, and the other by the
re-election of Mr. Ramsey; and having then sufficiently regarded
each other from the opposite sides of the directors'
room, in due time they adjourned.

The election was over, and apparently nothing was decided
by it. Each of the boards elected claimed to be the regular
and only lawful one, and neither of them in any way recognized
the other. Fortunately the agents of Governor Hoffman
were still in actual possession. The Erie party had, indeed,
endeavored to take advantage of this fact, by including in their
list of directors both Messrs. McQuade and Banks, who were
then operating the road under the authority of the Governor.
This move wholly failed. Both of these gentlemen instantly
and peremptorily withdrew from the board when notified of
their election. Governor Hoffman was the one person now responsible,
and he very wisely called upon the courts to decide
who was legally entitled to the possession of the road. At his
direction the Attorney-General, immediately after the election,
began a new suit, in which all parties litigant were included,
and a general decision on the merits was prayed for. This
was the only way to cut the knot. The previous litigation
was in a state of hopeless chaos. Twenty-two suits had been
begun, a score of injunctions had been issued, numberless
orders had been made, and both parties now stood ready to
continue the same style of warfare, just as long as any
judge could be found who disregarded the duties of his
position on the one side, or who did not lack nerve on the
other.

The action brought by the Attorney-General came on for
trial before Justice E. Darwin Smith, at Rochester, on the 29th
of November succeeding the election. The intervening time
had been wasted by neither party. Messrs. Fisk and Gould
had utilized it in those manipulations of the gold market,
which had resulted in the celebrated explosion of September
24, long to be famous as the "black Friday" in Wall Street
annals. Mr. Ramsey, meanwhile, had confined his attention
to the quarrel already existing, and had carried the war vigorously
into Africa, assailing the Erie management in its own
stronghold through the suit of _Ramsey vs. Erie et als_. Writs,
orders, injunctions, receiverships, and conflicts of jurisdiction
had become matters of such daily occurrence as hardly to
excite a passing notice, and the complications which had grown
up around the Erie ring were only exceeded by the scandal
they caused. Hitherto, strong in the protection of the more
reckless of the city judges, Messrs. Gould and Fisk had suffered
no material defeat; they had, indeed, in so far as the
law was concerned, carried all before them; for to them the
law was simply a process for annoying others, and obstructing
all that was calculated to annoy them. Foiled in their attempt
to get control of the Susquehanna road by force, they did, indeed,
now try to get it by negotiation; they proposed a compromise
of all existing disputes on the basis of a lease of this
road by the Erie for a term of ninety-nine years, at a rent
equal to seven % on its bonds and stock outstanding,
with a thirty % stock dividend flung in as a bonus. The
Susquehanna people listened to the proposal, but it finally
appeared that no further guaranty than the word of the Erie
managers was contemplated. The Atlantic & Great Western
Railroad had already illustrated the value of that. Like Falstaff's
tailor, the Susquehanna people "liked not the security";
and the other party, like the fat old knight himself, "had as
lief they would put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it
with security." The negotiation fell wholly through, and
nothing remained but the arbitrament of a country justice of
the Supreme Court.

At the end of November the case was in order for trial. The
Executive, the Attorney-General, the court, and the Ramsey
counsel were ready and in earnest. The usual motions for delay
from the other side were received with little favor. It was
shown that another suit, in which Messrs. Fisk and Gould and
their leading counsel were engaged, was then on trial before
Judge Barnard. It was of no avail; the parties were ordered
to proceed, and the case before Judge Barnard had to be postponed.
The trial lasted ten days, and a vast amount of evidence
was put in. Mr. Fisk and Mr. Gould were conspicuous
by their absence from the witness-stand, but their counsel were
put upon it, and Messrs. Harris and Shearman each told his
own story. Some features of the evidence and incidents of the
trial were far from creditable. Among these may especially
be mentioned an attempt to create an impression that Mr.
Ramsey had once been under an indictment for forgery. So
grave a charge seemed most unlikely to be made without some
shadow of reason. In this case, however, it was wantonly
advanced, and even the machinery through which it was manufactured
was subsequently exposed. Naturally this proceeding
and others reacted violently on those who had sought to derive
advantage from them. Public feeling in the court-room and
in the city of Rochester grew very strong as the case proceeded,
showing itself in ways not to be mistaken. As the
case was on the equity side of the court, there was no intervention
of a jury, no chance of an inability to agree on a verdict.
After the evidence was all in, and the case had been
elaborately argued by Mr. David Dudley Field for the Erie
party, and by Mr. Henry Smith for the Susquehanna party,
Judge Smith took the papers, but reserved his decision. It
was January before this was made public.

There are cases where a judge upon the bench is called
upon to vindicate in no doubtful way the purity as well as the
majesty of the law; cases in which the parties before the court
should be made to feel that they are not equal, that fraud is
fraud even in a court of law, --- that cavilling and technicalities
and special pleading cannot blind the clear eye of equity.
It is possible that even a judicial tone may be overdone or
be out of place. There are occasions when the scales of justice
become almost an encumbrance, and both hands clutch at the
sword alone. Whether the magistrate upon whom the decision
of this cause devolved was right in holding this to be
such an occasion is not now to be discussed; it is enough to
say that his decision sustained at every point the Ramsey
board, and crushed in succession all the schemes of the Erie
ring. The opinion was most noticeable in that it approached
the inquiry in a large spirit. Its conclusion was not made to
turn on the question of a second of time, or a rigid adherence
to the letter of the law, or any other technicality of the pettifogger;
it swept all these aside and spoke firmly and clearly
to the question of fraud and fraudulent conspiracy. All the
elaborate comparison of watches, and noting of fractional parts
of a minute, which marked the organization of the Eric meeting
were treated with contempt, but the meeting itself was
pronounced to be organized in pursuance of a previous conspiracy,
and the election held by it was "irregular, fraudulent,
and void." The scandals of the law --- the strange processes,
injunctions, orders, and conflicts of jurisdiction --- were disposed
of with the same grasp, whenever they came in the path
of the decision. The appointment of Fuller as receiver was
declared to have been made in a "suit instituted for a fraudulent
purpose," and it was pronounced in such "clear conflict
with the law and settled practice of the court" as to be explicable
only on a supposition that the order was "granted
incautiously, and upon some mistaken oral representation or
statement of the facts of the case." The order removing the
regular inspectors of election was "improvidently granted"
and was "entirely void"; and the keeping it back by counsel,
and serving it only at the moment of election, was "an obvious
and designed surprise on the great body of stockholders."
The suit under which the Barnard order of arrest was
issued against Ramsey and Phelps was instituted without right,
the order of arrest was unauthorized, the order to hold to
bail "most extraordinary and exorbitant," and was procured
"in aid of fraudulent purposes." The injunction forbidding
Ramsey to act as president of the company was "entirely
void." The three thousand shares of forfeited stock reissued
to Mr. Groesbeck were pronounced "valid stock," and numerous
precedents were cited in which the principle had been sustained.
Even the subscription for the nine thousand five
hundred new shares of stock by Ramsey and his friends, onl
which they had not even attempted to vote at the election,
was declared, in point of law, regular, valid, and binding.
Upon the facts of the case the decision was equally outspoken;
it was fraud and conspiracy everywhere. "The importation
and crowding into a small room" of a large number of "rude,
rough, and dangerous persons," and furnishing them with
proxies that they might participate in the proceedings of the
meeting, was a gross perversion and abuse of the right to
vote by proxy and a clear infringement of the rights of stockholders,
tending, if such proceedings are countenanced by the
courts, to convert corporation meetings into places of disorder,
lawlessness, and riot." Finally, costs were decreed to the
Ramsey board of directors, and a reference was made to Samuel
L. Selden, late a judge of the Court of Appeals, to ascertain
and report a proper extra allowance in the case, and to
which of the defendants it was to be paid.

The legal scandals of the case were not yet quite exhausted.
No sooner was this decision announced and telegraphed to
New York, than the Erie counsel at once had recourse to the
judges of that city. As a matter of course, an _ex parte_ order
was instantly granted, staying the entry of judgment. It
reached Rochester a few hours too late; the judgment was
entered. The next day a new order was obtained, staying all
proceedings under the judgment; and this was served on
Messrs. Banks and McQuade, who were still in possession of
the road. Recourse was had to Judge Peckham, who quietly
declared the stay of no effect, and granted an order putting
the Ramsey board in possession. Then at last the keys were
delivered to them. The Erie counsel were not yet satisfied.
A motion was made to vacate the judgment. This was supported
by affidavits of counsel of the most unusual nature.
Imputations of unfairness, irregularity, bias, and conduct otherwise
wholly unbecoming a magistrate, were advanced against
Judge Smith. The four leading lawyers of the defeated party
then united in a certificate, which concluded with these singular
words: "We have examined the opinion of Mr. Justice
Smith in this cause, and, in our judgment, it is in every material
part erroneous, either in fact or in law. It may be
necessary to mention here that this was a certificate of counsel
on the losing side of a decided case, applying to one judge of
the Supreme Court of New York, to vacate a judgment just
entered by another judge of the same court. It ought to be
unnecessary to add that the assumptions on which the motion
was based were pronounced "simply monstrous"; and the
affidavits were ordered to be stricken from the record as "irrelevant
and impertinent." Nothing now remained to the Erie
faction but the slow process of appeal, with their opponents in
actual possession.

The struggle was over. Long before any action could be
taken on the decision of Judge Smith, at the general term of
the court, the Albany & Susquehanna Railroad was beyond the
reach of Fisk or Gould or the Erie Railway. Early in February,
1870, the Ramsey direction leased the whole property in
perpetuity, and on very favorable terms, to the Hudson &
Delaware Canal Company. This arrangement transferred the
struggle from the comparatively weak shoulders of the railroad
itself to those of one of the most powerful and wealthy
corporations in the country. With it the Erie managers
could not afford to quarrel, so they were fain to profess themselves
satisfied with the result, and to desist from the contest.

Meanwhile the Hon. Samuel L. Selden was busy over his
reference; and the case was wellnigh forgotten before he made
his report.
When it was made, it was calculated to revive a
very fresh recollection of the litigation in the minds of Mr.
Fisk's board of directors. This was composed of thirteen
individuals, of whom Messrs. Fisk and Gould were two. The
report of Mr. Selden was long and very minutely drawn; it
was a document likely to be accepted by the court, and not
easily overthrown on appeal. "In view of the whole history
of this extraordinary case," and in consideration of the assumption
by the Albany & Susquehanna Railroad Co. of the entire
expenses of the litigation, the sum of ninety-two thousand dollars
was fixed upon as a just and proper extra allowance to be
paid by the persons constituting the Fisk board of directors to
those persons constituting the Ramsey board.[^/191]


[^/191]: An appeal was taken by the Fisk board of directors from the decision of
Judge Smith, referred to in the text, and reported in Abbot's Pr. Rep. N. S.
p. 265. The decision of the General Term was not announced until May, 1971.
I: turned wholly upon technical points, and in no respect entered into the
merits of the controversy: upon these the findings of the court below were apparently
accepted as conclusive. The decision of Judge Smith was afirmed
in so far as it declared the election of the Fisk beard fraudulent and void, and
that of the Ramsey board valid, on the ground that this question was properly
before the court, and it was competent to pass upen it. Judge Smith had also
decreed that the proceedings in all the suits on either side between the parties
defendant should be stayed and discontinued. This relief. it was held, upon
technical grounds, the court below was not competent to grant, and upon this
point the decision was reversed. It was also reversed upon the question of
costs, upon the ground that in an action brought by the People against two
sets of defendants the court had no power to grant costs to one set against the
other.

The Ramsey party was, therefore, sustained in the possession of the property:
but the Fisk party escaped the payment of costs under the Selden refer
ence. So far as the scandals in litigation were concerned, which gave so great
a notoriety to this case between the preparation and publication of this paper.
the court at General Term confined itself to a simple closing reference to them.
Profound regret was expressed at the occurrences which had preceded the
action then before the court, which in itself, however, it was declared had been
market by no unbecoming conduct on the part of counsel.
