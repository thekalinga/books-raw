# The New York Gold Conspiracy[^/100]

\ 

_House of Representatives. Report, No. 31. Forty-first Congress,
Second Session. Report of the Committee on Banking
and Currency, in response to a Resolution of the House of
Representatives, passed December 13, 1869, directing the Committee
"to investigate the causes that led to the unusual and
extraordinary fluctuations of Gold in the City of New York,
from the 21st to the 27th of September, 1869" ; accompanied
by the Testimony collected by the Committee._

The civil war in America, with its enormous issues of depreciating
currency, and its reckless waste of money and credit
by the government, created a speculative mania such as the
United States, with all its experience in this respect, had never
before known. Not only in Broad Street, the centre of New
York speculation, but far and wide throughout the Northern
States, almost every man who had money at all employed a
part of his capital in the purchase of stocks or of gold, of copper,
of petroleum, or of domestic produce, in the hope of a
rise in prices, or staked money on the expectation of a fall.
To use the jargon of the street, every farmer and every shopkeeper
in the country seemed to be engaged in "carrying
some favorite security "on a margin." Whoever could obtain
five pounds sent it to a broker with orders to buy fifty pounds'
worth of stocks, or whatever amount the broker would consent
to purchase. If the stock rose, the speculator prospered; if
it fell until the five pounds of deposit or margin were lost, the
broker demanded a new deposit, or sold the stock to protect
himself. By means of this simple and smooth machinery,
which differs in no essential respect from the processes of
_roulette_ or _rouge-et-noir_, the whole nation flung itself into the
Stock Exchange, until the "outsiders," as they were called, in
opposition to the regular brokers of Broad Street, represented
nothing less than the entire population of the American Republic.
Every one speculated, and for a time every one
speculated successfully.

[^/100]: From the Westminster Review, for October, 1870.

The inevitable reaction began when the government, about
a year after the close of the war, stopped its issues and ceased
borrowing. The greenback currency had for a moment sunk
to a value of only 37 cents to the dollar. It is even asserted
that on the worst day of all, the 11th of July, 1864, one sale
of £20,000 in gold was actually made at 310, which is equivalent
to about 33 cents in the dollar.[^/101] At this point, however,
the depreciation stopped; and the paper which had come so
near falling into entire discredit steadily rose in value, first
to 50 cents, then to 60, to 70, and within the present year to
more than 90 cents. So soon as the industrious part of the
public felt the touch of this return to solid values, the whole
fabric of fictitious wealth began to melt away under their
eyes.

Thus it was not long before the so-called "outsiders," the
men who speculated on their own account, and could not act
in agreement or combination, began to suffer. One by one, or
in great masses, they were made the prey of the larger operators;
their last margins were consumed, and they dropped
down to the solid level of slow, productive industry. Some
lost everything; many lost still more than they had, and there
are few families of ordinary connection and standing in the
United States which cannot tell, if they choose, some dark
story of embezzlement, or breach of trust, committed in these
days. Some men, who had courage and a sense of honor,
found life too heavy for them; others went mad. But the
greater part turned in silence to their regular pursuits, and
accepted their losses as they could. Almost every rich American
could produce from some pigeon-hole a bundle of worthless
securities, and could show check-books representing the
only remaining trace of margin after margin consumed in vain
attempts to satisfy the insatiable broker. A year or two of
incessant losses swept the weaker gamblers from the street.

[^/101]: _See_ Men and Mysteries of Wall Street, by James K. Medbery, pp. 250, 251.

But even those who continued to speculate found it necessary
to change their mode of operations. Chance no longer
ruled over the Stock Exchange and the gold market. The
fate of a battle, the capture of a city, or the murder of a
President, had hitherto been the influences which broke
through the plans of the strongest combinations, and put all
speculators, whether great or small, on fairly even ground;
but as the period of sudden and uncontrollable disturbing
elements passed away, the market fell more and more completely
into the hands of cliques which found a point of adhesion
in some great mass of incorporated capital. Three
distinct railways, with all their enormous resources, became
the property of Cornelius Vanderbilt, who, by means of their
credit and capital, again and again swept millions of dollars
into his pocket by a process curiously similar to gambling
with loaded dice. But Vanderbilt was one of the most respectable
of these great operators. The Erie Railway was
controlled by Daniel Drew, and while Vanderbilt at least acted
in the interests of his corporations, Drew cheated equally his
corporation and the public. Between these two men and the
immense incorporated power they swayed, smaller operators,
one after another, were crushed to pieces, until the survivors
learned to seek shelter within some clique sufficiently strong
to afford protection. Speculation in this manner began to
consume itself, and the largest combination of capital was destined
to swallow every weaker combination which ventured to
show it itself in the market.

Thus, between the inevitable effect of a currency which
steadily shrank the apparent wealth of the country, and the
omnipotence of capital in the stock market, a sounder and
healthier state of society began to make itself felt. Nor
could the unfortunate public, which had been robbed with
such cynical indifference by Drew and Vanderbilt, feel any
sincere regret when they saw these two cormorants reduced to
tearing each other. In the year 1867 Mr. Vanderbilt undertook
to gain possession of the Erie Road, as he had already
obtained possession of the New York Central, the second
trunk line between New York and the West. Mr. Vanderbilt
was supposed to own property to the value of some £10,000,000,
all of which might be made directly available for stock operations.
He bought the greater part of the Erie stock; Drew
sold him all he could take, and then issued as much more as
was required in order to defeat Vanderbilt's purpose. After a
violent struggle, which overthrew all the guaranties of social
order, Drew triumphed, and Mr. Vanderbilt abandoned the
contest. The Erie corporation paid him a large sum to reimburse
his alleged losses. At the same time it was agreed that
Mr. Drew's accounts should be passed, and he obtained a
release in full, and retired from the direction. And the Erie
Road, almost exhausted by such systematic plundering, was
left in the undisturbed, if not peaceful, control of Mr. Jay
Gould and Mr. James Fisk, Jr., whose reign began in the
month of July, 1868.

Mr. Jay Gould was a partner in the firm of Smith, Gould,
& Martin, brokers, in Wall Street. He had been engaged
before now in railway enterprises, and his operations had not
been of a nature likely to encourage public confidence in his
ideas of fiduciary relations. He was a broker, and a broker
is almost by nature a gambler, perhaps the very last profession
suitable for a railway manager. In character he was strongly
marked by his disposition for silent intrigue. He preferred as
a rule to operate on his own account, without admitting other
persons into his confidence, and he seemed never to be satisfied
except when deceiving every one as to his intentions.
There was a reminiscence of the spider in his nature. He
spun huge webs, in corners and in the dark, which were seldom
strong enough to resist a serious strain at the critical
moment. His disposition to this subtlety and elaboration
of intrigue was irresistible. It is scarcely necessary to say
that he had not a conception of a moral principle. In speaking
of this class of men it must be fairly assumed at the outset
that they do not and cannot understand how there can be
a distinction between right and wrong in matters of speculation,
so long as the daily settlements are punctually effected.
In this respect Mr. Gould was probably as honest as the mass
of his fellows, according to the moral standard of the street;
but without entering upon technical questions of roguery, it is
enough to say that he was an uncommonly fine and unscrupulous
intriguer, skilled in all the processes of stock-gambling,
and passably indifferent to the praise or censure of society.

James Fisk, Jr., was still more original in character. He
was not yet forty years of age, and had the instincts of fourteen.
He came originally from Vermont, probably the most
respectable and correct State in the Union, and his father had
been a pedler who sold goods from town to town in his native
valley of the Connecticut. The son followed his father's
calling with boldness and success. He drove his huge wagon,
made resplendent with paint and varnish, with four or six
horses, through the towns of Vermont and Western Massachusetts;
and when his father remonstrated in alarm at his reckless
management, the young man, with his usual bravado, took
his father into his service at a fixed salary, with the warning
that he was not to put on airs on the strength of his new
dignity. A large Boston firm which had supplied his goods on
credit, attracted by his energy, took him into the house; the
war broke out; his influence drew the firm into some bold
speculations which were successful; in a few years he retired
with some £20,000, which he subsequently lost. He formed
a connection with Daniel Drew in New York, and a new sign,
ominous of future trouble, was raised in Wall Street, bearing
the names of Fisk & Belden, brokers.

Personally Mr. Fisk was coarse, noisy, boastful, ignorant;
the typeof a young butcher in appearance and mind. Nothng
could be more striking than the contrast between him and
his future associate Gould. One was small and slight in person,
dark, sallow, reticent, and stealthy, with a trace of Jewish
origin. The other was large, florid, gross, talkative, and obstreperous.
Mr. Fisk's redeeming point was his humor, which
had a strong flavor of American nationality. His mind was
extraordinarily fertile in ideas and expedients, while his conversation
was filled with unusual images and strange forms of
speech, which were caught up and made popular by the New
York press. In respect to honesty as between Gould and Fisk,
the latter was, perhaps, if possible, less deserving of trust
than the former. A story not without a keen stroke of satirical
wit is told by him, which illustrates his estimate of abstract
truth. An old woman who had bought of the elder Fisk a
handkerchief which cost ninepence in the New England currency,
where six shillings are reckoned to the dollar, complained
to Mr. Fisk, Jr., that his father had cheated her. Mr.
Fisk considered the case maturely, and gave a decision based
on _a priori_ principles. "No!" said he, "the old man would n't
have told a lie for ninepence"; and then, as if this assertion
needed some reasonable qualification, he added, "though he
would have told eight of them for a dollar!" The distinction
as regards the father may have been just, since the father
seems to have held old-fashioned ideas as to wholesale and
retail trade; but in regard to the son even this relative degree
of truth cannot be predicated with any confidence, since,
if the Investigating Committee of Congress and its evidence are
to be believed, Mr. Fisk seldom or never speaks truth at all.

An intrigue equally successful and disreputable brought
these two men into the Erie Board of Directors, whence they
speedily drove their more timid predecessor Drew. In July,
1868, Gould made himself President and Treasurer of the
corporation. Fisk became Comptroller. A young lawyer,
named Lane, became counsel. These three directors made a
majority of the Executive Committee, and were masters of
Erie. The Board of Directors held no meetings. The Executive
Committee was never called together, and the three men
--- Fisk, Gould, and Lane --- became from this time the absolute,
irresponsible owners of the Erie Railway, not less than if
it had been their personal property and plaything.

This property was in effect, like all the great railway
corporations, an empire within a republic. It consisted of
a trunk line of road 459 miles in length, with branches
314 miles in extent, or 773 miles of road in all. Its
capital stock amounted to about £7,000,000. Its gross receipts
exceeded £3,000,000 per annum. It employed not
less than 15,000 men, and supported their families. Over all
this wealth and influence, greater than that directly swayed
by any private citizen, greater than is absolutely and personally
controlled by most kings, and far too great for the public
safety either in a democracy or in any other form of society,
the vicissitudes of a troubled time placed two men in irresponsible
authority; and both these men belonged to a low
and degraded moral and social type. Such an elevation has
been rarely seen in modern history. Even the most dramatic
of modern authors, even Balzae himself, who so loved to deal
with similar violent alternations of fortune, or Alexandre
Dumas, with all his extravagance of imagination, never have
reached a conception bolder or more melodramatic than this,
nor have they ever ventured to conceive a plot so enormous,
or a catastrophe so original, as was now to be developed.

One of the earliest acts of the new rulers was precisely such
as Balzac or Dumas might have predicted and delighted in.
They established themselves in a palace. The old offices of
the Erie Railway were in the lower part of the city, among the
wharves and warehouses; a situation, no doubt, convenient
for business, but by no means agreeable as a residence; and
the new proprietors naturally wished to reside on their property.
Mr. Fisk and Mr. Gould accordingly bought a huge
building of white marble, not unlike a European palace, situated
about two miles from the business quarter, and containing
a large theatre or opera-house. They also purchased several
smaller houses adjoining it. The opera-house cost about
£140,000, and a large part of the building was at once leased,
by the two purchasers, to themselves as the Erie corporation,
to serve as offices. This suite of apartments was then furnished
by themselves, as representing the corporation, at an
expense of some £60,000, and in a style which, though called
vulgar, is certainly not more vulgar than that of the President's
official residence, and which would be magnificent in
almost any palace in Europe. The adjoining houses were
connected with the main building; and in one of these Mr.
Fisk had his private apartments, with a private passage to his
opera-box. He also assumed direction of the theatre, of
which he became manager-in-chief. To these royal arrangements
he brought tastes which have been commonly charged
as the worst results of royal license. The atmosphere of the
Erie offices was not supposed to be disturbed with moral prejudices;
and as the opera itself supplied Mr. Fisk's mind with
amusement, so the opera troupe supplied him with a permanent
harem. Whatever Mr. Fisk did was done on an extraordinary
scale.

These arrangements, however, regarded only the pleasures
of the American Aladdin. In the conduct of their interests
the new directors showed a capacity for large conceptions, and
a vigor in the execution of their schemes, such as alarmed the
entire community. At the annual election in 1868, when
Gould, Fisk, and Lane, having borrowed or bought proxies for
the greater part of the stock, caused themselves to be elected
for the ensuing year, the respectable portion of the public
throughout the country was astonished and shocked to learn
that the new Board of Directors contained two names peculiarly
notorious and obnoxious to honest men, --- the names of
William M. Tweed and Peter B. Sweeney. To English ears
these commonplace, not to say vulgar, titles do not seem singularly
alarming; but to every honest American they conveyed
a peculiar sense of terror and disgust. The State of
New York in its politics is much influenced, if not controlled,
by the city of New York. The city politics are so entirely
the hands of the Democratic party as to preclude even the existence
of a strong minority. The party organization centres
in a political club, held together by its patronage and the
money it controls through a system of jobbery unequalled
elsewhere in the world. And the Tammany Club, thus swaying
the power of a small nation of several million souls, is itself
ruled by William M. Tweed and Peter B. Sweeney, absolute
masters of this terrible system of theft and fraud, and to
American eyes the incarnation of political immorality.

The effect of this alliance was felt in the ensuing winter in
the passage of a bill through the State legislature, and its signature
by the Governor, abolishing the former system of annual
elections of the entire board of Erie directors, and
authorizing the board to classify itself in such a manner that
only a portion should be changed each year. The principle
of the bill was correct. Its practical effect, however, was to
enable Gould and Fisk to make themselves directors for five
years, in spite of any attempt on the part of the stockholders
to remove them. The formality of annual re-election was
spared them; and so far as the stockholders were concerned,
there was no great injustice in the act. The Erie Road was
in the peculiar position of being without an owner. There
was no cestui que trust, unless the English stockholders could
be called such. In America the stock was almost exclusively
held for speculation, not for investment; and in the morals of
Wall Street speculation means, or had almost come to mean,
disregard of intrinsic value. In this case society at large was
the injured party, and society knew its risk.

This step, however, was only a beginning. The Tammany
ring, as it is called, exercised a power far beyond politics.
Under the existing constitution of the State, the judges of the
State courts are elected by the people. There are thirtythree
such judges in New York, and each of the thirty-three
is clothed with equity powers running through the whole
State. Of these judges Tammany Hall elected several, and
the Erie Railway controlled others in country districts. Each
of these judges might forbid proceedings before any and all
the other judges, or stay proceedings in suits already commenced.
Thus the lives and the property of the public were
in the power of the new combination; and two of the city
judges, Barnard and Cardozo, had already acquired a peculiarly
infamous reputation as so-called "slaves to the ring," which
left no question as to the depths to which their prostitution
of justice would descend.

The alliance between Tammany and Erie was thus equivalent
to investing Mr. Gould and Mr. Fisk with the highest
attributes of sovereignty; but in order to avail themselves to
the utmost of their judicial powers, they also required the
ablest legal assistance. The degradation of the bench had
been rapidly followed by the degradation of the bar. Prominent
and learned lawyers were already accustomed to avail
themselves of social or business relations with judges to forward
private purposes. One whose partner might be elevated
to the bench was certain to be generally retained in cases
brought before this special judge; and litigants were taught
by experience that a retainer in such cases was profitably bestowed.
Others found a similar advantage resulting from
known social relations with the court. The debasement of
tone was not confined to the lower ranks of advocates; and
it was probably this steady demoralization of the bar which
made it possible for the Erie ring to obtain the services of
Mr. David Dudley Field as its legal adviser. Mr. Field, a
gentleman of European reputation, in regard to which he is
understood to be peculiarly solicitous, was an eminent law
reformer, author of the New York Code, delegate of the
American Social Science Association to the European International
Congress, and asserted by his partner, Mr. Shearman,
in evidence before a committee of the New York legislature,
to be a man of quixotic sense of honor. Mr. Shearman himself,
a gentleman of English parentage, had earned public gratitude
by arraigning and deploring, with unsurpassed courage
and point, the condition of the New York judiciary, in an
admirable essay which will be found in the North American
Review for July, 1867. The value of Mr. Field's services to
Messrs. Fisk and Gould was not to be measured even by the
enormous fees their generosity paid him. His power over
certain judges became so absolute as to impress the popular
imagination; and the gossip of Wall Street insists that he
has a silken halter round the neck of Judge Barnard, and a
hempen one round that of Cardozo. It is certain that he
who had a year before threatened Barnard on his own bench
with impeachment now appeared in the character of Barnard's
master, and issued as a matter of course the edicts
of his court.

One other combination was made by the Erie managers to
extend their power, and this time it was credit that was
threatened. They bought a joint-stock bank in New York
City, with a capital of £200,000.) The assistance thus gained
was purchased at a very moderate price, since it was by no
means represented by the capital. The great cliques and socalled
"operators" of Wall Street and Broad Street carry on
their transactions by a system of credits and clearing-houses
with a very limited use of money. The banks certify their
checks, and the certified checks settle all balances. Nominally
and by law the banks only certify to the extent of _bona
fide_ deposits, but in reality the custom of disregarding the
strict letter of the law is not unknown, and in regard to the
bank in question, the Comptroller of the Currency, an officer
of the National Treasury, testifies that on an examination of
its affairs in April, 1869, out of fifteen checks deposited in its
hands as security for certifications made by it, selected at hazard
for inquiry, and representing a nominal value of £300,000,
three only were good. The rest represented accommodation
extended to brokers and speculators without security. As an
actual fact it is in evidence that this same bank on Thursday,
September 24, 1869, certified checks to the amount of nearly
£1,500,000 for Mr. Gould alone. What sound security Mr.
Gould deposited against this mass of credit may be left to the
imagination. His operations, however, were not confined to
this bank alone, although this was the only one owned by the
ring.

Thus Mr. Gould and Mr. Fisk created a combination more
powerful than any that has been controlled by mere private
citizens in America or in Europe since society for self-protection
established the supreme authority of the judicial name.
They exercised the legislative and the judicial powers of the
State; they possessed almost unlimited credit, and society was
at their mercy. One authority alone stood above them, beyond
their control; and this was the distant but threatening
figure of the National Government.

Nevertheless, powerful as they were, the Erie managers
were seldom in funds. The huge marble palace in which they
lived, the theatre which they supported, the reckless bribery
and profusion of management by which they could alone maintain
their defiance of public opinion, the enormous schemes
for extending their operations into which they rushed with
utter recklessness, all required greater resources than could be
furnished even by the wholesale plunder of the Erie Road.
They were obliged from time to time to issue from their castle
and harry the industrious public or their brother freebooters.
The process was different from that known to the dark ages,
but the objects and the results were equally robbery. At one
time Mr. Fisk is said to have ordered heavy speculative sales
of stock in an express company which held a contract with
the Erie Railway. The sales being effected, the contract was
declared annulled. The stock naturally fell, and Mr. Fisk
realized the difference. He then ordered heavy purchases,
and having renewed the contract the stock rose again, and Mr.
Fisk a second time swept the street.[^/111] In the summer and
autumn of 1869 the two managers issued and sold 235,000
new shares of Erie stock, or nearly as much as its entire capital
when they assumed power in July, 1868. With the aid of the
money thus obtained, they succeeded in withdrawing about
£2,500,000 in currency from circulation at the very moment
of the year when currency was most in demand in order to
harvest the crops. For weeks the whole nation writhed and
quivered under the torture of this modern rack, until the
national government itself was obliged to interfere and threaten
a sudden opening of the treasury. But whether the Erie
speculators operated for a rise or operated for a fall, whether
they bought or sold, and whether they were engaged in manipulating
stocks, or locking up currency, or cornering gold, they
were always a public nuisance and scandal.


[^/111]: Men and Mysteries of Wall Street, p. 168.

In order to explain the operation of a so-called corner in
gold to ordinary readers with the least possible use of slang or
technical phrases, two preliminary statements are necessary.
In the first place it must be understood that the supply of
gold immediately available for transfers is limited within distinct
bounds in America. New York and the country behind
it contain an amount usually estimated at about £4,000,000.
The national government commonly holds from £15,000,000
to £20,000,000, which may be thrown bodily on the market
if the President orders it. To obtain gold from Europe or
other sources requires time.

In the second place, gold in America is a commodity bought
and sold like stocks in a special market or gold-room which is
situated next the Stock Exchange in Broad Street and is practically
a part of it. In gold as in stocks, the transactions are
both real and speculative. The real transactions are mostly purchases
or loans made by importers who require coin to pay
customs on their imports. This legitimate business is supposed
to require from £1,000,000 to £1,500,000 per day.
The speculative transactions are mere wagers on the rise or
fall of price, and neither require any actual transfer of gold,
nor even imply its existence, although in times of excitement
hundreds of millions nominally are bought, sold, and loaned.

Under the late administration Mr. McCulloch, then Secretary
of the Treasury, had thought it his duty at least to
guarantee a stable currency, although Congress forbade him
to restore the gold standard. During four years gold had
fluctuated little, and principally from natural causes, and the
danger of attempting to create an artificial scarcity in it had
prevented the operators from trying an experiment which
would have been sure to irritate the government. The financial
policy of the new administration was not so definitely
fixed, and the success of a speculation would depend on the
action of Mr. Boutwell, the new secretary, whose direction was
understood to have begun by a marked censure on the course
pursued by his predecessor.

Of all financial operations, cornering gold is the most brilliant
and the most dangerous, and possibly the very hazard
and splendor of the attempt were the reasons of its fascination
to Mr. Jay Gould's fancy. He dwelt upon it for months,
and played with it like a pet toy. His fertile mind even went
so far as to discover that it would prove a blessing to the
community, and on this ingenious theory, half honest and
half fraudulent, he stretched the widely extended fabric of the
web in which all mankind was to be caught. This theory
was in itself partially sound. Starting from the principle that
the price of grain in New York is regulated by the price in
London and is not affected by currency fluctuations, Mr.
Gould argued that if it were possible to raise the premium on
gold from thirty to forty cents at harvest-time, the farmers'
grain would be worth $1.40 instead of $1.30, and as a consequence
the farmer would hasten to send all his crop to New
York for export, over the Erie Railway, which was sorely in
need of freights. With the assistance of another gentleman,
Mr. Gould calculated the exact premium at which the Western
farmer would consent to dispose of his grain, and thus distance
the three hundred sail which were hastening from the
Danube to supply the English market. Gold, which was then
heavy at 34, must be raised to 45.

This clever idea, like all the other ideas of these gentlemen
of Erie, seems to have had the single fault of requiring that
some one, somewhere, should be swindled. The scheme was
probably feasible; but sooner or later the reaction from such
an artificial stimulant must have come, and whenever it came
some one must suffer. Nevertheless, Mr. Gould probably
argued that so long as the farmer got his money, the Erie Railway
its freights, and he himself his small profits on the gold
he bought, it was of little consequence who else might be
injured; and, indeed, by the time the reaction came, and gold
was ready to fall as he expected, Mr. Gould would probably
have been ready to assist the process by speculative sales in
order to enable the Western farmer to buy his spring goods
cheap as he had sold his autumn crops dear. He himself was
equally ready to buy gold cheap and sell it dear on his private
account; and as he proposed to bleed New York merchants
for the benefit of the Western farmer, so he was willing to
bleed Broad Street for his own. The patriotic object was,
however, the one which for obvious reasons Mr. Gould preferred
to put forward most prominently, and on the strength
of which he hoped to rest his ambitious structure of intrigue.

In the operation of raising the price of gold from 133 to
145, there was no great difficulty to men who controlled the
resources of the Erie Railway. Credit alone was needed, and
of credit Mr. Gould had an unlimited supply. The only
serious danger lay in the possible action of the national government,
which had not taken the same philanthropic view
of the public good as was peculiar to the managers of Erie.
Secretary Boutwell, who should have assisted Mr. Gould in
"bulling" gold, was gravely suspected of being a bear, and
of wishing to depress the premiums to nothing. If he were
determined to stand in Mr. Gould's path, it was useless even
for the combined forces of Erie and Tammany to jostle
against him; and it was therefore essential that Mr. Gould
should control the government itself, whether by fair means
or foul, by persuasion or by purchase. He undertook the
task; and now that his proceedings in both directions have
been thoroughly drawn into light, it is well worth while for
the public to see how dramatic and how artistically admirable
a conspiracy in real life may be, when slowly elaborated from
the subtle mind of a clever intriguer, and carried into execution
by a band of unshrinking scoundrels.

The first requisite for Mr. Gould's purpose was some channel
of direct communication with the President; and here he was
peculiarly favored by chance. Mr. Abel Rathbone Corbin, formerly
lawyer, editor, speculator, lobby-agent, familiar, as he
claims, with everything, had succeeded, during his varied
career, in accumulating from one or another of his hazardous
pursuits a comfortable fortune, and he had crowned his success,
at the age of sixty-seven or thereabouts, by contracting
a marriage with General Grant's sister, precisely at the moment
when General Grant was on the point of reaching the
highest eminence possible to an American citizen. To say
that Mr. Corbin's moral dignity had passed absolutely pure
through the somewhat tainted atmosphere in which his life
had been spent, would be flattering him too highly; but at
least he was now no longer engaged in any active occupation,
and he lived quietly in New York, watching the course of public
affairs, and remarkable for an eminent respectability which
became the President's brother-in-law. Mr. Gould enjoyed a
slight acquaintance with Mr. Corbin, and he proceeded to
improve it. He assumed, and he asserts that he really felt, a
respect for Mr. Corbin's shrewdness and sagacity. It is amusing
to observe that Mr. Corbin claims to have first impressed
the famous crop theory on Mr. Gould's mind; while Mr.
Gould testifies that he himself indoctrinated Mr. Corbin with
this idea, which became a sort of monomania with the President's
brother-in-law, who soon began to preach it to the
President himself. On the 15th of June, 1869, the President
came to New York, and was there the guest of Mr.
Corbin, who urged Mr. Gould to call and pay his respects to
the Chief Magistrate. Mr. Gould had probably aimed at
precisely this result. He called; and the President of the
United States not only listened to the president of Erie, but
accepted an invitation to Mr. Fisk's theatre, sat in Mr. Fisk's
private box, and the next evening became the guest of these
two gentlemen on their magnificent Newport steamer, while
Mr. Fisk, arrayed, as the newspapers reported, "in a blue
uniform, with a broad gilt cap-band, three silver stars on his
coat-sleeve, lavender gloves, and a diamond breast-pin as large
as a cherry, stood at the gangway, surrounded by his aids,
bestarred and bestriped like himself," and welcomed his distinguished
friend.

It had been already arranged that the President should on
this occasion be sounded in regard to his financial policy; and
when the selected guests --- among whom were Mr. Gould, Mr.
Fisk, and others --- sat down at nine o'clock to supper, the
conversation was directed to the subject of finance. "Some
one," says Mr. Gould, "asked the President what his view
was." The "some one" in question was, of course, Mr. Fisk,
who alone had the impudence to put such an inquiry. The
President bluntly replied, that there was a certain amount of
fictitiousness about the prosperity of the country, and that the
bubble might as well be tapped in one way as another. The
remark was fatal to Mr. Gould's plans, and he felt it, in his
own words, as a wet blanket.

Meanwhile the post of assistant-treasurer at New York had
become vacant, and it was a matter of interest to Mr. Gould
that some person friendly to himself should occupy this position,
which, in its relations to the public, is second in importance
only to the secretaryship of the treasury itself. Mr.
Gould consulted Mr. Corbin, and Mr. Corbin suggested the
name of General Butterfield, --- a former officer in the volunteer
army. The appointment was not a wise one; nor does it
appear in evidence by what means Mr. Corbin succeeded in
bringing it about. There is a suggestion that he used Mr.
A. T. Stewart, the wealthy importer, as his instrument for
the purpose; but whatever the influence may have been, Mr.
Corbin appears to have set it in action, and General Butterfield
entered upon his duties towards the 1st of July.

The elaborate preparations thus made show that some
large scheme was never absent from Mr. Gould's mind, although
between the months of May and August he made no
attempt to act upon the markets. But between the 20th of
August and the 1st of September, in company with Messrs.
Woodward and Kimber, two large speculators, he made what
is known as a pool, or combination, to raise the premium on
gold, and some ten or fifteen millions were bought, but with
very little effect on the price. The tendency of the market
was downwards, and it was not easily counteracted. Perhaps
under ordinary circumstances he might have now abandoned
his project; but an incident suddenly occurred which seems
to have drawn him headlong into the boldest operations.

Whether the appointment of General Butterfield had any
share in strengthening Mr. Gould's faith in Mr. Corbin's secret
powers does not appear in evidence, though it may readily
be assumed as probable. At all events, an event now took
place which would have seemed to authorize an unlimited faith
in Mr. Corbin, as well as to justify the implicit belief of an
Erie treasurer in the corruptibility of all mankind. The unsuspicious
President again passed through New York, and
came to breakfast at Mr. Corbin's house on the 2d of September.
He saw no one but Mr. Corbin while there, and the
same evening at ten o'clock departed for Saratoga. Mr. Gould
declares, however, that he was told by Mr. Corbin that the
President, in discussing the financial situation, had shown
himself a convert to the Erie theory about marketing the
crops, and had "stopped in the middle of a conversation in
which he had expressed his views, and written a letter" to
Secretary Boutwell. This letter is not produced; but Secretary
Boutwell testifies as follows in regard to it :--

>I think on the evening of the 4th of September I received a letter
from the President dated at New York, as I recollect it; I am
not sure where it is dated. I have not seen the letter since the
night I received it. I think it is now in my residence in Groton.
In that letter he expressed an opinion that it was undesirable to
foree down the price of gold. He spoke of the importance to the
West of being able to move their crops. His idea was that if gold
should fall, the West would suffer, and the movement of the crops
would be retarded. The impression made on my mind by the letter
was that he had rather a strong opinion to that effect. ... Upon
the receipt of the President's letter on the evening of the 4th of September,
I telegraphed to Judge Richardson \[Assistant Secretary at
Washington\] this despatch: 'Send no order to Butterfield as to
sales of gold until you hear from me.'

Mr. Gould had therefore succeeded in reversing the policy
of the national government; but this was not all. He knew
what the government would do before any officer of the government
knew it. Mr. Gould was at Corbin's house on the 2d
of September; and although the evidence of both these gentlemen
is very confused on this point, the inference is inevitable
that Gould saw Corbin privately, unknown to the President,
within an hour or two after this letter to Mr. Boutwell
was written, and that it was at this interview, while the President
was still in the house, that Mr. Corbin gave him the
information about the letter; perhaps showed him the letter
itself. Then followed a transaction worthy of the French
stage. Mr. Corbin's evidence gives his own account of it:---

>On the 2d of September (referring to memoranda) Mr. Gould
>offered to let me have some of the gold he then possessed. ...
>He spoke to me as he had repeatedly done before, about taking a
>certain amount of gold owned by him. I finally told Mr. Gould
>that for the sake of a lady, my wife, I would accept of $500,000 of
>gold for her benefit, as I shared his confidence that gold would rise.
> ... He afterwards insisted that I should take a million more, and
>I did so on the same conditions for my wife. He then sent me this
>paper."
>
>The paper in question is as follows:---
>
>"Smith, Gould, Martin, & Co., Bankers,
>11 Broad Street, New York, September 2, 1869.
>
>"Mr. ---
>
>"Dear Sir: we have bought for your account and risk ---
>
>500,000, gold, 132, R.
>
>1,000,000, gold, 133⅝, R.
>
>which we will carry on demand with the right to use.
>
>"SMITH, GOULD, MARTIN, & Co."

This memorandum meant that for every rise of one %
in the price of gold Mr. Corbin was to receive £3,000, and
his name nowhere to appear. If the inference is correct that
Gould had seen Corbin in the morning and had learned from
him what the President had written, it is clear that he must
have made his bargain on the spot, and then going directly to
the city, he must in one breath have ordered this memorandum
to be made out and large quantities of gold to be purchased,
before the President had allowed the letter to leave
Mr. Corbin's house.

No time was lost. On this same afternoon, Mr. Gould's
brokers bought large amounts in gold. One testifies to buying
$1,315,000 at 134⅛. On the 3d the premium was forced
up to 36; on the 4th, when Mr. Boutwell received his letter,
it had risen to 37. Here, however, Mr. Gould seems to have
met a check, and he describes his own position in nervous
Americanisms as follows:---

>I did not want to buy so much gold. In the spring I put gold
up from 32 to 38 and 40, with only about seven millions. But all
these fellows went in and sold short, so that in order to keep it up
I had to buy, or else to back down and show the white feather.
They would sell it to you all the time. I never intended to buy
more than four or five millions of gold, but these fellows kept purchasing
it on, and I made up my mind that I would put it up to 40
at one time. ... We went into it as a commercial transaction,
and did not intend to buy such an amount of gold. I was forced
into it by the bears selling out. They were bound to put it down.
I got into the contest. All these other fellows deserted me like rats
from a ship. Kimber sold out and got short. ... He sold out
at 37. He got short of it, and went up "( or, in English, he failed).

It was unfortunate that the bears would not consent to lie
still and be flayed, but this was unquestionably the fact. They
had the great operators for once at a disadvantage, and they
were bent on revenge. Mr. Gould's position was very hazardous.
When Mr. Kimber sold out at 37, which was probably
on the 7th of September, the market broke; and on the 8th
the price fell back to 35. Nor was this all. At the same
moment, when the "pool" was ended by Mr. Kimber's desertion,
Mr. Corbin, with his eminent shrewdness and respectability,
told Mr. Gould "that gold had gone up to 37," and
that he "should like to have this matter realized," which was
equivalent to saying that he wished to be paid something on
account. This was on the 6th; and Gould was obliged this
same day to bring him a check for £5,000, drawn to the order
of Jay Gould, and indorsed in blank by him with a touching
regard for Mr. Corbin's modest desire not to have his name
appear. There are few financiers in the world who will not
agree that this transaction does great credit to Mr. Corbin's
sagacity. It indicates at least that he was acquainted with
the men he dealt with. Undoubtedly it placed Mr. Gould in
a difficult position; but as Mr. Gould already held some fifteen
millions of gold and needed Mr. Corbin's support, he preferred
to pay £5,000 outright rather than allow Corbin to throw his
gold on the market. Yet the fabric of Gould's web had now
been so seriously injured that, for a whole week, from the 8th
to the 15th of September, he was at a loss what to do, unable
to advance and equally unable to retreat without very severe
losses. He sat at his desk in the opera-house, silent as usual,
and tearing little slips of paper which he threw on the floor
in his abstraction, while he revolved new combinations in his
mind.

Down to this moment Mr. James Fisk, Jr., has not appeared
in the affair. Gould had not taken him into his confidence;
and it was not until after the 10th of September
that Gould appears to have decided that there was nothing
else to be done. Fisk was not a safe ally in so delicate an
affair, but apparently there was no choice. Gould approached
him; and, as usual, his touch was like magie. Mr. Fisk's
evidence begins here, and may be believed when very strongly
corroborated:

>Gold having settled down to 35, and I not having cared to touch
it, he was a little sensitive on the subject, feeling as if he would
rather take his losses without saying anything about it. ... One
day he said to me, 'Don't you think gold has got to the bottom?'
I replied that I did not see the profit in buying gold unless you have
got into a position where you can command the market. He then
said he had bought quite a large amount of gold, and I judged from
his conversation that he wanted me to go into the movement and
help strengthen the market. Upon that I went into the market
and bought. I should say that was about the 15th or 16th of September.
I bought at that time about seven or eight millions, I think.

The market responded slowly to these enormous purchases;
and on the 16th the clique was still struggling to recover its
lost ground.

Meanwhile Mr. Gould had placed another million and a half
of gold to the account of General Butterfield, and notified him
of the purchase. So Mr. Gould swears in spite of General
Butterfield's denial. The date of this purchase is not fixed.
Through Mr. Corbin a notice was also sent by Gould about the
middle of September to the President's private secretary, General
Porter, informing him that half a million was placed to his
credit. General Porter instantly wrote to repudiate the purchase,
but it does not appear that Butterfield took any notice
of Gould's transaction on his account. On the 10th of September
the President had again come to New York, where he
remained his brother-in-law's guest till the 13th; and during
this visit Mr. Gould appears again to have seen him, although
Mr. Corbin avers that on this occasion the President intimated
his wish to the servant that this should be the last time Mr.
Gould obtained admission. "Gould was always trying to get
something out of him," he said; and if he had known how
much Mr. Gould had succeeded in getting out of him, he
would have admired the man's genius, even while shutting the
door in his face. On the morning of the 13th the President
set out on a journey to the little town of Washington, situated
among the mountains of Western Pennsylvania, where
he was to remain a few days. Mr. Gould, who now consulted
Mr. Corbin regularly every morning and evening, was still
extremely nervous in regard to the President's policy; and as
the crisis approached, this nervousness led him into the fatal
blunder of doing too much. The bribe offered to Porter was
a grave mistake, but a greater mistake yet was made by
pressing Mr. Corbin's influence too far. He induced Mr.
Corbin to write an official article for the New York press on
the financial policy of the government, an article afterwards
inserted in the New York Times through the kind offices of
Mr. James McHenry, and he also persuaded or encouraged Mr.
Corbin to write a letter directly to the President himself. This
letter, written on the 17th under the influence of Gould's anxiety,
was instantly sent away by a special messenger of Fisk's to
reach the President before he returned to the capital. The
messenger carried also a letter of introduction to General
Porter, the private secretary, in order to secure the personal
delivery of this important despatch.

We have now come to the week which was to witness the
explosion of all this elaborately constructed mine. On Mon-.
day, the 20th, gold again rose. Throughout Tuesday and
Wednesday Fisk continued to purchase without limit, and
forced the price up to 40. At this time Gould's firm of Smith,
Gould, & Martin, through which the operation was conducted,
had purchased some $50,000,000; and yet the bears went on
selling, although they could only continue the contest by borrowing
Gould's own gold. Gould, on the other hand, could
no longer sell and clear himself, for the very reason that the
sale of $50,000,000 would have broken the market to noth
ing. The struggle had become intense. The whole country
was looking on with astonishment at the battle between the
bulls and the bears. All business was deranged, and all values
unsettled. There were indications of a panic in the stock
market; and the bears in their emergency were vehemently
pressing the government to intervene. Gould now wrote to
Mr. Boutwell a letter so inconceivably impudent that it indicates
desperation and entire loss of his ordinary coolness. He
began:---

>SIR, --- There is a panic in Wall Street, engineered by a bear
combination. They have withdrawn currency to such an extent
that it is impossible to do ordinary business. The Erie Company
requires eight hundred thousand dollars to disburse. . . Much
of it in Ohio, where an exciting political contest is going on, and
where we have about ten thousand employed, and the trouble is
charged on the administration. ... Cannot you, consistently,
increase your line of currency ?

From a friend such a letter would have been an outrage ;
but from a member of the Tammany ring, the principal object
of detestation to the government, such a threat or bribe ---
whichever it may be called --- was incredible. Mr. Gould was,
in fact, at his wits' end. He dreaded a panic, and he felt that
it could no longer be avoided.

The scene now shifts for a moment to the distant town of
Washington, among the hills of Western Pennsylvania. On
the morning of the 19th of September, President Grant and
his private secretary, General Porter, were playing croquet on
the grass, when Fisk's messenger, after twenty-four hours of
travel by rail and carriage, arrived at the house, and sent in
to ask for General Porter. When the President's game was
ended, General Porter came, received his own letter from
Corbin, and called the President, who entered the room and
took his brother-in-law's despatch. He then left the room,
and after some ten or fifteen minutes' absence returned. The
messenger, tired of waiting, then asked, "Is it all right?
"All right," replied the President; and the messenger hastened
to the nearest telegraph station, and sent word to Fisk,
"Delivered; all right."

The messenger was, however, altogether mistaken. Not
only was all not right, but all was going hopelessly wrong.
The President, it appears, had at the outset supposed the man
to be an ordinary post-office agent, and the letter an ordinary
letter which had arrived through the post-office. Nor was it
until Porter asked some curious question as to the man, that
the President learned of his having been sent by Corbin merely
to carry this apparently unimportant letter of advice. The
President's suspicions were at once excited; and the same evening,
at his request, Mrs. Grant wrote a hurried note to Mrs. Corbin,
telling her how greatly the President was distressed at the
rumor that Mr. Corbin was speculating in Wall Street, and
how much he hoped that Mr. Corbin would "instantly disconnect
himself with anything of that sort."

This letter, subsequently destroyed or said to have been
destroyed by Mrs. Corbin, arrived in New York on the morning
of Wednesday the 22d, the same day on which Gould and
his enemies the bears were making their simultaneous appeals
to Secretary Boutwell. Mrs. Corbin was greatly excited and
distressed by her sister-in-law's language. She at once carried
the letter to her husband, and insisted that he should instantly
abandon his interest in the gold speculation. Mr. Corbin,
although he considered the scruples of his wife and her family
to be highly absurd, assented to her wish; and when Mr.
Gould came that evening as usual, with $50,000,000 of gold
on his hands, and extreme anxiety on his mind, Corbin read
to him two letters: the first, written by Mrs. Grant to Mrs.
Corbin; the second, written by Mr. Corbin to President Grant,
assuring him that he had not a dollar of interest in gold.
The assurance of this second letter was, at any sacrifice, to be
made good.

Mr. Corbin proposed that Mr. Gould should give him a
check for £20,000, and take his $1,500,000 off his hands. A
proposition more calmly impudent than this can scarcely be
imagined. Gould had already paid Corbin £5,000, and Corbin
asked for £20,000 more, at the very moment when it was
clear that the £5,000 he had received had been given him
under a misunderstanding of his services. He even had the
impudence to represent himself as doing Gould a favor by
letting him have a million and a half more gold at the highest
market price, at a time when Gould had fifty millions which
it was clear he must sell or be ruined. What Gould might,
under ordinary circumstances, have replied, may be imagined;
but at this moment he could say nothing. Corbin had but to
show this note to a single broker in Wall Street, and the
whole fabric of Gould's speculation would have fallen to
pieces. Gould asked for time and went away. He consulted
no one. He gave Fisk no hint of what had happened. The
next morning he returned to Corbin, and made him the following
offer:---

>Mr. Corbin, I cannot give you anything if you will go out.
If you will remain in, and take the chances of the market, I will
give you my check \[for £20,000\].' And then,' says Mr. Corbin,
'I did what I think it would have troubled almost any other business
man to consent to do, -refuse one hundred thousand dollars on
a rising market. If I had not been an old man married to a middleaged
woman, I should have done it (of course with her consent) just
as sure as the offer was made. I said, 'Mr. Gould, my wife says
"No!" Ulysses thinks it wrong, and that it ought to end.' So I
gave it up. ... He looked at me with an air of severe distrust, as
if he was afraid of treachery in the camp. He remarked, 'Mr. Corbin,
I am undone if that letter gets out.'... He stood there for a
little while looking very thoughtful, exceedingly thoughtful. He
then left and went into Wall Street, ... and my impression is
that he it was, and not the government, that broke that market.'

Mr. Corbin was right; throughout all these transactions
his insight into Mr. Gould's character was marvellous.

It was the morning of Thursday, the 3d; Gould and Fisk
went to Broad Street together, but as usual Gould was silent
and secret, while Fisk was noisy and communicative. There
was now a complete separation in their movements. Gould
acted entirely through his own firm of Smith, Gould, & Martin,
while Fisk operated principally through his old partner,
Belden. One of Smith's principal brokers testifies:---

>Fisk never could do business with Smith, Gould, & Martin very
comfortably. They would not do business for him. It was a very
uncertain thing of course where Fisk might be. He is an erratic
sort of genius. I don't think anybody would want to follow him
very long. I am satisfied that Smith, Gould, & Martin controlled
their own gold, and were ready to do as they pleased with it without
consulting Fisk. I do not think there was any general agreement.
... None of us who knew him cared to do business with
him. I would not have taken an order from him nor had anything
to do with him.' Belden was considered a very low fellow. 'I
never had anything to do with him or his party,' said one broker
employed by Gould. They were men I had a perfect detestation
of; they were no company for me. I should not have spoken to
them at all under any ordinary circumstances.' Another says,
'Belden is a man in whom I never had any confidence in any way.
For months before that, I would not have taken him for a gold
transaction.'

And yet Belden bought millions upon millions of gold. He
himself says he had bought twenty millions by this Thursday
evening, and this without capital or credit except that of his
brokers. Meanwhile Gould, on reaching the city, had at once
given secret orders to sell. From the moment he left Corbin,
he had but one idea, which was to get rid of his gold as quietly
as possible. "I purchased merely enough to make believe I
was a bull," says Gould. This double process continued all
that afternoon. Fisk's wild purchases carried the price up to
144, and the panic in the street became more and more serious.
as the bears realized the extremity of their danger. No one
can tell how much gold which did not exist they had contracted
to deliver or pay the difference in price. One of the
clique brokers swears that on this Thursday evening the street
had sold the clique one hundred and eighteen millions of gold,
and every rise of one % on this sum implied a loss of
more than £200,000 to the bears. Naturally the terror was
extreme, for half Broad Street and thousands of speculators
would have been ruined if compelled to settle gold at 150
which they had sold at 140. It need scarcely be said that by
this time nothing more was heard in regard to philanthropic
theories of benefit to the Western farmer.

Mr. Gould's feelings can easily be imagined. He knew that
Fisk's reckless management would bring the government upon
his shoulders, and he knew that unless he could sell his gold
before the order came from Washington he would be a ruined
man. He knew, too, that Fisk's contracts must inevitably be
repudiated. This Thursday evening he sat at his desk in the
Erie offices at the opera-house, while Fisk and Fisk's brokers
chattered about him.

>I was transacting my railway business. I had my own views
about the market, and my own fish to fry. I was all alone, so to
speak, in what I did, and I did not let any of those people know
exactly how I stood. I got no ideas from anything that was said
there. I had been selling gold from 35 up all the time, and I did
not know till the next morning that there would probably come an
order about twelve o'clock to sell gold.

He had not told Fisk a word in regard to Corbin's retreat,
nor his own orders to sell.

When the next day came, Gould and Fisk went together to
Broad Street, and took possession of the private back office
of a principal broker, "without asking the privilege of doing
so," as the broker observes in his evidence. The first news
brought to Gould was a disaster. The government had sent
three men from Washington to examine the bank which Gould
owned, and the bank sent word to Mr. Gould that it feared to
certify for him as usual, and was itself in danger of a panic,
caused by the presence of officers, which created distrust of the
bank. It barely managed to save itself. Gould took the
information silently, and his firm redoubled sales of gold.
His partner, Smith, gave the orders to one broker after another,
--- "Sell ten millions!" "The order was given as quick
as a flash, and away he went," says one of these men. 'I
sold only eight millions." "Sell, sell, sell! do nothing but
sell! --- only don't sell to Fisk's brokers," were the orders
which Smith himself acknowledges. In the gold-room Fisk's
brokers were shouting their rising bids, and the packed crowd
grew frantic with terror and rage as each successive rise showed.
their increasing losses. The wide streets outside were thronged
with excited people; the telegraph offices were overwhelmed
with messages ordering sales or purchases of gold or stocks;
and the whole nation was watching eagerly to see what the
result of this convulsion was to be. All trade was stopped,
and even the President felt that it was time to raise his hand.
No one who has not seen the New York gold-room can understand
the spectacle it presented; now a perfect pandemonium,
now silent as the grave. Fisk, in his dark back office across
the street, with his coat off, swaggered up and down, "a big
cane in his hand," and called himself the Napoleon of Wall
Street. He really believed that he directed the movement,
and while the street outside imagined that he and Gould were
one family, and that his purchases were made for the clique,
Gould was silently flinging away his gold at any price he could
get for it.

Whether Fisk really expected to carry out his contract, and
force the bears to settle, or not, is doubtful; but the evidence
seems to show that he was in earnest, and felt sure of success.
His orders were unlimited. "Put it up to 150," was one
which he sent to the gold-room. Gold rose to 150. At length
the bid was made --- "160 for any part of five millions," and
no one any longer dared take it. "161 for five millions," ---
"162 for five millions." No answer was made, and the offer
was repeated,"162 for any part of five millions." A voice
replied, --- "Sold one million at 62." The bubble suddenly
burst, and within fifteen minutes, amid an excitement without
parallel even in the wildest excitements of the war, the clique
brokers were literally swept away, and left struggling by themselves,
bidding still 160 for gold in millions which no one
would any longer take their word for; while the premium sank
rapidly to 135. A moment later the telegraph brought from
Washington the government order to sell, and the result was
no longer possible to dispute. (Mr. Fisk had gone too far, while
Mr. Gould had secretly weakened the ground under his feet.

Gould, however, was saved. His fifty millions were sold;
and although no one yet knows what his gains or losses may
have been, his firm was now able to meet its contracts and
protect its brokers. Fisk was in a very different situation.
So soon as it became evident that his brokers would be unable
to carry out their contracts, every one who had sold gold to
them turned in wrath to Fisk's office. Fortunately for him
it was protected by armed men whom he had brought with
him from his castle of Erie; but nevertheless the excitement
was so great that both Mr. Fisk and Mr. Gould thought it best
to retire as rapidly as possible by a back entrance leading into
another street, and to seek the protection of the opera-house.
There nothing but an army could disturb them; no civil mandate
was likely to be served without their permission within
these walls, and few men would care to face Fisk's ruffians in
order to force an entrance.

The subsequent winding up of this famous conspiracy may
be stated in few words. But no account could possibly be
complete which failed to reproduce in full the story of Mr.
Fisk's last interview with Mr. Corbin, as told by Fisk himself.

>I went down to the neighborhood of Wall Street, Friday morning,
and the history of that morning you know. When I got back
to our office, you can imagine I was in no enviable state of mind,
and the moment I got up street that afternoon I started right round
to old Corbin's to rake him out. I went into the room, and sent
word that Mr. Fisk wanted to see him in the dining-room. I was
too mad to say anything civil, and when he came into the room,
said I, 'You damned old scoundrel, do you know what you have
done here, you and your people?' He began to wring his hands,
and, 'Oh!' he says, 'this is a horrible position. Are you ruined?'
I said I didn't know whether I was or not; and I asked him again
if he knew what had happened? He had been crying, and said he
had just heard; that he had been sure everything was all right;
but that something had occurred entirely different from what he
had anticipated. Said I, 'That don't amount to anything; we know
that gold ought not to be at 31, and that it would not be but for such
performances as you have had this last week; you know damned
well it would not if you had not failed.' I knew that somebody
had run a saw right into us, and said I, 'This whole damned thing
has turned out just as I told you it would.' I considered the whole
party a pack of cowards, and I expected that when we came to
clear our hands they would sock it right into us. I said to him, 'I
don't know whether you have lied or not, and I don't know what
ought to be done with you.' He was on the other side of the table,
weeping and wailing, and I was gnashing my teeth. Now,' he
says, 'you must quiet yourself.' I told him I did n't want to be
quiet. I had no desire to ever be quiet again, and probably never
should be quiet again. He says, 'But, my dear sir, you will lose
your reason.' Says I, 'Speyers \[a broker employed by him that
day\] has already lost his reason; reason has gone out of everybody
but me.' I continued, 'Now what are you going to do? You have
got us into this thing, and what are you going to do to get out of it?'
He says, 'I don't know. I will go and get my wife.' I said, 'Get
her down here!' The soft talk was all over. He went up stairs
and they returned, tottling into the room, looking older than Stephen
Hopkins. His wife and he both looked like death. He was tottling
just like that. \[Illustrated by a trembling movement of his body.\]
I have never seen him from that day to this.

This is sworn evidence before a committee of Congress; and
its humor is perhaps the more conspicuous, because there is
every reason to believe that there is not a word of truth in
the story from beginning to end. No such interview ever
occurred, except in the unconfined apartments of Mr. Fisk's
imagination. His own previous statements make it certain
that he was not at Corbin's house at all that day, and
that Corbin did come to the Erie offices that evening, and
again the next morning. Corbin himself denies the truth
of the account without limitation; and adds, that when he
entered the Erie offices the next morning Fisk was there.
"I asked him how Mr. Gould felt after the great calamity of
the day before." He remarked, "O, he has no courage at all.
He has sunk right down. There is nothing left of him but a
heap of clothes and a pair of eyes." The internal evidence of
truth in this anecdote would support Mr. Corbin against the
world.[^/130]

In regard to Mr. Gould, Fisk's graphic description was probably
again inaccurate. Undoubtedly the noise and scandal
of the moment were extremely unpleasant to this silent and
impenetrable intriguer. The city was in a ferment, and the
whole country pointing at him with wrath. The machinery
of the gold exchange had broken down, and he alone could
extricate the business community from the pressing danger
of a general panic. He had saved himself, it is true; but in
a manner which could not have been to his taste. Yet his
course from this point must have been almost self-evident to
his mind, and there is no reason to suppose that he hesitated.


[^/130]: Mr. Fisk to the Editor of the Sun:---

Erie Railway Company, Comptroller's Office,

NEW YORK, October 4, 1869.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE SUN.

Dear Sir,---

... Mr. Corbin has constantly associated with me; ... he
spent more than an hour with me in the Erie Railway Office on the afternoon of
Saturday, September 25th, the day after the gold panic. ... I enclose you a
few affidavits which will give you further information concerning this matter.

I remain your obedient servant,

JAMES FISK, JR.

Affidavit of Charles W. Pollard.

State of New York, City and County of New York, ss.

"C. W. Pollard, being duly sworn, says: 'I have frequently been the bearer
of messages between Mr. James Fisk, Jr., and Mr. Abel R. Corbin, brotherin-law
of President Grant. ... Mr. Corbin called on me at the Erie building
on Thursday, 23d September, 1869, telling me he came to see how Messrs.
Fisk and Gould were getting along. ... He called again on Friday, the
following day, at about noon; appeared to be greatly excited and said he
feared we should lose a great deal of money. The following morning, Saturday,
September 25, Mr. Fisk told me to take his carriage and call upon Mr. Corbin
and say to him that he and Mr. Gould would like to see him (Corbin) at their
office. I called and saw Mr. Corbin. He remarked upon greeting me: "How
does Mr. Fisk bear his losses?" and added, " It is terrible for us." He then
asked me to bring Mr. Fisk up to his house immediately, as he was indisposed,
and did not feel able to go down to his (Fisk's) office. I went after Mr. Fisk,
who returned immediately with me to Mr. Corbin's residence, but shortly
after came out with Mr. Corbin, who accompanied him to Mr. Fisk's office,
where he was closeted with him and Mr. Gould for about two hours ..."

There are obvious inconsistencies among these different accounts, which it
is useless to attempt to explain. The fact of Saturday's interview appears,
however, to be beyond dispute.

His own contracts were all fulfilled. Fisk's contracts, all
except one, in respect to which the broker was able to compel
a settlement, were repudiated. Gould probably suggested to
Fisk that it was better to let Belden fail, and to settle a handsome
fortune on him, than to sacrifice something more than
£1,000,000 in sustaining him. Fisk therefore threw Belden
over, and swore that he had acted only under Belden's order;
in support of which statement he produced a paper to the
following effect :---

>September 24.
>
>DEAR SIR, I hereby authorize you to order the purchase and
>sale of gold on my account during this day to the extent you may
>deem advisable, and to report the same to me as early as possible.
>It is to be understood that the profits of such order are to belong
>entirely to me, and I will, of course, bear any losses resulting.
>
>Yours,
>
>WILLIAM BELDEN.

>JAMES FISK, JR.

This document was not produced in the original, and certainly
never existed. Belden himself could not be induced to
acknowledge the order; and no one would have believed him
if he had done so. Meanwhile the matter is before the national
courts, and Fisk may probably be held to his contracts :
but it will be far more difficult to execute judgment upon him,
or to discover his assets.

One of the first acts of the Erie gentlemen after the crisis
was to summon their lawyers, and set in action their judicial
powers. The object was to prevent the panic-stricken brokers
from using legal process to force settlements, and so render
the entanglement inextricable. Messrs. Field and Shearman
came, and instantly prepared a considerable number of injunctions,
which were sent to their judges, signed at once, and inmediately
served. Gould then was able to dictate the terms
of settlement; and after a week of complete paralysis, Broad
Street began at last to show signs of returning life. As a
legal curiosity, one of these documents, issued three months
after the crisis, may be reproduced, in order to show the
powers wielded by the Erie managers:---

>SUPREME COURT.
>
>H. N. SMITH, JAY GOULD, H. H. MARTIN,
>and J. B. BACII, Plaintiffs,
>
>against
>
>JOHN BONNER and ARTHUR L. SEWELL,
>Defendants,
>
>Injunction by order.
>
>It appearing satisfactorily to me by the complaint duly verified
>by the plaintiff's that sufficient grounds for an order of injunction
>exist, I do hereby order and enjoin. ... That the defendants,
>John Bonner and Arthur L. Sewell, their agents, attorneys, and
>servants, refrain from pressing their pretended claims against the
>plaintiffs, or either of them, before the Arbitration Committee of the
>New York Stock Exchange, or from taking any proceedings thereon,
>or in relation thereto, except in this action.
>
>GEORGE G. BARNARD, J. S. C.

>NEW YORK, December 29, 1869.

Mr. Bonner had practically been robbed with violence by
Mr. Gould, and instead of his being able to bring the robber
into court as the criminal, the robber brought him into court
as criminal, and the judge forbade him to appear in any other
character. Of all Mr. Field's distinguished legal reforms and
philanthropic projects, this injunction is beyond a doubt the
most brilliant and the most successful.[^/132]


[^/132]: These remarks on Mr. Field's professional conduct as counsel of the Erie
Railway have excited a somewhat intemperate controversy, and Mr. Field's
partisans in the press have made against the authors of the "Chapters of
Erie" a charge which certainly has the merit of even exaggerated modesty
on the part of the New York bench and bar, namely, that these writers
"have indelicately interfered in a matter alien to them in every way"; the
administration of justice in New York being, in this point of view, a matter
in which Mr. Field and the Erie Railway are alone concerned. Mr. Field himself
has published a letter in the Westminster Review for April, 1871, in
which, after the general assertion that the passages in the "New York Gold
Conspiracy" which relate to him "cover about as much untruth as could be
crowded into so many lines," he proceeds to make the following corrections:

First, he denies, what was never suggested, that he was in any way a party to
the origin or progress of the Gold Conspiracy; until (secondly) he was consulted
on the 28th of September; when (thirdly) he gave an opinion as to the powers
of the members of the Gold and Stock Exchanges. Fourthly, he denies that
he has relations of any sort with any judge in New York, or any power over
these judges, other than such as English counsel have in respect to English
judges. Fifthly, he asserts that out of twenty-eight injunctions growing out
of the gold transactions. his partners obtained only ten, and only one of these
ten, the one quoted above, from Justice Barnard. Sixthly, that this injunction
was proper to be sought and granted. Seventhly, that Mr. Bonner was
not himself the person who had been "robbed with violence," but the assignee
of the par ies.

On the other hand it does not appear that Mr. Field denies that the injunction
as quoted is genuine, or that he is responsible for it, or that it did, as asserted,
shut the defendan's out of the courts as well as out of the Gold Exchange
Arbitration Committee, or that it compelled them to appear only as
defendants in a case where they were the injured parties.

In regard to the power which Mr. Field, whether as a private individual or
as Erie counsel, has exercised over the New York bench, his modest denial is
hardly calculated to serve as a final answer. And in regard to Mr. Bonner,
the fact of his being principal or representative scarcely affects the character
of Mr Field's injunction. Finally, so far as the text is concerned, after allowing
full weight to all Mr. Field's corrections, the public can decide for itself
how many untruths it contains. The subject has, however, ceased to be one
of consequence even to Mr. Field since the subsequent violent controversy
which arose in March, 1871, in regard to other points of Mr. Field's professional
conduct, and in another month after his letter was written he would
perhaps have thought the comments of the Westminster Review so comparatively
trifling in importance as not to deserve his attention.

The fate of the conspirators was not severe. Mr. Corbin
went to Washington, where he was snubbed by the President,
and at once disappeared from public view, only coming to
light again before the Congressional Committee. General
Butterfield, whose share in the transaction is least understood,
was permitted to resign his office without an investigation.
Speculation for the next six months was at an end.
Every person involved in the affair seemed to have lost money,
and dozens of brokers were swept from the street. -But Mr.
Jay Gould and Mr. James Fisk, Jr., continued to reign over
Erie, and no one can say that their power or their credit was
sensibly diminished by a shock which for the time prostrated
all the interests of the country.

Nevertheless it is safe to predict that sooner or later the
last traces of the disturbing influence of war and paper money
will disappear in America, as they have sooner or later disappeared
in every other country which has passed through the
same evils. The result of this convulsion itself has been in
the main good. It indicates the approaching end of a troubled
time. Messrs. Gould and Fisk will at last be obliged to yield
to the force of moral and economical laws. The Erie Railway
will be rescued, and its history will perhaps rival that of
the great speculative manias of the last century. The United
States will restore a sound basis to its currency, and will learn
to deal with the political reforms it requires. Yet though the
regular process of development may be depended upon, in its
ordinary and established course, to purge American society of
the worst agents of an exceptionally corrupt time, there is in
the history of this Erie corporation one matter in regard to
which modern society everywhere is directly interested. For
the first time since the creation of these enormous corporate
bodies, one of them has shown its power for mischief, and has
proved itself able to override and trample on law, custom, decency,
and every restraint known to society, without scruple,
and as yet without check. The belief is common in America
that the day is at hand when corporations far greater than the
Erie --- swaying power such as has never in the world's history
been trusted in the hands of mere private citizens, controlled
by single men like Vanderbilt, or by combinations of men
like Fisk, Gould, and Lane, after having created a system of
quiet but irresistible corruption --- will ultimately succeed in
directing government itself. Under the American form of
society, there is now no authority capable of effective resistance.
The national government, in order to deal with the corporations,
must assume powers refused to it by its fundamental
law, and even then is always exposed to the chance of forming
an absolute central government which sooner or later is likely
to fall into the very hands it is struggling to escape, and thus
destroy the limits of its power only in order to make corruption
omnipotent. Nor is this danger confined to America
alone. The corporation is in its nature a threat against the
popular institutions which are spreading so rapidly over the
whole world. Wherever there is a popular and limited government
this difficulty will be found in its path, and unless
some satisfactory solution of the problem can be reached,
popular institutions may yet find their very existence endangered.
