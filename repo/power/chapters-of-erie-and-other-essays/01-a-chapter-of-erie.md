# A Chapter of Erie[^/1]

Not a generation has passed away during the last six hundred
years without cherishing a more or less earnest conviction
that, through its efforts, something of the animal had
been eliminated from the higher type of man. Probably, also,
no generation has been wholly mistaken in nourishing this
faith; --- even the worst has in some way left the race of men
on earth better in something than it found them. And yet it
would not be difficult for another Rousseau to frame a very ingenious
and plausible argument in support of the opposite view.
Scratch a Russian, said the first Napoleon, and you will find a
Cossack; call things by their right names, and it would be no
difficult task to make the cunning civilization of the nineteenth
century appear but as a hypocritical mask spread over the
more honest brutality of the twelfth. Take, for instance, some
of the cardinal vices and abuses of the imperfect past. Pirates
are commonly supposed to have been battered and hung out
of existence when the Barbary Powers and the Buccaneers of
the Spanish Main had been finally dealt with. Yet freebooters
are not extinct; they have only transferred their operations to
the land, and conducted them in more or less accordance with
the forms of law; until, at last, so great a proficiency have they
attained, that the commerce of the world is more equally but
far more heavily taxed in their behalf, than would ever have
entered into their wildest hopes while, outside the law, they
simply made all comers stand and deliver. Now, too, they no
longer live in terror of the rope, skulking in the hiding-place
of thieves, but flaunt themselves in the resorts of trade and
fashion, and, disdaining such titles as once satisfied Ancient
Pistol or Captain Macheath, they are even recognized as President
This or Colonel That. A certain description of gambling,
also, has ceased to be fashionable; it is years since Crockford's
doors were closed, so that in this respect a victory is claimed
for advancing civilization. Yet this claim would seem to be
unfounded. Gambling is a business now where formerly it
was a disreputable excitement. Cheating at cards was always
disgraceful; transactions of a similar character under the
euphemistic names of "operating," "cornering," and the like
are not so regarded. Again, legislative bribery and corruption
were, within recent memory, looked upon as antiquated
misdemeanors, almost peculiar to the unenlightened period of
Walpole and Fox, and their revival in the face of modern public
opinion was thought to be impossible. In this regard at
least a sad delusion was certainly entertained. Governments
and ministries no longer buy the raw material of legislation; ---
at least not openly or with cash in hand. The same cannot
be said of individuals and corporations; for they have of late
not infrequently found the supply of legislators in the market
even in excess of the demand. Judicial venality and ruffianism
on the bench were not long since traditions of a remote
past. Bacon was impeached, and Jeffries achieved an immortal
infamy for offences against good morals and common decency
which a self-satisfied civilization believed incompatible
with modern development. Recent revelations have cast
more than doubt upon the correctness even of this assumption.[^/2]


[^/1]: From the North American Review for July, 1869.


[^/2]: _See_ a very striking article entitled "The New York City Judiciary" in
the North American Review for July, 1867. This paper, which, from its fearless
denunciation of a class of judicial delinquencies which have since greatly
increased both in frequency and in magnitude, attracted great attention
when it was published, has been attributed to the pen of Mr. Thomas G.
Shearman, of the New York bar.

No better illustration of the fantastic disguises which the
worst and most familiar evils of history assume as they meet
us in the actual movements of our own day could be afforded
than was seen in the events attending what are known as the
Eric wars of the year 1868. Beginning in February and lasting
until December, raging fiercely in the late winter and
spring, and dying away into a hollow truce at midsummer,
only to revive into new and more vigorous life in the autumn,
this strange conflict convulsed the money market, occupied
the courts, agitated legislatures, and perplexed the country,
throughout the entire year. These, too, were but its more direct
and immediate manifestations. The remote political complications
and financial disturbances occasioned by it would
afford a curious illustration of the close intertwining of interests
which now extends throughout the civilized world. The
complete history of these proceedings cannot be written, for
the end is not yet ; indeed, such a history probably never will
be written, and yet it is still more probable that the events it
would record can never be quite forgotten. It was something
new to see a knot of adventurers, men of broken fortune,
without character and without credit, possess themselves of
an artery of commerce more important than was ever the
Appian Way, and make levies, not only upon it for their own
emolument, but, through it, upon the whole business of a
nation. Nor could it fail to be seen that this was by no
means in itself an end, but rather only a beginning. No people
can afford to glance at these things in the columns of the
daily press, and then dismiss them from memory. For Americans
they involve many questions; they touch very nearly
the foundations of common truth and honesty without which
that healthy public opinion cannot exist which is the life's
breath of our whole political system.

## I

The history of the Erie Railway has been a checkered one.
Chartered in 1832, and organized in 1833, the cost of its construction
was then estimated at three millions of dollars, of
which but one million were subscribed. By the time the first
report was made the estimated cost had increased to six
millions, and the work of construction was actually begun
on the strength of stock subscriptions of a million and a
half, and a loan of three millions from the State. In 1842
the estimated cost had increased to twelve millions and a half,
and both means in hand and credit were wholly exhausted.
Subscription-books were opened, but no names were entered
in them; the city of New York was applied to, and refused a
loan of its credit; again the legislature was besieged, but the
aid from this quarter was now hampered with inadmissible
conditions ; accordingly work was suspended, and the property
of the insolvent corporation passed into the hands of assignees.
In 1845 the State came again to the rescue; it surrendered
all claim to the three millions it had already lent to the
company; and one half of their old subscriptions having been
given up by the stockholders, and a new subscription of three
millions raised, the whole property of the road was mortgaged
for three millions more. At last, in 1851, eighteen years after
its commencement, the road was opened from Lake Erie to
tide-water. Its financial troubles had, however, as yet only
begun, for in 1859 it could not meet the interest on its mortgages,
and passed into the hands of a receiver. In 1861 an
arrangement of interests was effected, and a new company
was organized. The next year the old New York & Erie Railroad
Company disappeared under a foreclosure of the fifth
mortgage, and the present Erie Railway Company rose from
its ashes. Meanwhile the original estimate of three millions
had developed into an actual outlay of fifty millions; the 470
miles of track opened in 1842 had expanded into 773 miles in
1868; and the revenue, which the projectors had "confidently"
estimated. at something less than two millions in 1833,
amounted to over five millions when the road passed into the
hands of a receiver in 1859, and in 1865 reached the enormous
sum of sixteen millions and a half. The road was, in
truth, a magnificent enterprise, worthy to connect the great
lakes with the great seaport of America. Scaling lofty mountain
ranges, running through fertile valleys and by the banks
of broad rivers, connecting the Hudson, the Susquehanna, the
St. Lawrence, and the Ohio, it stood forth a monument at
once of engineering skill and of commercial enterprise.

The series of events in the Erie history which culminated
in the struggle about to be narrated may be said to have had
its origin some seventeen or eighteen years before, when Mr.
Daniel Drew first made his appearance in the Board of Directors,
where he remained down to the year 1868, generally
holding also the office of treasurer of the corporation. Mr.
Drew is what is known as a self-made man. Born in the year
1797, as a boy he drove cattle down from his native town of
Carmel, in Putnam County, to the market of New York City,
and, subsequently, was for years proprietor of the Bull's Head
Tavern. Like his contemporary, and ally or opponent, --- as
the case might be, --- Cornelius Vanderbilt, he built up his
fortunes in the steamboat interest, and subsequently extended
his operations over the rapidly developing railroad system.
Shrewd, unscrupulous, and very illiterate, --- a strange combination
of superstition and faithlessness, of daring and timidity,
--- often good-natured and sometimes generous, --- he
ever regarded his fiduciary position of director in a railroad as
a means of manipulating its stock for his own advantage.
For years he had been the leading bear of Wall Street, and
his favorite haunts were the secret recesses of Erie. As treasurer
of that corporation, he had, in its frequently recurring
hours of need, advanced it sums which it could not have obtained
elsewhere, and the obtaining of which was a necessity.
He had been at once a good friend of the road and the worst
enemy it had as yet known. His management of his favorite
stock had been cunning and recondite, and his ways inscrutable.
Those who sought to follow him, and those who sought
to oppose him, alike found food for sad reflection; until at last
he won for himself the expressive sobriquet of the Speculative
Director. Sometimes, though rarely, he suffered greatly in
the complications of Wall Street; more frequently he inflicted
severe damage upon others. On the whole, however, his fortunes
had greatly prospered, and the outbreak of the Erie
war found him the actual possessor of some millions, and the
reputed possessor of many more.

In the spring of 1866 Mr. Drew's manipulations of Erie
culminated in an operation which was at the time regarded as
a masterpiece; subsequent experience has, however, so improved
upon it that it is now looked upon as an ordinary and
inartistic piece of what is called "railroad financiering," a
class of operations formerly known by a more opprobrious
name. The stock of the road was then selling at about 95,
and the corporation was, as usual, in debt, and in pressing
need of money. As usual, also, it resorted to its treasurer.
Mr. Drew stood ready to make the desired advances --- upon security.
Some twenty-eight thousand shares of its own authorized
stock, which had never been issued, were at the time in
the hands of the company, which also claimed, under the statutes
of New York, the right of raising money by the issue
of bonds, convertible, at the option of the holder, into stock.
The twenty-eight thousand unissued shares, and bonds for A
three millions of dollars, convertible into stock, were placed
by the company in the hands of its treasurer, as security for
a cash loan of $3,500,000. The negotiation had been quietly
effected, and Mr. Drew's campaign now opened. Once more
he was short of Erie. While Erie was buoyant,--- while it
steadily approximated to par, --- while speculation was rampant,
and that outside public, the delight and the prey of
Wall Street, was gradually drawn in by the fascination of
amassing wealth without labor, --- quietly and stealthily,
through his agents and brokers, the grave, desponding operatar
was daily concluding his contracts for the future delivery '
of stock at current prices. At last the hour had come. Erie
was rising, Erie was scarce, the great bear had many contracts
to fulfil, and where was he to find the stock? His victims
were not kept long in suspense. Mr. Treasurer Drew laid his
hands upon his collateral. In an instant the bonds for three
millions were converted into an equivalent amount of capital
stock, and fifty-eight thousand shares, dumped, as it were, by
the cart-load in Broad Street, made Erie as plenty as even
Drew could desire. Before the astonished bulls could rally
their faculties, the quotations had fallen from 95 to 50, and
they realized that they were hopelessly entrapped.[^/7]

The whole transaction, of course, was in no respect more
creditable than any result, supposed to be one of chance or
skill, which, in fact, is made to depend upon the sorting
of a pack of cards, the dosing of a race-horse, or the selling
out of his powers by a "walkist." But the gambler, the patron
of the turf, or the pedestrian represents, as a rule, himself
alone, and his character is generally so well understood as


[^/7]: A bull, in the slang of the stock exchange, is one who endeavors to increase
the market price of stocks, as a bear endeavors to depress it. The
bull is supposed to toss the thing up with his horns, and the bear to drag it
down with his claws. The vast majority of stock operations are pure gambling
transactions. One man agrees to deliver, at some future time, property
which he has not got, to another man who does not care to own it. It is only
one way of betting on the price at the time when the delivery should be made;
if the price rises in the mean while, the bear pays to the bull the difference
between the price agreed upon and the price to which the property has risen;
if it falls, he receives the difference from the bull. All operations, as they are
termed, of the stock exchange are directed to this depression or elevation of
stocks, with a view to the settlement of differences. A "pool" is a mere
combination of men contributing money to be used to this end, and a "corner"
is a result arrived at when one combination of gamblers, secretly holding
the whole or greater part of any stock or species of property, induces
another combination to agree to deliver a large further quantity at some future
time. When the time arrives, the second combination, if the corner succeeds,
suddenly finds itself unable to buy the amount of the stock or property necessary
to enable it to fulfil its contracts, and the first combination fixes at its
own will the price at which differences must be settled. The corner fails or
is broken, when those who agree to deliver succeed in procuring the stock or
property, and fulfilling their contracts. The argot of the exchange is, however,
a language by itself, and very difficult of explanation to the wholly
uninitiated. It can only be said that all combinations of interests and manipulations
of values are mere weapons in the hands of bulls and bears for elevating
or depressing values, with a view to the payment of differences.

to be a warning to all the world. The case of the treasurer
of a great corporation is different. He occupies a fiduciary
position. He is a trustee, --- a guardian. Vast interests are
confided to his care; every shareholder of the corporation is
his ward; if it is a railroad, the community itself is his _cestui
que trust_. But passing events, accumulating more thickly
with every year, have thoroughly corrupted the public morals
on this subject. A directorship in certain great corporations
has come to be regarded as a situation in which to make a fortune,
the possession of which is no longer dishonorable. The
method of accumulation is both simple and safe. It consists in
giving contracts as a trustee to one's self as an individual, or
in speculating in the property of one's _cestui que trust_, or in
using the funds confided to one's charge, as treasurer or otherwise,
to gamble with the real owners of those funds for their
own property, and that with cards packed in advance. The
wards themselves expect their guardians to throw the dice
against them for their own property, and are surprised, as well
as gratified, if the dice are not loaded. These proceedings,
too, are looked upon as hardly reprehensible, yet they strike
at the very foundation of existing society. The theory of representation,
whether in politics or in business, is of the essence
of modern development. Our whole system rests upon the
sanctity of the fiduciary relations. Whoever betrays them, a
director of a railroad no less than a member of Congress or
the trustee of an orphans' asylum, is the common enemy of
every man, woman, and child who lives under representative
government. The unscrupulous director is far less entitled to
mercy than the ordinary gambler, combining as he does the
character of the traitor with the acts of the thief.

No acute moral sensibility on this point, however, has for some
years troubled Wall Street, nor, indeed, the country at large.
As a result of the transaction of 1866, Mr. Drew was looked
upon as having effected a surprisingly clever operation, and he
retired from the field hated, feared, wealthy, and admired.
This episode of Wall Street history took its place as a brilliant
success beside the famous Prairie du Chien and Harlem
"corners," and, but for subsequent events, would soon have
been forgotten. Its close connection, however, with more important
though later incidents of Erie history seems likely to
preserve its memory fresh. Great events were impending; a
new man was looming up in the railroad world, introducing
novel ideas and principles, and it could hardly be that the
new and old would not come in conflict. Cornelius Vanderbilt,
commonly known as Commodore Vanderbilt, was now developing
his theory of the management of railroads.

Born in the year 1794, Vanderbilt was a somewhat older
man than Drew. There are several points of resemblance in
the early lives of the two men, and many points of curious
contrast in their characters. Vanderbilt, like Drew, was born
in very humble circumstances in the State of New York, and
like him also received little education. He began life by ferrying
passengers and produce from Staten Island to New York
City. Subsequently, he too laid the foundation of his great
fortune in the growing steamboat navigation, and likewise, in
due course of time, transferred himself to the railroad interest.
When at last, in 1868, the two came into collision as
representatives of the old system of railroad management and
of the new, they were each threescore and ten years of age,
and had both been successful in the accumulation of millions,
--- Vanderbilt even more so than Drew. They were probably
equally unscrupulous and equally selfish; but, while the cast
of Drew's mind was sombre and bearish, Vanderbilt was gay
and buoyant of temperament, little given to thoughts other
than of this world, a lover of horses and of the good things
of life. The first affects prayer-meetings, and the last is a
devotee of whist. Drew, in Wall Street, is by temperament
a bear, while Vanderbilt could hardly be other than a bull.
Vanderbilt must be allowed to be by far the superior man of
the two. Drew is astute and full of resources, and at all times
a dangerous opponent; but Vanderbilt takes larger, more
comprehensive views, and his mind has a vigorous grasp which
that of Drew seems to want. While, in short, in a wider
field, the one might have made himself a great and successful
despot, the other would hardly have aspired beyond the control
of the jobbing department of some corrupt government.
Accordingly, while in Drew's connection with the railroad system
his operations and manipulations evince no qualities calculated
to excite even a vulgar admiration or respect, it is
impossible to regard Vanderbilt's methods or aims without recognizing
the magnitude of the man's ideas and conceding his
abilities. He involuntarily excites feelings of admiration for
himself and alarm for the public. His ambition is a great
one. It seems to be nothing less than to make himself master
in his own right of the great channels of communication
which connect the city of New York with the interior of the
continent, and to control them as his private property. Drew
sought to carry to a mean perfection the old system of operating
successfully from the confidential position of director, neither
knowing anything nor caring anything for the railroad system,
except in its connection with the movements of the stock
exchange, and he succeeded in his object. Vanderbilt, on the
other hand, as selfish, harder, and more dangerous, though less
subtle, has by instinct, rather than by intellectual effort, seen
the full magnitude of the system, and through it has sought
to make himself a dictator in modern civilization, moving forward
to this end step by step with a sort of pitiless energy
which has seemed to have in it an element of fate. As trade
now dominates the world, and railways dominate trade, his object
has been to make himself the virtual master of all by
making himself absolute lord of the railways. Had he begun
his railroad operations with this end in view, complete failure
would have been almost certainly his reward. Commencing
as he did, however, with a comparatively insignificant objective
point, --- the cheap purchase of a bankrupt stock, --- and
developing his ideas as he advanced, his power and his reputation
grew, until an end which at first it would have seemed
madness to entertain became at last both natural and feasible.

Two great lines of railway traverse the State of New York
and connect it with the West, --- the Erie and the New York
Central. The latter communicates with the city by a great
river and by two railroads. To get these two roads --- the
Harlem and the Hudson River --- under his own absolute control,
and then, so far as the connection with the Central was
concerned, to abolish the river, was Vanderbilt's immediate
object. First making himself master of the Harlem road, he
there learned his early lessons in railroad management, and
picked up a fortune by the way. A few years ago Harlem
had no value. As late as 1860 it sold for eight or nine
dollars per share; and in January, 1863, when Vanderbilt
had got the control, it had risen only to 30. By July of
that year it stood at 92, and in August was suddenly raised
by a "corner" to 179. The next year witnessed a similar
operation. The stock which sold in January at less than
90 was settled for in June in the neighborhood of 285. On
one of these occasions Mr. Drew is reported to have contributed
a sum approaching half a million to his rival's wealth.
More recently the stock had been floated at about 130. It
was in the successful conduct of this first experiment that
Vanderbilt showed his very manifest superiority over previous
railroad managers. The Harlem was, after all, only a competing
line, and competition was proverbially the rock ahead in
all railroad enterprise. The success of Vanderbilt with the
Harlem depended upon his getting rid of the competition of
the Hudson River railroad. An ordinary manager would
have resorted to contracts, which are never carried out, or to
opposition, which is apt to be ruinous. Vanderbilt, on the
contrary, put an end to competition by buying up the competing
line. This he did at about par, and, in due course of
time, the stock was sent up to 180. Thus his plans had developed
by another step, while through a judicious course of
financiering and watering and dividing, a new fortune had
been secured by him. By this time Vanderbilt's reputation as
a railroad manager --- as one who earned dividends, created
stock, and invented wealth --- had become very great, and the
managers of the Central brought that road to him, and asked
him to do with it as he had done with the Harlem and Hudson
River. He accepted the proffered charge, and now, probably,
the possibilities of his position and the magnitude of
the prize within his grasp at last dawned on his mind. Unconsciously
to himself, working more wisely than he knew, he
had developed to its logical conclusion one potent element of
modern civilization.

Gravitation is the rule, and centralization the natural consequence,
in society no less than in physics. Physically, morally,
intellectually, in population, wealth, and intelligence, all
things tend to concentration. One singular illustration of this
law is almost entirely the growth of this century. Formerly,
either governments, or individuals, or, at most, small combinations
of individuals, were the originators of all great works
of public utility. Within the present century only has democracy
found its way through the representative system into
the combinations of capital, small shareholders combining to
carry out the most extensive enterprises. And yet already
our great corporations are fast emancipating themselves from
the State, or rather subjeeting the State to their own control,
while individual capitalists, who long ago abandoned the attempt
to compete with them, will next seek to control them.
In this dangerous path of centralization Vanderbilt has taken
the latest step in advance. He has combined the natural
power of the individual with the factitious power of the corporation.
The famous "L'état, c'est moi" of Louis XIV. represents
Vanderbilt's position in regard to his railroads. Unconsciously
he has introduced Cæsarism into corporate life.
He has, however, but pointed out the way which others will
tread. The individual will hereafter be engrafted on the corporation,
--- democracy running its course, and resulting in imperialism;
and Vanderbilt is but the precursor of a class of
men who will wield within the State a power created by the State,
but too great for its control. He is the founder of a dynasty.

From the moment Vanderbilt stepped into the management
of the Central, but a single effort seemed necessary to give
the new railroad king absolute control over the railroad system,
and consequently over the commerce, of New York. By
advancing only one step he could securely levy his tolls on
the traffic of a continent. Nor could this step have seemed
difficult to take. It was but to repeat with the Erie his successful
operation with the Hudson River road. Not only was
it a step easy to take, but here again, as so many times before,
a new fortune seemed ready to drop into his hand. The Erie
might well yield a not less golden harvest than the Central,
Hudson River, or Harlem. There was indeed but one obstacle
in the way, --- the plan might not meet the views of the
one man who at that time possessed the wealth, cunning,
and combination of qualities which could defeat it, that man
being the Speculative Director of the Erie, --- Mr. Daniel
Drew.

The New York Central passed into Vanderbilt's hands in
the winter of 1866--67, and he marked the Erie for his own
in the succeeding autumn. As the annual meeting of the corporation
approached, three parties were found in the field contending
for control of the road. One party was represented
by Drew, and might be called the party in possession, that
which had long ruled the Erie, and made it what it was, ---
the Scarlet Woman of Wall Street. Next came Vanderbilt,
flushed with success, and bent upon fully gratifying his great
instinct for developing imperialism in corporate life. Lastly,
a faction made its appearance composed of some shrewd and
ambitious Wall Street operators and of certain persons from
Boston, who sustained for the occasion the novel character of
railroad reformers. This party, it is needless to say, was as
unscrupulous, and, as the result proved, as able as either of
the others; it represented nothing but a raid made upon the
Erie treasury in the interest of a thoroughly bankrupt New
England corporation, of which its members had the control.
The history of this corporation, known as the Boston, Hartford,
& Erie Railroad, --- a projected feeder and connection of
the Erie, --- would be one curious to read, though very difficult
to write. Its name was synonymous with bankruptcy, litigation,
fraud, and failure. If the Erie was of doubtful repute
in Wall Street, the Boston, Hartford, & Erie had long been
of worse than doubtful repute in State Street. Of late years,
under able and persevering, if not scrupulous management,
the bankrupt, moribund company had been slowly struggling
into new life, and in the spring of 1867 it had obtained, under
certain conditions, from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
a subsidy in aid of the construction of its road. One
of the conditions imposed obliged the corporation to raise a
sum from other sources still larger than that granted by the
State. Accordingly, those having the line in charge looked
abroad for a victim, and fixed their eyes upon the Erie.

As the election day drew near, Erie was of course for sale.
A controlling interest of stockholders stood ready to sell their
proxies, with entire impartiality, to any of the three contending
parties, or to any man who would pay the market price for
them. Nay, more, the attorney of one of the contending parties,
as it afterwards appeared, after an ineffectual effort to
extort black mail, actually sold the proxies of his principal to
another of the contestants, and his doing so seemed to excite
mirth rather than surprise. Meanwhile the representatives
of the Eastern interest played their part to admiration. Taking
advantage of some Wall Street complications just then existing
between Vanderbilt and Drew, they induced the former
to ally himself with them, and the latter saw that his defeat
was inevitable. Even at this time the Vanderbilt party contemplated
having recourse, if necessary, to the courts, and a
petition for an injunction had been prepared, setting forth the
details of the "corner" of 1866. On the Sunday preceding
the election Drew, in view of his impending defeat, called
upon Vanderbilt. That gentleman, thereupon, very amicably
read to him the legal documents prepared for his benefit ;
whereupon the ready treasurer at once turned about, and,
having hitherto been hampering the Commodore by his bear
operations, he now agreed to join hands with him in giving to
the market a strong upward tendency. Meanwhile the other
parties to the contest were not idle. At the same house, at a
later hour in the day, Vanderbilt explained to the Eastern adventurers
his new plan of operations, which included the continuance
of Drew in his directorship. These gentlemen were
puzzled, not to say confounded, by this sudden change of front.
An explanation was demanded, some plain language followed,
and the parties separated, leaving everything unsettled; but
only to meet again at a later hour at the house of Drew.
There Vanderbilt brought the new men to terms by proposing
to Drew a bold _coup de main_, calculated to throw them entirely
out of the direction. Before the parties separated that
night a written agreement had been entered into, providing
that, to save appearances, the new board should be elected
without Drew, but that immediately thereafter a vacancy
should be created, and Drew chosen to fill it. He was therefore
to go in as one of two directors in the Vanderbilt interest,
that gentleman's nephew, Mr. Work, being the other.

This programme was faithfully carried out, and on the 2d
of October Wall Street was at once astonished by the news of
the defeat of the notorious leader of the bears, and bewildered
by the immediate resignation of a member of the new board
and the election of Drew in his place. Apparently he had
given in his submission, the one obstacle to success was removed,
and the ever-victorious Commodore had now but to
close his fingers on his new prize. Virtual consolidation in
the Vanderbilt interest seemed a foregone conclusion.

The reinstalment of Drew was followed by a period of hollow
truce. A combination of capitalists, in pursuance of an
arrangement already referred to, took advantage of this to
transfer as much as possible of the spare cash of the "outside
public" from its pockets to their own. A "pool" was formed,
in view of the depressed condition.of Erie, and Drew was left
to manipulate the market for the advantage of those whom
it might concern. The result of the Speculative Director's
operations supplied a curious commentary on the ethics of the
stock exchange, and made it questionable whether the ancient
adage as to honor among a certain class in society is of universal
application, or confined to its more persecuted members.
One contributor to the "pool," in this instance, was Mr. ---
a friend of Vanderbilt. The ways of Mr. Drew were, as usual,
past finding out; Mr. --- , however, grew impatient of waiting
for the anticipated rise in Erie, and it occurred to him
that, besides participating in the profits of the "pool," he
might as well turn an honest penny by collateral operations
on his own account, looking to the expected rise. Before embarking
on his independent venture, however, he consulted
Mr. Drew, it is said, who entirely declined to express any
judgment as to the enterprise, but at the same time agreed to
loan Mr. --- out of the "pool" any moneys he might require
upon the security usual in such cases. Mr. --- availed
himself of the means thus put at his disposal, and laid in
a private stock of Erie. Still, however, the expected rise
did not take place. Again he applied to Mr. Drew for information,
but with no better success than before; and again,
tempted by the cheapness of Erie, he borrowed further funds
of the "pool," and made new purchases of stock. At last
the long-continued depression of Erie aroused a dreadful suspicion
in the bull operator, and inquiries were set on foot.
He then discovered, to his astonishment and horror, that his
stock had come to him through certain of the brokers of Mr.
Drew. The members of the "pool" were at once called together,
and Mr. Drew was appealed to on behalf of Mr. ---
It was suggested to him that it would be well to run Erie up
to aid a confederate. Thereupon, with all the coolness imaginable,
Mr. Drew announced that the "pool" had no Erie and
wanted no Erie; that it had sold out its Erie and had realized
large profits, which he now proposed to divide. Thereafter
who could pretend to understand Daniel Drew? who could
fail to appreciate the humors of Wall Street? The controller
of the "pool" had actually lent the money of the "pool" to
one of the members of the "pool," to enable him to buy up
the stock of the "pool"; and having thus quietly saddled
him with it, the controller proceeded to divide the profits,
and calmly returned to the victim a portion of his own money
as his share of the proceeds. Yet, strange to say, Mr. ---
wholly failed to see the humorous side of the transaction, and
actually feigned great indignation.

This, however, was a mere sportive interlude between the
graver scenes of the drama. The real conflict was now impending.
Commodore Vanderbilt stretched out his hand to
grasp Erie. Erie was to be isolated and shut up within the
limits of New York; it was to be given over, bound hand and
foot, to the lord of the Central. To perfect this programme,
the representatives of all the competing lines met, and a proposition
was submitted to the Erie party looking to a practical
consolidation on certain terms of the Pennsylvania Central,
the Erie, and the New York Central, and a division among the
contracting parties of all the earnings from the New York
City travel. A new illustration was thus to be afforded, at
the expense of the trade and travel to and from the heart of
a continent, of George Stephenson's famous aphorism, that
where combination is possible competition is impossible. The
Erie party, however, represented that their road earned more
than half of the fund of which they were to receive only one
third. They remonstrated and proposed modifications, but
their opponents were inexorable. The terms were too hard;
the conference led to no result; a ruinous competition seemed
impending as the alternative to a fierce war of doubtful issue.
Both parties now retired to their camps, and mustered their
forces in preparation for the first overt act of hostility. They
had not long to wait.

Vanderbilt was not accustomed to failure, and in this case
the sense of treachery, the bitter consciousness of having
been outwitted in the presence of all Wall Street, gave a peculiar
sting to the rebuff. A long succession of victories had
intensified his natural arrogance, and he was by no means disposed,
even apart from the failure of his cherished plans, to
sit down and nurse an impotent wrath in presence of an injured
prestige. Foiled in intrigue, he must now have recourse
to his favorite weapon, --- the brute force of his millions. He
therefore prepared to go out into Wall Street in his might,
and to make himself master of the Erie, as before he had
made himself master of the Hudson River road. The task
in itself was one of magnitude. The volume of stock was
immense; all of it was upon the street, and the necessary expenditure
involved many millions of dollars. The peculiar
difficulty of the task, however, lay in the fact that it had to
be undertaken in the face of antagonists so bold, so subtle, so
unscrupulous, so thoroughly acquainted with Erie, as well as
so familiar with all the devices and tricks of fence of Wall
Street, as were those who now stood ready to take up the
gage which the Commodore so arrogantly threw down.

The first open hostilities took place on the 17th of February.
For some time Wall Street had been agitated with
forebodings of the coming hostilities, but not until that day
was recourse had to the courts. Vanderbilt had two ends in
view when he sought to avail himself of the processes of law.
In the first place, Drew's long connection with Erie, and especially
the unsettled transactions arising out of the famous
corner of 1866, afforded admirable ground for annoying offensive
operations; and, in the second place, these very proceedings,
by throwing his opponent on the defensive, afforded an
excellent cover for Vanderbilt's own transactions in Wall
Street. It was essential to his success to corner Drew, but to
corner Drew at all was not easy, and to corner him in Erie
was difficult indeed. Very recent experiences, of which Vanderbilt
was fully informed, no less than the memories of 1866,
had fully warned the public how manifold and ingenious were
the expedients through which the cunning treasurer furnished
himself with Erie, when the exigencies of his position demanded
fresh supplies. It was, therefore, very necessary for
Vanderbilt that he should, while buying Erie with one hand
in Wall Street, with the other close, so far as he could, that
apparently inexhaustible spring from which such generous
supplies of new stock were wont to flow. Accordingly, on
the 17th of February, Mr. Frank Work, the only remaining
representative of the Vanderbilt faction in the Erie direction,
accompanied by Mr. Vanderbilt's attorneys, Messrs. Rapallo
and Spenser, made his appearance before Judge Barnard, of
the Supreme Court of New York, then sitting in chambers,
and applied for an injunction against Treasurer Drew and his
brother directors, of the Erie Railway, restraining them from
the payment of interest or principal of the three and a half
millions borrowed of the treasurer in 1866, as well as from
releasing Drew from any liability or cause of action the company
might have against him, pending an investigation of his
accounts as treasurer; on the other hand, Drew was to be enjoined
from taking any legal steps towards compelling a settlement.
A temporary injunction was granted in accordance
with the petition, and a further hearing was assigned for the
21st. Two days later, however, --- on the 19th of the month,
--- without waiting for the result of the first attack, the same
attorneys appeared again before Judge Barnard, and now in
the name of the people, acting through the Attorney-General,
petitioned for the removal from office of Treasurer Drew. The
papers in the case set forth some of the difficulties which beset
the Commodore, and exposed the existence of a new fountain
of Erie stock. It appeared that there was a recently enacted
statute of New York which authorized any railroad company
to create and issue its own stock in exchange for the
stock of any other road under lease to it. The petition then
alleged that Mr. Drew and certain of his brother directors,
had quietly possessed themselves of a worthless road connecting
with the Erie, and called the Buffalo, Bradford, & Pittsburg
Railroad, and had then, as occasion and their own exigencies
required, proceeded to supply themselves with whatever Erie
stock they wanted, by leasing their own road to the road of
which they were directors, and then creating stock and issuing
it to themselves, in exchange, under the authority vested in
them by law. The uncontradicted history of this transaction,
as subsequently set forth on the very doubtful authority of
a leading Erie director, affords, indeed, a most happy illustration
of brilliant railroad financiering, whether true in this
case or not. The road, it was stated, cost the purchasers, as
financiers, some $250,000; as proprietors, they then issued
in its name bonds for two million dollars, payable to one of
themselves, who now figured as trustee. This person, then,
shifting his character, drew up, as counsel for both parties, a
contract leasing this road to the Erie Railway for four hundred
and ninety-nine years, the Erie agreeing to assume the
bonds; reappearing in their original character of Erie directors,
these gentlemen then ratified the lease, and thereafter
it only remained for them to relapse into the rôle of financiers,
and to divide the proceeds. All this was happily accomplished,
and the Erie Railway lost and some one gained $ 140,000 a
year by the bargain. The skilful actors in this much-shifting
drama probably proceeded on the familiar theory that
exchange is no robbery; and the expedient was certainly
ingenious.

Such is the story of this proceeding as told under oath by
one who must have known the whole truth. That the facts
are correctly set forth by no means follows. Indeed, many
parts of this narrative are open to this criticism. The evidence
on which it is founded may be sufficiently clear, but unfortunately
the witnesses are not seldom wholly unworthy of
credence. The formality of an oath may accompany plausible
statements without giving to them the slightest additional
weight. In this case the sworn allegations were made, and
they implicated certain respectable men; it can only be said
of them that their falsehood is not patent, and that they are
thoroughly in character with other transactions known to be
true. If the facts of the case were correctly stated, or had in
them an element of truth, it is difficult to see what fiduciary
relation these directors, as trustees, did not violate. However
this may be, it is indisputable that the supply of Erie on
the market had been largely increased from the source indicated,
and Commodore Vanderbilt naturally desired to put
some limit to the amount of the stock in existence, a majority
of which he sought to control. Accordingly it was now further
ordered by Mr. Justice Barnard that Mr. Drew should
show cause on the 21st why the prayer of the petitioner
should not be granted, and meanwhile he was temporarily
suspended from his position as treasurer and director.

It was not until the 3d of March, however, that any decisive
action was taken by Judge Barnard on either of the petitions
before him. Even then, that in the name of the Attorney-General
was postponed for final hearing until the 10th of
the month; but, on the application of Work, an injunction was
issued restraining the Erie board from any new issue of capital
stock, by conversion of bonds or otherwise, in addition to the
251,058 shares appearing in the previous reports of the road,
and forbidding the guaranty by the Erie of the bonds of any
connecting line of road. While this last provision of the
order was calculated to furnish food for thought to the Boston
party, matter for meditation was supplied to Mr. Drew by
other clauses, which specially forbade him, his agents, attorneys,
or brokers, to have any transactions in Erie, or fulfil any
of his contracts already entered into, until he had returned to
the company sixty-eight thousand shares of capital stock, alleged
to be the number involved in the unsettled transaction
of 1866, and the more recent Buffalo, Bradford, & Pittsburg
exchange. A final hearing was fixed for the 10th of March on
both injunctions.

Things certainly did not now promise well for Treasurer
Drew and the bear party. Vanderbilt and the bulls seemed
to arrange everything to meet their own views; apparently
they had but to ask and it was granted. If any virtue existed
in the processes of law, if any authority was wielded by
a New York court, it now seemed as if the very head of the
bear faction must needs be converted into a bull in his own
despite, and to his manifest ruin. He, in this hour of his
trial, was to be forced by his triumphant opponent to make
Erie scarce by returning into its treasury sixty-eight thousand
shares,--- one fourth of its whole capital stock of every decription.
So far from manufacturing fresh Erie and pouring
it into the street, he was to be cornered by a writ, and forced
to work his own ruin in obedience to an injunction. Appearances
are, however, proverbially deceptive, and all depended on
the assumption that some virtue did exist in the processes of
law, and that some authority was wielded by a New York
court. In spite of the threatening aspect of his affairs, it
was very evident that the nerves of Mr. Drew and his associates
were not seriously affected. Wall Street watched him
with curiosity not unmingled with alarm; for this was a conflict
of Titans. Hedged all around with orders of the court,
suspended, enjoined, and threatened with all manner of unheard-of
processes, with Vanderbilt's wealth standing like a
lion in his path, and all Wall Street ready to turn upon him
and rend him, --- in presence of all these accumulated terrors.
of the court-room and of the exchange, the Speculative
Director was not less speculative than was his wont. He
seemed rushing on destruction. Day after day he pursued the
same "short"[^/22] tactics; contract after contract was put out for
the future delivery of stock at current prices, and this, too, in
the face of a continually rising market. Evidently he did not
yet consider himself at the end of his resources.

It was equally evident, however, that he had not much time
to lose. It was now the 3d of March, and the anticipated
"corner" might be looked for about the 10th. As usual,
some light skirmishing took place as a prelude to the heavy
shock of decisive battle. The Erie party very freely and
openly expressed a decided lack of respect, and something
approaching contempt, for the purity of that particular fragment
of the judicial ermine which was supposed to adorn the
person of Mr. Justice Barnard. They did not pretend to conceal
their conviction that this magistrate was a piece of the
Vanderbilt property, and they very plainly announced their
intention of seeking for justice elsewhere. With this end in
view they betook themselves to their own town of Binghamton,
in the county of Broome, where they duly presented
themselves before Mr. Justice Balcom, of the Supreme Court.
The existing judicial system of New York divides the State
into eight distinct districts, each of which has an independent
Supreme Court of four judges, elected by the citizens of that
district. The first district alone enjoys five judges, the fifth
being the Judge Barnard already referred to. These local
judges, however, are clothed with certain equity powers in
actions commenced before them, which run throughout the
State. As one subject of litigation, therefore, might affect
many individuals, each of whom might initiate legal proceedings
before any of the thirty-three judges; which judge,
again, might forbid proceedings before any or all of the other
judges, or issue a stay of proceedings in suits already commenced,
and then proceed to make orders, to consolidate
actions, and to issue process for contempt, --- it was not improbable
that, sooner or later, strange and disgraceful conflicts
of authority would arise, and that the law would fall into contempt.
Such a system can, in fact, be sustained only so long
as co-ordinate judges use the delicate powers of equity with a
careful regard to private rights and the dignity of the law,
and therefore, more than any which has ever been devised,
it calls for a high average of learning, dignity, and personal
character in the occupants of the bench. When, therefore,
the ermine of the judge is flung into the kennel of party
politics and becomes a part of the spoils of political victory;
when by any chance partisanship, brutality, and corruption
become the qualities which especially recommend the successful
aspirant to judicial honors, then the system described will
be found to furnish peculiar facilities for the display of these
characteristics.


[^/22]: An operator is said to be "short" when he has agreed to deliver that
which he has not got. He wagers, in fact, on a fall.

Taking advantage of the occasion this system, so simple in
theory, so complicated in practice, afforded for creating complications
by obtaining conflicting orders from co-ordinate
judges, the Erie party broke ground in a new suit. The injunction
was no sooner asked of Judge Balcom than it was
granted, and Mr. Frank Work, the Attorney-General, and all
other parties litigant, were directed to show cause at Cortlandville
on the 7th of March; and, meanwhile, Mr. Director
Work, accused of being a spy in the councils of Erie, was
temporarily suspended from his position, and all proceedings
in the suits commenced before Judge Barnard were stayed.
The moment, however, this order became known in New York,
a new suit was commenced by the Vanderbilt interest in the
name of Richard Schell; an urban judge cried check to the
move of the rural judge, by forbidding any meeting of the
Erie board, or the transaction of any business by it, unless
Director Work was at full liberty to participate therein. The
first move of the Drew faction did not seem likely to result in
any signal advantage to its cause.

All this, however, was mere skirmishing, and now the decisive
engagement was near at hand. The plans of the Erie
ring were matured, and, if Commodore Vanderbilt wanted the
stock of their road, they were prepared to let him have all he
desired. As usual the Erie treasury was at this time deficient
in funds. As usual, also, Daniel Drew stood ready to advance
all the funds required. --- on proper security. One kind of security,
and only one, the company was disposed at this time to
offer, --- its convertible bonds under a pledge of conversion.
The company could not issue stock outright, in any case, at
less than par; its bonds bore interest, and were useless on the
street; an issue of convertible bonds was another name for
an issue of stock to be sold at market rates. The treasurer
readily agreed to find a purchaser, and, in fact, he himself
stood just then in pressing need of some scores of thousands
of shares. Already at the meeting of the Board of Directors,
on the 19th of February, a very deceptive account of the condition
of the road, jockied out of the general superintendent,
had been read and made public; the increased depot facilities,
the projected double track, and the everlasting steel rails, had
been made to do vigorous duty; and the board had, in the
vaguest and most general language conceivable, clothed the
Executive Committee with full power in the premises.[^/24] Immediately
after the Board of Directors adjourned a meeting
of the Executive Committee was held, and a vote to issue at
once convertible bonds for ten millions gave a meaning to the
very ambiguous language of the directors' resolve; and thus,
when apparently on the very threshold of his final triumph,
this mighty mass of one hundred thousand shares of new
stock was hanging like an avalanche over the head of Vanderbilt.


[^/24]: This vote of the Board of Directors of the Erie Railway Company was
the sole authority under which, without further consultation with the board,
the stock of the road was increased four hundred and fifty thousand shares.
It was worded as follows:---

"It being necessary for the finishing, completing, and operating the road of
the company, to borrow money,

"Resolved, That under the provisions of the statute authorizing the loan of
money for such purposes, the Executive Committee be authorized to borrow
such sum as may be necessary, and to issue therefor such security as is provided
for in such cases by the laws of this State; and that the president and
secretary be authorized, under the seal of the company, to execute all needful
and proper agreements and undertakings for such purpose."

The law referred to was Subdivision 10 of Section 28 of the General Railroad
Act of 1850, which authorized the railroad companies to which it applied
"to borrow such sums of money as may be necessary for completing, finishing,
and operating the road "; to mortgage their roads as security for such loans;
and to "confer on any holder of any bond issued for money borrowed as aforesaid,
the right to convert the principal due or owing thereon into stock of said
company, at any time, not exceeding ten years from the date of the bond,
under such regulations as the directors may see fit to adopt."

It was an open question whether this law applied at all to the Erie Railway
Company, the amount of the capital stock of which was otherwise regulated
by law; the bonds were issued and sold, not as bonds, but with a distinct
pledge of immediate conversion into stock, and as an indirect way of doing
that, the direct doing of which was clearly illegal; finally, as a matter of fact,
the proceeds of these bonds were not used for "completing, finishing, or operating
the road." As a matter of law the question is of no interest outside of
New York, and is as yet undecided there. Of the good faith and morality of
the transaction but one opinion exists anywhere.

The Executive Committee had voted to sell the entire
amount of these bonds at not less than 72. Five millions
were placed upon the market at once, and Mr. Drew's broker
became the purchaser, Mr. Drew giving him a written guaranty
against loss, and being entitled to any profit. It
was all done in ten minutes after the committee adjourned,---
the bonds issued, their conversion into stock demanded and
complied with, and certificates for fifty thousand shares deposited
in the broker's safe, subject to the orders of Daniel Drew.
There they remained until the 29th, when they were issued,
on his requisition, to certain others of that gentleman's army
of brokers, much as ammunition might be issued before a general
engagement. Three days later came the Barnard injunction,
and Erie suddenly rose in the market. Then it was
determined to bring up the reserves and let the eager bulls
have the other five millions. The history of this second issue
was, in all respects, an episode worthy of Erie, and deserves
minute relation. It was decided upon on the 3d, but before the
bonds were converted Barnard's injunction had been served on
every one connected with the Erie Road or with Daniel Drew.
The 10th was the return day of the writ, but the Erie operators
needed even less time for their deliberations. Monday,
the 9th, was settled upon as the day upon which to defeat the
impending "corner." The night of Saturday, the 7th, was a
busy one in the Erie camp. While one set of counsel and
clerks were preparing affidavits and prayers for strange writs
and injunctions, the enjoined vice-president of the road was busy
at home signing certificates of stock, to be ready for instant
use in case a modification of the injunction could be obtained,
and another set of counsel was in immediate attendance on
the leaders themselves. Mr. Groesbeck, the chief of the Drew
brokers, being himself enjoined, secured elsewhere, after one
or two failures, a purchaser of the bonds, and took him to the
house of the Erie counsel, where Drew and other directors and
brokers then were. There the terms of the nominal sale were
agreed upon, and a contract was drawn up transferring the
bonds to this man of straw, who in return gave Mr. Drew a
full power of attorney to convert or otherwise dispose of the
bonds, in the form of a promissory note for their purchasemoney;
Mr. Groesbeck, meanwhile, with the fear of injunctions
before his eyes, prudently withdrew into the next room, and
amused himself by looking at the curiosities and conversing
with the lawyers' young gentlemen. After the contract was
closed, the purchaser was asked to sign an affidavit setting
forth his ownership of the bonds and the refusal of the corporation
to convert them into stock in compliance with their
contract, upon which affidavit it was in contemplation to seek
from some justice a writ of _mandamus_ to compel the Erie
Railway to convert them, the necessary papers for such a proceeding
being then in course of preparation elsewhere. This
the purchaser declined to do. One of the lawyers present
then said: "Well, you can make the demand now; here is
Mr. Drew, the treasurer of the company, and Mr. Gould, one

of the Executive Committee." In accordance with this suggestion
a demand for the stock was then made, and, of course,
at once refused; thereupon the scruples of the man of straw
being all removed, the desired affidavit was signed. All business
now being finished, the parties separated; the legal
papers were ready, the convertible bonds had been disposed
of, and the certificates of stock, for which they were to be
exchanged, were signed in blank and ready for delivery.

Early Monday morning the Erie people were at work. Mr.
Drew, the director and treasurer, had agreed to sell on that
day fifty thousand shares of the stock, at 80, to the firms of
which Mr. Fisk and Mr. Gould were members, these gentlemen
also being Erie directors and members of the Executive
Committee. The new certificates, made out in the names of
these firms on Saturday night, were in the hands of the secretary
of the company, who was strictly enjoined from allowing
their issue. On Monday morning this official directed an
employee of the road to carry these books of certificates from
the West Street office of the company to the transfer clerk in
Pine Street, and there to deliver them carefully. The messenger
left the room, but immediately returned empty-handed,
and informed the astonished secretary that Mr. Fisk had met
him outside the door, taken from him the books of unissued
certificates, and "run away with them." It was true; --- one
essential step towards conversion had been taken; the certificates
of stock were beyond the control of an injunction. During
the afternoon of the same day the convertible bonds were
found upon the secretary's desk, where they had been placed
by Mr. Belden, the partner in business of Director James Fisk,
Jr.; the certificates were next seen in Broad Street.

Before launching the bolt thus provided, the conspirators
had considered it not unadvisable to cover their proceedings,
if they could, with some form of law. This probably was
looked upon as an idle ceremony, but it could do no harm;
and perhaps their next step was dictated by what has been
called "a decent respect for the opinions of mankind," combined
with a profound contempt for judges and courts of
law.

Early on the morning of the 9th Judge Gilbert, a highly
respected magistrate of the Second Judicial District, residing
in Brooklyn, was waited upon by one of the Erie counsel, who
desired to initiate before him a new suit in the Erie litigation,
--- this time, in the name of the Saturday evening purchaser of
bonds and maker of affidavits. A writ of _mandamus_ was asked
for. This writ clearly did not lie in such a case; the magistrate
very properly declined to grant it, and the only wonder is that
counsel should have applied for it. New counsel were then
hurriedly summoned, and a new petition, in a fresh name, was
presented. This petition was for an injunction, in the name
of Belden, the partner of Mr. Fisk, and the documents then
and there presented were probably as eloquent an exposure as
could possibly have been penned of the lamentable condition
into which the once honored judiciary of New York had fallen.
The petition alleged that some time in February certain persons,
among whom was especially named George G. Barnard,
--- the justice of the Supreme Court of the First District,---
had entered into a combination to speculate in the stock of
the Erie Railway, and to use the process of the courts for the
purpose of aiding their speculation; "and that, in furtherance
of the plans of this combination," the actions in Work's
name had been commenced before Barnard, who, the counsel
asserted, was then issuing injunctions at the rate of half a,
dozen a day. It is impossible by any criticism to do justice
to such audacity as this: the dumb silence of amazement is
the only fitting commentary. Apparently, however, nothing
that could be stated of his colleague across the river exceeded
the belief of Judge Gilbert, for, after some trifling delays and
a few objections on the part of the judge to the form of the
desired order, the Erie counsel hurried away, and returned to
New York with a new injunction, restraining all the parties to
all the other suits from further proceedings, and from doing
any acts in "furtherance of said conspiracy"; --- in one paragraph
ordering the Erie directors, except Work, to continue
in the discharge of their duties, in direct defiance of the injunction
of one judge, and in the next, with an equal disregard
of another judge, forbidding the directors to desist from
converting bonds into stock. Judge Gilbert having, a few
hours before signing this wonderful order, refused to issue a
writ of _mandamus_, it may be proper to add that the process
of equity here resorted to, compelling the performance of
various acts, is of recent invention, and is known as a "mandatory
injunction."

All was now ready. The Drew party were enjoined in
every direction. One magistrate had forbidden them to move,
and another magistrate had ordered them not to stand still.
If the Erie board held meetings and transacted business, it
violated one injunction; if it abstained from doing so, it violated
another. By the further conversion of bonds into stock
pains and penalties would be incurred at the hands of Judge
Barnard; the refusal to convert would be an act of disobedience
to Judge Gilbert. Strategically considered, the position
could not be improved, and Mr. Drew and his friends were
not the men to let the golden moment escape them. At once,
before a new injunction could be obtained, even in New York,
fifty thousand shares of new Erie stock were flung upon the
market. That day Erie was buoyant, --- Vanderbilt was purchasing.
His agents caught at the new stock as eagerly as at
the old, and the whole of it was absorbed before its origin
was suspected, and almost without a falter in the price. Then
the fresh certificates appeared, and the truth became known.
Erie had that day opened at 80 and risen rapidly to 83, while
its rise even to par was predicted; suddenly it faltered, fell
off, and then dropped suddenly to 71. Wall Street had never
been subjected to a greater shock, and the market reeled to and
fro like a drunken man between these giants, as they hurled
about shares by the tens of thousands, and money by the million.
When night put an end to the conflict, Erie stood at
78, the shock of battle was over, and the astonished brokers
drew breath as they waited for the events of the morrow.
The attempted "corner" was a failure, and Drew was victorious,
--- no doubt existed on that point. The question now
was, could Vanderbilt sustain himself? In spite of all his
wealth, must he not go down before his cunning opponent
?

The morning of the 11th found the Erie leaders still transacting
business at the office of the corporation in West Street.
It would seem that these gentlemen, in spite of the glaring
contempt for the process of the courts of which they had been
guilty, had made no arrangements for an orderly retreat beyond
the jurisdiction of the tribunals they had set at defiance.
They were speedily roused from their real or affected tranquillity
by trustworthy intelligence that processes for contempt
were already issued against them, and that their only chance
of escape from incarceration lay in precipitate flight. At ten
o'clock the astonished police saw a throng of panic-stricken
railway directors --- looking more like a frightened gang of
thieves, disturbed in the division of their plunder, than like
the wealthy representatives of a great corporation --- rush
headlong from the doors of the Erie office, and dash off in the
direction of the Jersey ferry. In their hands were packages
and files of papers, and their pockets were crammed with
assets and securities. One individual bore away with him in
a hackney-coach bales containing six millions of dollars in
greenbacks. Other members of the board followed under
cover of the night; some of them, not daring to expose themselves
to the publicity of a ferry, attempted to cross in open
boats concealed by the darkness and a March fog. Two directors,
who lingered, were arrested; but a majority of the Executive
Committee collected at the Erie Station in Jersey City,
and there, free from any apprehension of Judge Barnard's
pursuing wrath, proceeded to the transaction of business.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the river, Vanderbilt was
struggling in the toils. As usual in these Wall Street operations,
there was a grim humor in the situation. Had Vanderbilt
failed to sustain the market, a financial collapse and panic
must have ensued which would have sent him to the wall. He
had sustained it, and had absorbed a hundred thousand shares
of Erie. Thus when Drew retired to Jersey City he carried
with him seven millions of his opponent's money, and the
Commodore had freely supplied the enemy with the sinews of
war. He had grasped at Erie for his own sake, and now his
opponents derisively promised to rehabilitate and vivify the
old road with the money he had furnished them, so as more eff'ectually
to compete with the lines which he already possessed.
Nor was this all. Had they done as they loudly claimed
they meant to do, Vanderbilt might have hugged himself in
the faith that, after all, it was but a question of time, and the
prize would come to him in the end. He, however, knew well
enough that the most pressing need of the Erie people was
money with which to fight him. With this he had now furnished
them abundantly, and he must have felt that no scruples
would prevent their use of it.

Vanderbilt had, however, little leisure to devote to the enjoyment
of the humorous side of his position. The situation
was alarming. His opponents had carried with them in their
flight seven millions in currency, which were withdrawn from
circulation. An artificial stringency was thus created in Wall
Street, and, while money rose, stocks fell, and unusual margins
were called in. Vanderbilt was carrying a fearful load,
and the least want of confidence, the faintest sign of faltering,
might well bring on a crash. He already had a hundred
thousand shares of Erie, not one of which he could sell. He
was liable at any time to be called upon to carry as much
more as his opponents, skilled by long practice in the manufacture
of the article, might see fit to produce. Opposed to
him were men who scrupled at nothing, and who knew every
in and out of the money market. With every look and every
gesture anxiously scrutinized, a position more trying than his
can hardly be conceived. It is not known from what source
he drew the vast sums which enabled him to surmount his
difficulties with such apparent ease. His nerve, however,
stood him in at least as good stead as his financial resources.
Like a great general, in the hour of trial he inspired confidence.
While fighting for life he could "talk horse" and play
whist. The manner in which he then emerged from his troubles,
serene and confident, was as extraordinary as the financial
resources he commanded.

Meanwhile, before turning to the tide of battle, which now
swept away from the courts of law into the halls of legislation,
there are two matters to be disposed of; the division of
the spoils is to be recounted, and the old and useless lumber
of conflict must be cleared away. The division of profits
accruing to Mr. Treasurer Drew and his associate directors,
acting as individuals, was a fit conclusion to the stock issue
just described. The bonds for five millions, after their conversion,
realized nearly four millions of dollars, of which
$3,625,000 passed into the treasury of the company. The
trustees of the stockholders had therefore in this case secured
a profit for some one of $375,000. Confidence in the good
faith of one's kind is very commendable, but possession is
nine points of the law. Mr. James Fisk, Jr., through whom
the sales were mainly effected, declined to make any payments
in excess of the $3,625,000, until a division of profits was
agreed upon. It seems that, by virtue of a paper signed by
Mr. Drew as early as the 19th of February, Gould, Fisk, and
others were entitled to one half the profits he should make
"in certain transactions." What these transactions were, or
whether the official action of Directors Gould and Fisk was in
any way influenced by the signing of this document, does not
appear. Mr. Fisk now gave Mr. Drew, in lieu of cash, his
uncertified check for the surplus $375,000 remaining from
this transaction, with stock as collateral amounting to about
the half of that sum. With this settlement, and the redemption
of the collateral, Mr. Drew was fain to be content.
Seven months afterwards he still retained possession of the
uncertified check, in the payment of which, if presented, he
seemed to entertain no great confidence. Everything, however,
showed conclusively the advantage of operating from
interior lines. While the Erie treasury was once more replete,
three of the persons who had been mainly instrumental in
filling it had not suffered in the transaction. The treasurer
was richer by $180,000 directly, and he himself only knew
by how much more incidentally. In like manner his faithful
adjutants had profited to an amount as much exceeding
$60,000 each as their sagacity had led them to provide for.

The useless lumber of conflict, consisting chiefly of the numerous
judges of the Supreme Court of New York and their
conflicting processes of law, must next be disposed of. Judge
Gilbert was soon out of the field. His process had done its
work, and the Erie counsellors hardly deigned upon the 18th,
which was the day fixed for showing cause, to go over to
Brooklyn and listen to indignant denunciations on the part of
their Vanderbilt brethren, as, with a very halting explanation
of his hasty action, Judge Gilbert peremptorily denied the
request for further delay, and refused to continue his injunction.
It is due to this magistrate to say, that he is one of the
most respected in the State of New York; and when that is
said, much is implied in the facts already stated as to his
opinion of some of his brother judges. Judicial demoralization
can go no further. If Judge Gilbert was out of the fray,
however, Judge Barnard was not. The wrath and indignation
of this curious product of a system of elective judiciary cannot
be described, nor were they capable of utterance. They
took strange forms of expression. At one time he sent all the
papers relating to the alleged conspiracy down to the grand
jury, and apparently sought thereby to indicate that he courted
an investigation. The prosecuting attorneys, however, better
instructed in the law, seem to have doubted whether a matter
which was the proper subject for a legislative impeachment
could satisfactorily be brought before a petty jury on an indictment,
and did not pursue the investigation. Then, at a
later day, the judge mysteriously intimated that the belief
of both the counsel and the affiants in the truth of the
charges contained in the complaint before Judge Gilbert was
then a matter of investigation before a criminal body, to see
whether or not it constituted perjury. Finally, a heavy collection
of counter-affidavits purified the judicial skirts from
their taint, but not until fresh and more aggravated grounds
for indignation had presented themselves. It is unnecessary
to go into the details of the strange and revolting scenes which
the next few months witnessed in the rooms of the Supreme
Court. They read like some monstrous parody of the forms
of law; some Saturnalia of bench and bar. The magistrate
became more partisan than were the paid advocates before
him, and all seemed to vie with one another in their efforts to
bring their common profession into public contempt. Day
and night detectives in the pay of suitors dogged the steps of
the magistrate, and their sworn affidavits, filed in his own
court, sought to implicate him in an attempt to kidnap Drew
by means of armed ruffians, and to bring the fugitive by violence
within reach of his process. Then, in retaliation, the
judge openly avowed from the bench that his spies had penetrated
into the consultations of the litigants, and he astonished
a witness by angrily interrogating him as to an affidavit
reflecting upon himself, to which that witness had declined to
make oath.[^/34] At one moment he wept, as counsel detailed
before him the story of his own grievances and the insults to
which he had been subjected, and then again he vindicated
his purity by select specimens of pothouse rhetoric.[^/0351] When
the Vanderbilt counsel moved to fix a day on which their
opponents should show cause why a receiver of the proceeds
of the last over-issue of stock should not be appointed, the
judge astonished the petitioners by outstripping their eagerness,
and appointing Vanderbilt's own son-in-law receiver
on the spot. Then followed a fierce altercation in court, in
which bench and bar took equal part, and which closed with
the not unusual threat of impeaching the presiding judge.[^/0352]
When Mr. John B. Haskin was placed upon the stand, there
ensued a scene which Barnard himself not inaptly characterized
the next day as "outrageous and scandalous, and insulting
to the court." Upon this occasion the late Mr. James T.
Brady seemed to be on the verge of a personal collision with
the witness in open court; the purity of the presiding magistrate
was impugned, his venality openly implied through a
long cross-examination, and the witness acknowledged that he
had himself in the course of his career undertaken for money
to influence the mind of the judge privately "on the side
of right. All the scandals of the practice of the law, and
the private immoralities of lawyers, were dragged into the
broad light of day; the whole system of favored counsel,
of private argument, of referees, and of unblushing extortion,
was freely discussed.[^/36] On a subsequent day the judge himself
made inquiries as to a visit of two of the directors to one
gentleman supposed to have peculiar influence over the judicial
mind, and evinced great familiarity with the negotiations
then carried on, and even showed some disposition to extend
the inquiry indefinitely into periodical literature.[^/39] Nor were
the lawyers in any way behind the judge. At one moment
they would indulge in personal wrangling, and accuse each
other of the grossest malpractice, and the next, favor cach
other with remarks upon manners, more pointed than delicate.
All this time injunctions were flying about like hail-stones;
but the crowning injunction of all was issued, in reference to
the appointment of a receiver, by Judge Clerke, a colleague
of Judge Barnard, at the time sitting as a member of the
Court of Appeals at Albany. The Gilbert injunction had
gone, it might have seemed, sufficiently far, in enjoining
Barnard the individual, while distinctly disavowing all reference
to him in his judicial functions. Judge Clerke made no
such exception. He enjoined the individual and he enjoined
the judge; he forbade his making any order appointing a
receiver, and he forbade the clerks of his court from entering
it if it were made, and the receiver from accepting it if it
were entered. The signing of this extraordinary order by any
judge in his senses admits of no explanation. The Erie counsel
served it upon Judge Barnard as he sat upon the bench,
and, having done so, withdrew from the court-room; whereupon
the judge immediately proceeded to vacate the order,
and to appoint a receiver. This appointment was then entered
by a clerk, who had also been enjoined, and the receiver
was himself enjoined as soon as he could be caught. Finally
the maze had become so intricate, and the whole litigation so
evidently endless and aimless, that by a sort of agreement
of parties, Judge Ingraham, another colleague of Judge
Barnard, issued a final injunction of universal application,
as it were, and to be held inviolable by common consent,
under which proceedings were stayed, pending an appeal. It
was high time. Judges were becoming very shy of anything
connected with the name of Erie, and Judge McCunn had, in
a lofty tone, informed counsel that he preferred to subject
himself to the liability of a fine of a thousand dollars rather
than, by issuing a writ of _habeas corpus_, allow his court "to
have anything to do with the scandal."


[^/34]: Question by the Court to Mr. Belden. Did not Mr. Field send you, two or
three days ago, an affidavit filled with gross abuse of me, and you declined to
sign it?

Witness (producing a paper). This is the affidavit. I said I would rather
not sign it. ...

Question by Mr. Field. Did you show that affidavit to Judge Barnard?

A. I did not.

'Q. How, then, did he learn of its being sent to you?

Judge Barnard. He does not know, and never will in this world. I am
now doing as other people have been doing; I have been followed by detectives
for four or five weeks all over the city, and now I am following
others. ...

Q. Was it not stated openly to you, in a law office below Chambers
Street, that you must prevent, at all hazards, Judge Barnard from hearing
this case?

A. In hearing which case, Judge? I do not know which case you refer to.

Q. The case before me. ...

Q. When you were present at the Metropolitan Hotel, did not one of the
counsel, who was there, when he heard the complaint read, say that it was a
shame to put Judge Barnard in as a defendant, and did not Dudley Field say,
that by doing so he could frighten him off the bench and overawe the balance?

A. I do not remember anything of it.

Q. See if one of the counsel did not tell you that it was a shame to put
him in as one of the defendants, and whether another of the counsel did not
tell you that that was the only way to scare him off the bench, and that you
could overawe the balance of the judges?

A. I don't remember anything being said about overawing any one.


[^/0351]: "In this wide city of a million or a million and a half of inhabitants,
where a man can be hired for five dollars to swear any man's life away, there
is not one so base as to come upon this stand and swear that I had anything to
do with any conspiracy."


[^/0352]: The matter before the court, regarding the bail of the contumacious directors,
being disposed of, Mr. Clark, of the Vanderbilt counsel, rose and
referred to another matter, which proved to be no less than an application for
an order appointing a receiver of all the property, amounting to millions of
dollars, which had been issued in violation of the injunction.

Mr. Field. This is an _ex parte_ application and we do not care anything
about it. The worse you make the case the better it will be in the end.

Mr. Rapallo. I ask your honor to make this order returnable on Monday
morning.

The Court. I do not think it necessary to wait till Monday morning. You
had better have it returnable forthwith.

Mr. Clark. We ask that that paper (the order to show cause instantly) be
served upon Mr. Diven, who is now in court.

The order was then served on an individual director then in court, and Mr.
Clark moved the appointment of the receiver.

Judge Barnard. Is there any objection to this application?

Mr. Field sat smilingly in his chair, which was tipped back on its rear legs,
and looked composed in the extreme, but made no response to the inquiry of
the judge.

The Court. Draw up an order appointing George A. Osgood receiver of
this fund, with security in the sum of $1,000,000, and requiring these defendants
to appear before a referee in regard to the matter.

Mr. Field (rising). The court will understand that this was _ex parte_.

Mr. Clark. We have given notice, and therefore this is not _ex parte_.

Mr. Field. There has been no notice given; there has been no service.

This is _ex parte_, and now if any one will enter that order, I want to see him
do it.

Mr. Fullerton (excitedly and earnestly). I dare enter that order, and will
do it with your honor's permission.

Mr. Field. May it please the court, there have been no papers submitted
in this case, and no affidavits presented on which this order is made. You
have made it upon blank paper, and in complete absence of any regular proceeding
whatever. I wish to say, however, that just so sure as this proceeding
is being taken in this form, a day of reckoning will as surely come, when
these parties will have to answer before some one for this action.

Mr. Fullerton (in a decidedly animated tone). Let that day come, and
there will be a reckoning that you will have to bear, and so will every one of
those men who have been engaged in this transaction.


[^/36]: John B. Haskin was called as the next witness for the people, and examined
by Mr. Clark, and testified that he was an attorney at law, and had practised
about twenty-six years.

Question by Mr. Clark. Were you ever employed by Mr. Dudley Field,
professionally, prior to the 1st of March, or since?

A. I was applied to by Mr. Dudley Field, the attorney for Mr. Gould, on
the 5th or 6th of March last, to accept a retainer in this Erie Railroad controversy,
which I declined. I had never previous to that time been employed or
requested to act as counsel by Mr. Field.

Mr. Brady, "on his own responsibility," objected to this line of examination;
but after some discussion it was admitted, and the witness continued:---

Mr. Dudley Field, on the morning of the 5tlı or 6th of March, called at my
office, and desired to retain me as counsel in this Erie controversy. I asked
him on which side, and he said, " The Drew side." I asked him before whom,
and he said, before Judge Barnard. I replied that my intimacy had been very
great with Judge Barnard, and that I supposed he thought my influence as
associate in this case would assist his side of the litigation.

Q. What further was said?

A. He said that he desired me to accept a retainer in the case, and said
that if I would do so, it might be the means of avoiding serious trouble which
would take place in the legislature, as I was Judge Barnard's friend, and if I
would get that injunction modified I might, as his friend, prevent the terrible
consequences which would result in this fight which was to take place, as
Judge Barnard would be impeached; I then left him, and went into another
office. In a short time Dudley Field came back, and handed me this book
\[producing a book\], with his written modification of the injunction, as I believe,
in his own handwriting, saying, "If you will get that signed by Judge
Barnard, I will give you five thousand dollars; if that sum is not sufficient, I
will make it more." I declined the offer; and having occasion to go to the
City Hall to see Judge Barnard, I went, and met him at the Astor House,
where he had gone with some friends, --- John R. Hackett, Mr. Thomson, one
of the directors of the Erie Railroad Company, and some others whom I do
not recollect. I told him incidentally of this application to me, and he said:
"Dudley Field must be a dirty fellow to apply to you for this modification in
this way, for le applied to me in court this morning for this same modification,
and I refused to grant it."

Q. Did you see Dudley Field again?

A. I did not see him again.

Q. Did you accept the retainer?

A. I did not accept the retainer or undertake the service.

  ***

Cross-examination by Mr. James T. Brady.

Q. Well, Mr. Haskin, have you ever in your life been applied to by anybody,
to use your influence, personally or professionally, with Judge Barnard,
to accomplish any result whatever?

A. Yes, sir; I think I have.

Q. Personally?

A. Yes.

Q. Professionally?

A. Yes.

Q. To influence his action as a judge?

A. Well, no; not that.

Q. What, then?

A. Well, in cases where there were great interests at stake, to point out
to him certain objects that were entitled to consideration.

Q. Did you ever agree or undertake to influence his action as a judge.

A. I might have done so on the side of right. What do you mean,
sir?

Mr. Brady. O well, you will understand what I mean, sir. Have you
never in all your life used your influence with Judge Barnard to induce him
to make a decision in favor of some person in litigation whose cause you
espoused?

A. I don't recollect any case of that kind.

Q. Will you swear that you have never done so?

A. I won't swear I did n't, because I might have done it in some case in
the number of years I have been acquainted with him.

Q. Did you ever receive any kind of reward, directly or indirectly, for
using any species of influence, or promising to use any species of influence,
with Judge Barnard, or control or direct his action in any respect whatever?

A. I have never received anything; no, sir, except my legitimate fees,
which I have received in references and so forth.

  ***

He then asked him about his connection with the Christy will case.
Witness said he was general counsel in that.

Q. How did you earn your fee?

Witness. I will not answer; it is none of your business; it is impertinent.

Mr. Clark interposed, and said it was irrelevant.

Mr. Brady. I want to show that Mr. Haskin received a fee for his influence
with the judge to gain a decision at the General Term.

Mr. Haskin said there was a suit pending about the matter.

Mr. Brady repeated that when he went into the case he knew the hostility
with which he would be met. He was prepared for it. He had known some
of the men a great many years, and he had hitherto kept still. He would
repeat the question about the Christy will case.

Witness. I refuse to answer; it is none of your business.

Witness further on gave some testimony as to what he said to Judge Barnard
about the Merchants' Express Company case before that judge last summer;
he (witness) was not a counsel in it, but when on a fishing excursion
last suminer he was talking with the court about the law of the case. He
told the judge there were some cases in which a judge could not afford to do
a favor for a friend; I knew you were in the case, Mr. Brady; I told Judge
Barnard that the newspapers were all down on the express monopoly.

Mr. Brady. Did you, tell Judge Barnard in what cases a judge could
afford to do a favor for a friend! You say you told him there were some in
which a judge could not do a favor.

A. I did not say there were any.

  ***

The next day it was supposed that Mr. Field would be examined and the
court-room was crowded. Judge Barnard, however, declined to proceed any
further, and ordered the evidence of the previous day to be stricken from the
record. He further stated that he had already been busily engaged during the
day in the other court-room, and did not intend to sit here to gratify impertinent
curiosity. ... In regard to the examination of Mr. Field, he (Mr.
Field) could make his affidavit _ex parte_, and would have the same publicity
given to his testimony as had been given to that taken yesterday.

Mr. Brady said he appeared this afternoon exclusively to attend to the
examination of Mr. Field. Of course he had had no notice on his side of the
case that there had been any conference between his honor and other eminent
gentlemen as to what course should be taken. He had come to take charge
of Mr. Field's case, and as regards whatever had happened, he took the whole
responsibility of it. It belonged to him exclusively, --- every question, every
suggestion, --- as it would also belong to him hereafter. He simply asked now
that Mr. Field have the opportunity to be heard in the matter publicly, as the
other witnesses had been.

Mr. Clark, in reply, said that he would give Mr. Brady a promise that, if he
lived, he (Mr. Brady) should have the opportunity of examining Mr. Field before
a referee, if they could agree upon a gentleman who should be acceptable.

  ***

Judge Barnard, in reply to Mr. Field, who asked for the appointment of a
referee, said that he had made the only order in the case he would make today,
and that the matter would now stand adjourned until Thursday next, at
three o'clock, P. M.

No affidavit of Mr. Field was ever taken, and the subject was allowed to
drop.


[^/39]: Question by the Julge to Mr. Bellen. Do you know whether James Fisk,
Jr., and William H. Marston, went in a carriage to John J. Crane's house and
offered him $50,000 to vacate this injunction; and did you hear from a director
of the Erie Railroad that the Executive Committee had allowed that sum
to be paid?

Answer. No one of the directors told me this; but I think I heard something
of the kind. I can't tell from whom I heard it; there were numerous
reports flying about at the time.

  ***

Julge Barnard. I have n't \[addressing counsel\] ruled the question out
simply because I want to know whether I am fit to sit on the bench or not; if
I have been engaged in a conspiracy, I am unfit to sit here.

Mr. Field said the question would open new evidence that had already been
ruled out.

Judge Barnard. It was ruled out because I intend to have this "North
American Review" \[holding up the book\] put in evidence, which contains an
article about me, written by a clerk in your office. I intend to have this
whole matter ferreted out.

The result of this extraordinary litigation may be summed
up in a few words. It had two branches: one, the appointment
of a receiver of the proceeds of the hundred thousand
shares of stock issued in violation of an injunction; the
other, the processes against the persons of the directors for a
contempt of court. As for the receiver, every dollar of the
money this officer was intended to receive was well known
to be in New Jersey, beyond his reach. Why one party
cared to insist on the appointment, or why the other party
objected to it, is not very apparent. Mr. Osgood, the son-inlaw
of Vanderbilt, was appointed, and immediately enjoined
from acting; subsequently he resigned, when Mr. Peter B.
Sweeney, the head of the Tammany ring, was appointed in
his place, without notice to the other side. Of course he had
nothing to do, as there was nothing to be done, and so he was
subsequently allowed by Judge Barnard $ 150,000 for his services.
The contempt cases had even less result than that
of the receivership. The settlement subsequently effected
between the litigants seemed also to include the courts. The
outraged majesty of the law, as represented in the person
of Mr. Justice Barnard, was pacified, and everything was explained
as having been said and done in a "Pickwickian
sense"; so that, when the terms of peace had been arranged
between the high contending parties, Barnard's roaring by
degrees subsided, until he roared as gently as any sucking
dove, and finally he ceased to roar at all. The penalty for
violating an injunction in the manner described was fixed at
the not unreasonable sum of ten dollars, except in the cases
of Mr. Drew and certain of his more prominent associates;
their contumacy his Honor held too gross to be estimated in
money, and so they escaped without any punishment at all.
Probably being as well read a lawyer as he was a dignified
magistrate, Judge Barnard bore in mind, in imposing these
penalties, that clause of the fundamental law which provides
that "no excessive fines shall be imposed, or cruel or unusual
punishments inflicted." The legal profession alone had cause
to regret the cessation of this litigation; and, as the Erie
counsel had $150,000 divided among them in fees, it may
be presumed that even they were finally comforted. And
all this took place in the court of that State over which the
immortal Chancellor Kent had once presided. His great
authority was still cited there, the halo which surrounds his
name still shed a glory over the bench on which he had sat,
and yet these, his immediate successors, could

> On that high mountain cease to feed,
And batten on this moor.

## II

Ir is now necessary to return to the real field of operations,
which had ceased on the morning of the 11th of March to be
in the courts of law. As the arena widened the proceedings
became more complicated and more difficult to trace, embracing
as they did the legislatures of two States, neither
of them famed for purity. In the first shock of the catastrophe
it was actually believed that Commodore Vanderbilt contemplated
a resort to open violence and acts of private war.
There were intimations that a scheme had been matured for
kidnapping certain of the Erie directors, including Mr. Drew,
and bringing them by force within reach of Judge Barnard's
process. It appeared that on the 16th of March some fifty
individuals, subsequently described, in an affidavit filed for the
special benefit of Mr. Justice Barnard, as "disorderly characters,
commonly known as roughs," crossed by the Pavonia
Ferry and took possession of the Erie depot. From their
conversation and inquiries it was divined that they came
intending to "capp" Mr. Drew, or, in plainer phraseology, to
take him by force to New York; and that they expected to
receive the sum of $50,000 as a reward for so doing. The
exiles at once loudly charged Vanderbilt himself with originating
this blundering scheme. They simulated intense alarm.
From day to day new panics were started, until, on the 19th,
Drew was secreted, a standing army was organized from the
employees of the road, and a small navy equipped. The
alarm spread through Jersey City; the militia was held in
readiness; in the evening the stores were closed and the citizens
began to arm; while a garrison of about one hundred and
twenty-five men intrenched themselves around the directors,
in their hotel. On the 21st there was another alarm, and
the fears of an attack continued, with lengthening intervals
of quiet, until the 31st, when the guard was at last withdrawn.
It is impossible to suppose that Vanderbilt ever had
any knowledge of this ridiculous episode or of its cause, except
through the press. A band of ruffians may have crossed
the ferry, intending to kidnap Drew on speculation; but to
suppose that the shrewd and energetic Commodore ever sent
them to go gaping about a station, ignorant both of the person
and the whereabouts of him they sought would be to impute
to Vanderbilt at once a crime and a blunder. Such
botching bears no trace of his clean handiwork.

The first serious effort of the Erie party was to intrench
itself in New Jersey; and here it met with no opposition. A
bill making the Erie Railway Company a corporation of New
Jersey, with the same powers they enjoyed in New York, was
hurried through the legislature in the space of two hours,
and, after a little delay, signed by the Governor. The astonished
citizens of the latter State saw their famous broadgauge
road thus metamorphosed before their eyes into a denizen
of the kingdom of Camden and Amboy. Here was
another dreadful hint to Wall Street. What further issues
of stock might become legal under this charter, how the tenure
of the present Board of Directors might be altered, what
curious legal complications might arise, were questions more
easily put than satisfactorily answered. The region of possibilities
was considerably extended.The new act of incorporation,
however, was but a precaution to secure for the
directors of the Erie a retreat in case of need; the real field
of conflict lay in the legislature of New York, and here Vanderbilt
was first on the ground.

The corruption ingrained in the political system of New
York City is supposed to have been steadily creeping into the
legislature at Albany during several years past. The press
has rung with charges of venality against members of this
body; individuals have been pointed out as the recipients
of large sums; men have certainly become rich during short
terms in office; and, of all the rings which influence New
York legislation, the railroad ring is currently supposed to be
the most corrupt and corrupting. The mind of the unprejudiced
inquirer, who honestly desires to ascertain the truth on
this subject, will probably pass through several phases of belief
before settling into conviction. In the first place, he will
be overwhelmed by the broad, sweeping charges advanced in
the columns of the press by responsible editors and wellinformed
correspondents. He will read with astonishment
that legislation is controlled by cliques and is openly bought
and sold; that the lobby is but the legislative broker's board,
where votes are daily quoted; that sheep and bullocks are not
more regularly in the market at Smithfield than Assemblymen
and Senators at Albany. Amazed by such statements,
the inquirer becomes incredulous, and demands evidence in
support of them. This is never forthcoming. Committees
of investigation --- one or two in a session --- are regularly
appointed, and their reports are invariably calculated to confound
the existing confusion. These committees generally
express a belief in the existence of corruption and an utter
inability to find it out; against some notoriously venal brother
legislator they enter a Scotch verdict of "not proven"; and,
having thus far been very guarded in their language, they
then launch forth into tremendous denunciations of an unbridled
and irresponsible press. Here they have it all their
own way, and, indeed, too often make out an excellent case.
Meanwhile the seeker after truth leaves both correspondents
and committees, and tries to reach a conclusion by other
means. Public rumor he finds to be merely a reflection of the
press, or itself the impalpable form which the press reflects.
No conviction can be had on such evidence. He finds loose
statements, unproved assertions, and unsustained charges,
tending to produce general incredulity. Where so much more
is alleged than is proved, nothing is finally believed; until
individual corruption may be almost measured by an ostentatious
disregard of public opinion. Passing through the phase
of incredulity, the inquirer may at last resort to the private
judgment of the best informed. Appealing to individuals in
whose purity, judicial temper, and means of information he
has entire confidence, he will probably find his conclusions as
discouraging as they are inevitable. The weight of opinion
and of evidence gradually becomes irresistible, until his mind
settles down into a sad belief that probably no representative
bodies were ever more thoroughly venal, more shamelessly
corrupt, or more hopelessly beyond the reach of public opinion,
than are certain of those bodies which legislate for republican
America in this latter half of the nineteenth century.
Certainly, none of the developments which marked the Erie
conflict in the New York legislature of 1868 would tend to
throw doubts on this conclusion when once arrived at.

One favorite method of procedure at Albany is through the
appointment of committees to investigate the affairs of wealthy
corporations. The stock of some great company is manipulated
till it fluctuates violently, as was the case with Pacific
Mail in 1867. Forthwith some member of the Assembly rises
and calls for a committee of investigation. The instant the
game is afoot, a rush is made for positions on the committee.
The proposer, of course, is a member, probably chairman.
The advantages of the position are obvious. The committee
constitutes a little temporary outside ring. If a member
is corrupt, he has substantial advantages offered him to
influence his action in regard to the report. If he is not open
to bribery, he is nevertheless in possession of very valuable
information, and an innocent little remark, casually let fall,
may lead a son, a brother, or a loving cousin to make very
judicious purchases of stock. Altogether, the position is one
not to be avoided.

The investigation phase was the first which the Erie struggle
assumed at Albany. During the early stages of the conflict
the legislature had scented the carnage from afar. There was
money in it," and the struggle was watched with breathless
interest. As early as the 5th of March the subject had been
introduced into the State Senate, and an investigation into
the circumstances of the company was called for. A committee
of three was ordered, but the next day a senator, by name
Mattoon, moved to increase the number to five, which was
done, he himself being naturally one of the additional members.
This committee had its first sitting on the 10th, at the
very crisis of the great explosion. But before the investigation
was entered upon, Mr. Mattoon thought it expedient to
convince the contending parties of his own perfect impartiality
and firm determination to hold in check the corrupt impulses
of his associates. With this end in view, upon the 9th
or the 10th he hurried down to New York, and visited West
Street, where he had an interview with the leading Erie directors.
He explained to them the corrupt motives which had
led to the appointment of the committee, and how his sole
object in obtaining an increase of the number had been
to put himself in a position in which he might be able
to prevent these evil practices and see fair play. Curiously
enough, at the same interview he mentioned that his son was
to be appointed an assistant sergeant-at-arms to aid in the investigation,
and proved his disinterestedness by mentioning
the fact that this son was to serve without pay. The labors
of the committee continued until the 31st of March, and during
that time Mr. Mattoon, and at least one other senator,
pursued a course of private inquiry which involved further
visits to Jersey City. Naturally enough, Mr. Drew and his
associates took it into their heads that the man wanted to be
bought, and even affirmed subsequently that, at one interview,
he had in pretty broad terms offered himself for sale.
It has not been distinctly stated in evidence by any one that
an attempt was made on his purity or on that of his publicspirited
son; and it is difficult to believe that one who came
to New York so full of high purpose could have been sufficiently
corrupted by metropolitan influences to receive bribes
from both sides. Whether he did so or not his proceedings
were terribly suggestive as regards legislative morality at
Albany. Here was a senator, a member of a committee of investigation,
rousing gamblers from their beds at early hours
of the morning to hold interviews in the faro-bank parlor of
the establishment, and to give "points" on which to operate
upon the joint account. Even then the wretched creature
could not even keep faith with his very "pals"; he wrote to
them to " go it heavy " for Drew, and then himself went over to
Vanderbilt, --- he made agreements to share profits and then
submitted to exposure sooner than meet his part of the loss.
A man more thoroughly, shamefacedly contemptible and
corrupt, --- a more perfect specimen of a legislator on sale
haggling for his own price, could not well exist. In this case
he cheated every one, including himself. Accident threw
great opportunities in his way. On the 31st the draft of a
proposed report, exonerating in great measure the Drew faction,
was read to him by an associate, to which he not only
made no objection, but was even understood to assent. On
the same day another report was read in his presence, strongly
denouncing the Drew faction, sustaining to the fullest extent
the charges made against it, and characterizing its conduct as
corrupt and disgraceful. Each report was signed by two of his
associates, and Mr. Mattoon found himself in the position of
holding the balance of power; whichever report he signed
would be the report of the committee. He expressed a desire
to think the matter over. It is natural to suppose that, in his
eagerness to gain information privately, Mr. Mattoon had not
confined his unofficial visits to the Drew camp. In any case
his mind was in a state of painful suspense. Finally, after
arranging in consultation on Tuesday for a report favoring the
Drew party, on Wednesday he signed a report strongly denouncing
it, and by doing so settled the action of the committee.
Mr. Jay Gould must have been acquainted with the circumstances
of the case, and evidently supposed that Mr.
Mattoon was "fixed," since he subsequently declared he was
" astounded " when he heard that Mr. Mattoon had signed this
report. The committee, however, with their patriotic sergeant-at-arms,
whose services, by the way, cost the State but
a hundred dollars, desisted at length from their labors, the
result of which was one more point gained by Commodore
Vanderbilt.

Indeed, Vanderbilt had thus far as much outgeneralled
Drew in the manufacture of public opinion as Drew had outgeneralled
Vanderbilt in the manufacture of Erie stock. His
whole scheme was one of monopoly, which was opposed to
every interest of the city and State of New York, yet into the
support of this scheme he had brought all the leading papers
of New York City, with a single exception. Now again he
seemed to have it all his own way in the legislature, and the
tide ran strongly against the exiles of Erie. The report of the
investigation committee was signed on April 1st, and may be
considered as marking the high-water point of Vanderbilt's
success. Hitherto the Albany interests of the exiles had been
confided to mere agents, and had not prospered; but, when
fairly roused by a sense of danger, the Drew party showed at
least as close a familiarity with the tactics of Albany as with
those of Wall Street. The moment they felt themselves settled
at Jersey City they had gone to work to excite a popular
sympathy in their own behalf. The cry of monopoly was a
sure card in their hands. They cared no more for the actual
welfare of commerce, involved in railroad competition, than
they did for the real interests of the Erie Railway; but they
judged truly that there was no limit to the extent to which
the public might be imposed upon. An active competition
with the Vanderbilt roads, by land and water, was inaugurated;
fares and freights on the Erie were reduced on an average by
one third; sounding proclamations were issued; "interviewers"
from the press returned rejoicing from Taylor's Hotel to
New York City, and the Jersey shore quaked under the clatter
of this Chinese battle. The influence of these tactics
made itself felt at once. By the middle of March memorials
against monopoly began to flow in at Albany.

While popular sympathy was thus roused by the bribe of active
competition, a bill was introduced into the Assembly, in
the Erie interest, legalizing the recent issue of new stock,
declaring and regulating the power of issuing convertible
bonds, providing for a broad-gauge connection with Chicago
and the guaranty of the bonds of the Boston, Hartford, &
Erie, and finally forbidding, in so far as any legislation could
forbid, the consolidation of the Central and the Erie in the
hands of Vanderbilt. This bill was referred to the Committee
on Railroads on the 13th of March. On the 20th a public
hearing was begun, and the committee proceeded to take
evidence, aided by a long array of opposing counsel, most
of whom had figured in the proceedings in the courts of law.
In a few days the bill was adversely reported upon, and the
report adopted in the Assembly by the decisive vote of eightythree
to thirty-two. This was upon the 27th of March. The
hint was a broad one; the exiles must give closer attention to
their interests. So soon as the news of this adverse action
reached Jersey City, it was decided that Mr. Jay Gould should
brave the terrors of the law, and personally superintend matters
at Albany. Neither Mr. Drew nor his associates desired
to become permanent residents of Jersey City; nor did they
wish to return to New York as criminals on their way to jail.
Mr. Gould was to pave the way to a different return by causing
the recent issue of convertible bonds to be legalized. That
once done, Commodore Vanderbilt was not the man to wage
an unavailing war, and a compromise, in which Barnard and
his processes of contempt would be thrown in as a makeweight,
could easily be effected. A rumor was therefore
started that Mr. Gould was to leave for Ohio, supplied with
the necessary authority and funds to press vigorously to completion
the eighty miles of broad-gauge track between Akron
and Toledo, which would open to the Erie the much-coveted
connection with Chicago. Having hung out this false light,
Mr. Jay Gould went on his mission, the president of the company
having some time previously drawn half a million of dollars
out of the overflowing Erie treasury.

This mission was by no means unattended by difficulties.
In the first place, Judge Barnard's processes for contempt
seemed to threaten the liberty of Mr. Gould's person. He left
Jersey City and arrived at Albany on the 30th day of March,
three days after the defeat of the Erie bill, and two days
before Mr. Mattoon had made up his mind as to which report
he would sign. Naturally his opponents were well satisfied
with the present aspect of affairs, and saw no benefit likely to
arise from Mr. Gould's presence in Albany. The day after his
arrival, therefore, he was arrested, on the writ issued against
him for contempt of court, and held to bail in half a million
of dollars for his appearance in New York on the following
Saturday. He was immediately bailed of course, and for the
next few days devoted himself assiduously to the business he
had in hand. On Saturday he appeared before Judge Barnard,
and was duly put in charge of the sheriff to answer certain
interrogatories. It would seem to have been perfectly easy
for him to give the necessary bail, and to return from Barnard's
presence at once to Albany; but the simple method seems
never to have been resorted to throughout these complications :
nothing was ever done without the interposition of a writ and
the assistance of a crowd of counsel. In this case Judge
Barrett of the Common Pleas was appealed to, who issued a
writ of _habeas corpus_, by virtue of which Mr. Gould was taken
out of the hands of the sheriff and again brought into court.
Of course the hearing of the case was deferred, and it was
equally a matter of course that Mr. Gould was bent on returning
at once to his field of labor. The officer to whose care
Mr. Gould was intrusted was especially warned by the court,
in Mr. Gould's presence, that he was not to allow his charge
to go out of his sight. This difficulty was easily surmounted.
Mr. Gould went by an early train to Albany, taking the officer
with him in the capacity of a travelling companion. Once in
Albany he was naturally taken ill, --- not too ill to go to the
Capitol in the midst of a snow-storm, but much too ill to
think of returning to New York. On the 10th the trusty
official and travelling companion signified to Mr. Gould that
his presence was much desired before Judge Barrett, and intimated
an intention of carrying him back to New York. Mr.
Gould then pleaded the delicate condition of his health, and
wholly declined to undergo the hardships of the proposed journey.
Whereupon the officer, stimulated, as was alleged, by
Gould's opponents, returned alone to New York, and reported
his charge to the court as a runaway. A new spectacle of judicial
indignation ensued, and a new process for contempt
seemed imminent. Of course nothing came of it. A few
affidavits from Albany pacified the indignant Barrett. The
application for a _habeas corpus_ was discharged, and Mr. Gould
was theoretically returned into the custody of the sheriff.
Thereupon the required security for his appearance when
needed was given; and meanwhile, pending the recovery of his
health, he assiduously devoted the tedious hours of convalescence
to the task of cultivating a thorough understanding
between himself and the members of the legislature.

A strange legislative episode occurred at this time, which
for a day or two threatened to thwart Mr. Gould's operations,
but in the end materially facilitated them. All through
March the usual sensational charges had been flying through
the press in relation to the buying of votes on the pending
Erie measures. These were as vague and as difficult to sustain
as usual, and it was very important that no indiscreet
friend of legislative purity should blunder out charges which
could be triumphantly refuted. On the 1st of April, however,
the second day after Mr. Gould appeared on the ground, a
quiet country member named Glenn, remarkable for nothing
but his advanced years and white hair, suddenly created an
intense sensation by rising in his place in the Assembly and
excitedly declaring that he had just been offered money for
his vote on the Erie Bill. He then sent up to the Speaker
charges in writing, to the effect that the recent report on the
bill in question was bought, that members of the House were
engaged in purchasing votes, that reports of committees were
habitually sold, and ended by charging "corruption, deep,
dark, and damning on a portion of the House," of which he
felt "degraded in being a member." A committee of investigation
was, of course, appointed, and the press congratulated
the public that at last specific charges had been advanced
from a responsible quarter. On the 9th Mr. Glenn followed
up the attack by charging, again in writing, that one member
of the committee of investigation, whose name he gave, was
the very member who had offered him money for his vote.
Mr. Frear, the member in question, at once resigned his place
upon the committee, and demanded an investigation. Then it
turned out that the simple old gentleman, between his desire
for notoriety and his eagerness to expose corruption, had been
made the victim of a cruel joke. Some waggish colleagues
had pointed out to him an itinerant Jew, who haunted the
lobby and sold spectacles, as an agent of the fifth estate.
From him the old gentleman had, after some clumsy angling
and many leading questions, procured what he supposed to be
an offer of money for his vote, which, by a ludicrous misunderstanding,
managed by his humorous colleagues, was made
to appear in his eyes as having received Mr. Frear's indorsement.
Mr. Glenn's charges ended, therefore, in a ridiculous
fiasco, and in a tremendous outburst of offended legislative
virtue. The committee reported on the 10th; every one was
exonerated; Mr. Glenn was brought to the bar and censured,
and the next day he resigned. As for the astonished pedler,
he was banished from the lobby, imprisoned, prosecuted, and
forgotten. The display of indignation on the part of Mr.
Glenn's brother legislators was, in view of the manifest absurdity
of the whole affair, somewhat superfluous and somewhat
suspicious; but one such false accusation protects a multitude
of real sins. The trade of censor of morals fell into disrepute
at Albany; and, under the shadow of this parody upon
exposures of corruption, Mr. Gould was at liberty to devote
himself to serious business without fear of interruption.

The full and true history of this legislative campaign will
never be known. If the official reports of investigating committees
are to be believed, Mr. Gould at about this time
underwent a curious psychological metamorphosis, and suddenly
became the veriest simpleton in money matters that
ever fell into the hands of happy sharpers. Cunning lobby
members had but to pretend to an influence over legislative
minds, which every one knew they did not possess, to draw
unlimited amounts from this verdant _habitué_ of Wall Street.
It seemed strange that he could have lived so long and learned
so little. He dealt in large sums. He gave to one man, in
whom he said "he did not take much stock," the sum of
$5,000, "just to smooth him over." This man had just before
received $5,000 of Erie money from another agent of
the company. It would, therefore, be interesting to know
what sums Mr. Gould paid to those individuals in whom he
did "take much stock." Another individual is reported to
have received $ 100,000 from one side, "to influence legislation,"
and to have subsequently received $70,000 from the
other side to disappear with the money; which he accordingly
did, and thereafter became a gentleman of elegant leisure.
One senator was openly charged in the columns of the press
with receiving a bribe of $20,000 from one side, and a second
bribe of $15,000 from the other; but Mr. Gould's foggy
mental condition only enabled him to be "perfectly astounded"
at the action of this senator, though he knew nothing of any
such transactions. Other senators were blessed with a sudden
accession of wealth, but in no case was there any jot or tittle
of proof of bribery. Mr. Gould's rooms at the Develin House
overflowed with a joyous company, and his checks were numerous
and heavy; but why he signed them, or what became
of them, he seemed to know less than any man in Albany.
This strange and expensive hallucination lasted until about
the middle of April, when Mr. Gould was happily restored to
his normal condition of a shrewd, acute, energetic man of
business; nor is it known that he has since experienced any
relapse into financial idiotcy.

About the period of Mr. Gould's arrival in Albany the tide
turned, and soon began to flow strongly in favor of Erie and
against Vanderbilt. How much of this was due to the
skilful manipulations of Gould, and how much to the rising
popular feeling against the practical consolidation of competing
lines, cannot be decided. The popular protests did indeed
pour in by scores, but then again the Erie secret-service money
poured out like water. Yet Mr. Gould's task was sufficiently
difficult. After the adverse report of the Senate committee,
and the decisive defeat of the bill introduced into the Assembly,
any favorable legislation seemed almost hopeless. Both
Houses were committed. Vanderbilt had but to prevent action,---
to keep things where they were, and the return of his
opponents to New York was impracticable, unless with his
consent; he appeared, in fact, to be absolute master of the
situation. It seemed almost impossible to introduce a bill in
the face of his great influence, and to navigate it through the
many stages of legislative action and executive approval,
without somewhere giving him an opportunity to defeat it.
This was the task Gould had before him, and he accomplished
it. On the 13th of April a bill, which met the approval of
the Erie party, and which Judge Barnard subsequently compared
not inaptly to a bill legalizing counterfeit money, was
taken up in the Senate; for some days it was warmly debated,
and on the 18th was passed by the decisive vote of seventeen
to twelve. Senator Mattoon had not listened to the debate
in vain. Perhaps his reason was convinced, or perhaps he
had sold out new "points" and was again cheating himself or
somebody else; at any rate, that thrifty senator was found
voting with the majority. The bill practically legalized the
recent issues of bonds, but made it a felony to use the proceeds
of the sale of these bonds except for completing, furthering,
and operating the road. The guaranty of the bonds
of connecting roads was authorized, all contracts for consolidation
or division of receipts between the Erie and the Vanderbilt
roads were forbidden, and a clumsy provision was
enacted that no stockholder, director, or officer in one of the
Vanderbilt roads should be an officer or director in the Erie,
and vice versa. The bill was, in fact, an amended copy of the
one voted down so decisively in the Assembly a few days
before, and it was in this body that the tug of war was expected
to come.

The lobby was now full of animation; fabulous stories
were told of the amounts which the contending parties were
willing to expend; never before had the market quotations of
votes and influence stood so high. The wealth of Vanderbilt
seemed pitted against the Erie treasury, and the vultures
flocked to Albany from every part of the State. Suddenly,
at the very last moment, and even while special trains were
bringing up fresh contestants to take part in the fray, a rumor
ran through Albany as of some great publie disaster, spreading
panie and terror through hotel and corridor. The obings
came of some great defeat, as that on the Chickahominy
or at Fredericksburg. In a moment the lobby was smitten.
with despair, and the cheeks of the legislators were blanched,
for it was reported that Vanderbilt had withdrawn his opposition
to the bill. The report was true. Either the Commodore
had counted the cost and judged it excessive, or he despaired
of the result. At any rate, he had yielded in advance.
In a few moments the long struggle was over, and that bill
which, in an unamended form, had but a few days before been
thrown out of the Assembly by a vote of eighty-three to
thirty-two, now passed it by a vote of one hundred and one to
six, and was sent to the Governor for his signature. Then the
wrath of the disappointed members turned on Vanderbilt.
Decency was forgotten in a frenzied sense of disappointed
avarice. That same night the _pro rata_ freight bill, and a bill
compelling the sale of through tickets by competing lines,
were hurriedly passed, simply because they were thought
hurtful to Vanderbilt; and the docket was ransacked in
search of other measures, calculated to injure or annoy him.
An adjournment, however, brought reflection, and subsequently,
on this subject, the legislature stultified itself no
more.

The bill had passed the legislature; would it receive the
Executive signature? Here was the last stage of danger.
For some time doubts were entertained on this point, and the
last real conflict between the opposing interests took place in
the Executive Chamber at Albany. There, on the afternoon
of the 21st of April, Commodore Vanderbilt's counsel appeared
before Governor Fenton, and urged upon him their
reasons why the bill should be returned by him to the Senate
without his signature. The arguments were patiently listened
to, but, when they had closed, the Executive signature placed
the seal of success upon Mr. Gould's labors at Albany. Even
here the voice of calumny was not silent. As if this remarkable
controversy was destined to leave a dark blot of suspicion
upon every department of the civil service of New York,
there were not wanting those who charged the Executive
itself with the crowning act in this history of corruption. The
very sum pretended to have been paid was named; the broker
of Executive action was pointed out, and the number of minutes
was specified which should intervene between the payment
of the bribe and the signing of the law.[^/56]

Practically, the conflict was now over, and the period of
negotiation had already begun. The combat in the courts
was indeed kept up until far into May, for the angry passions
of the lawyers and of the judges required time in which to
wear themselves out. Day after day the columns of the press
revealed fresh scandals to the astonished public, which at last
grew indifferent to such revelations. Beneath all the wrangling
of the courts, however, while the popular attention was distracted
by the clatter of lawyers' tongues, the leaders in the
controversy were quietly approaching a settlement. In the
early days of his exile Mr. Drew had been more depressed in
spirit, more vacillating in counsel, than his younger and more
robust associates. The publicity and excitement which had
sustained and even amused them had wearied and annoyed
the old man. His mind had been oppressed with saucy doubts
and tormented by officious advisers. Stronger wills than his
were bearing him along with them; and though, perhaps, not
more scrupulous than those about him, he was certainly less
bold; their reckless daring shocked his more subtle and timid
nature. He missed also his home comforts; he felt himself a
prisoner in everything but in name; he knew that he was
distrusted, and his every action watched by associates of whom
he even stood in physical fear, who hardly allowed him to see
his brokers alone, and did not respect the sanctity of his telegrams.
After the first week or two, and as affairs began to
assume a less untoward aspect, his spirits revived, and he soon
began to make secret advances towards his angry opponent.
The hostilities of the Stock Exchange are proverbially shortlived.
A broker skilled in the ways of his kind gave it as his
opinion, in one of these proceedings, that five minutes was
the utmost period during which it was safe to count on the
enmities or alliances of leading operators. Early in April
Mr. Drew took advantage of that blessed immunity from
arrest which the Sabbath confers on the hunted of the law, to
revisit the familiar scenes across the river. His visit soon
resulted in conferences between himself and Vanderbilt, and
these conferences naturally led to overtures of peace. Though
the tide was turning against the great railroad king, though
an uncontrollable popular feeling was fast bearing down his
schemes of monopoly, yet he was by no means beaten or subdued.
His plans, however, had evidently failed for the present;
as he expressed himself, he could easily enough buy up
the Erie Railway, but he could not buy up the printing-press.
It was now clearly his interest to abandon his late line of attack,
and to bide his time patiently, or to possess himself of his
prey by some other method. The wishes of all parties, therefore,
were fixed on a settlement, and no one was disposed to
stand out except in order to obtain better terms. The interests,
however, were multifarious. There were four parties to
be taken care of, and the depleted treasury of the Erie Railway
was doomed to suffer.


[^/56]: It is but justice to Governor Fenton to say, that, though this charge was
boldly advanced by respectable journals of his own party, it cannot be considered
as sustained by the evidence. The testimony on the point will be
found in the report of Senator Hale's investigating committee. Documents
(Senate), 1869, No. 52, pp. 146--148, 151--155.

The details of this masterpiece of Wall Street diplomacy
have never come to light, but Mr. Drew's visits to New York
became more frequent and less guarded; by the middle
of April he had appeared in Broad Street on a week-day, undisturbed
by fears of arrest, and soon rumors began to spread
of misunderstandings between himself and his brother exiles.
It was said that his continual absences alarmed them, that
they distrusted him, that his terms of settlement were not
theirs. It was even asserted that his orders on the treasury
were no longer honored, and that he had, in fact, ceased to be
a power in Erie. Whatever truth there may have been in
these rumors, it was very evident his associates had no inclination
to trust themselves within the reach of the New York
courts until a definitive treaty, satisfactory to themselves, was
signed and sealed. This probably took place about the 25th
of April; for on that day the Erie camp at "Fort Taylor," as
their uninviting hotel had been dubbed, was broken up, the
President and one of the Executive Committee took steamer
for Boston, and the other directors appeared before Judge
Barnard, prepared to purge themselves of their contempt.

Though the details of negotiation have never been divulged,
yet it was clear enough what three of the four parties desired.
Commodore Vanderbilt wished to be relieved of the vast
amount of stock with which he was loaded, and his friends
Work and Schell, in whose names the battle had been fought,
must be protected. Mr. Drew desired to settle his entangled
accounts as treasurer, and to obtain a release in full, which
might be pleaded in future complications. Mr. Eldridge and
his Boston friends were sufficiently anxious to be relieved
of the elephant they found on their hands, in the Erie Railway
of New York, and to be at leisure to devote the spoils
of their victim to the development of their New England enterprise.
Messrs. Gould and Fisk alone were unprovided for,
and they alone presented themselves as obstacles to be overcome
by railroad diplomacy.

At last, upon the 2d of July, Mr. Eldridge formally announced
to the Board of Directors that the terms of peace
had been agreed upon. Commodore Vanderbilt was, in the
first place, provided for. He was to be relieved of fifty thousand
shares of Erie stock at 70, receiving therefor $2,500,000
in cash, and $1,250,000 in bonds of the Boston, Hartford, &
Erie at 80. He was also to receive a further sum of $1,000,000
outright, as a consideration for the privilege the Erie road
thus purchased of calling upon him for his remaining fifty
thousand shares at 70 at any time within four months. He
was also to have two seats in the Board of Directors, and all
suits were to be dismissed and offences condoned. The sum
of $429,250 was fixed upon as a proper amount to assuage
the sense of wrong from which his two friends Work and
Schell had suffered, and to efface from their memories all
recollection of the unfortuate "pool" of the previous December.
Why the owners of the Erie Railway should have paid
this indemnity of $4,000,000 is not very clear. The operations
were apparently outside of the business of a railway
company, and no more connected with the stockholders of the
Erie than were the butchers' bills of the individual directors.

While Vanderbilt and his friends were thus provided for,
Mr. Drew was to be left in undisturbed enjoyment of the fruits
of his recent operations, but was to pay into the treasury
$540,000 and interest, in full discharge of all claims and
causes of action which the Erie Company might have against
him. The Boston party, as represented by Mr. Eldridge, was
to be relieved of $5,000,000 of their Boston, Hartford, &
Erie bonds, for which they were to receive $4,000,000 of Erie
acceptances. None of these parties, therefore, had anything
to complain of, whatever might be the sensations of the real
owners of the railway. A total amount of some $ 9,000,000 in
cash was drawn from the treasury in fulfilment of this _settlement_,
as the persons concerned were pleased to term this
remarkable disposition of property intrusted to their care.

Messrs. Gould and Fisk still remained to be taken care
of, and to them their associates left --- the Erie Railway. These
gentlemen subsequently maintained that they had vehemently
opposed this settlement, and had denounced it in the secret
councils as a fraud and a robbery. Mr. Fisk was peculiarly
outspoken in relation to it, and declared himself "thunderstruck
and dumbfounded" that his brother directors whom he
had supposed respectable men should have had anything to
do with any such proceeding. A small portion of this state
ment is not wholly improbable. The astonishment at the
turpitude of his fellow-officials was a little unnecessary in one
who had already seen "more robbery" during the year of his
connection with the Erie Railway than he had "ever seen before
in the same space of time," --- so much of it indeed that he
dated his "gray hairs" from that 7th of October which saw
his election to the board. That Mr. Fisk and Mr. Gould were
extremely indignant at a partition of plunder from which they
were excluded is, however, very certain. The rind of the
orange is not generally considered the richest part of the fruit;
a corporation on the verge of bankruptcy is less coveted, even
by operators in Wall Street, than one rich in valuable assets.
Probably at this time these gentlemen seriously debated the
expediency of resorting again to a war of injunctions, and
carefully kept open a way for doing so; however this may
have been, they seem finally to have concluded that there was
yet plunder left in the poor old hulk, and so, after four stormy
interviews, all opposition was at last withdrawn and the definitive
treaty was finally signed.[^/60] Mr. Eldridge thereupon
counted out his bonds and received his acceptances, which
latter were cashed at once to close up the transaction, and at
once he resigned his positions as director and president. The
Boston raiders then retired, heavy with spoil, into their own
North country, and there proceeded to build up an Erie influence
for New England, in which task they labored with assiduity
and success. Gradually they here introduced the more
highly developed civilization of the land of their temporary
adoption and boldly attempted to make good their private
losses from the public treasury. A more barefaced scheme
of plunder never was devised, and yet the executive veto
alone stood between it and success. These, however, were the
events of another year and unconnected with this narrative,
from which these characters in the Erie management henceforth
disappear. For the rest it is only necessary to say that
Mr. Vanderbilt, relieved of his heavy load of its stock, apparently
ceased to concern himself with Erie; while Daniel
Drew, released from the anxieties of office, assumed for a
space the novel character of a looker-on in Wall Street.


[^/60]: The account given of this affair by Mr. Fisk from the witness stand on a
subsequent occasion was characteristic: "Finally about twelve o'clock a
paper was passed round and we signed it; I don't know what it contained; I
did n't read it; I don't think I noticed a word of it; I remember the space for
the names was greater than that covered by the writing; my impression is
that I took my hat and left at once in disgust; I told Gould we had sold ourselves
to the Devil; I presume that was not the only document signed; I remember
seeing Mr. White, the cashier, come in with the check-book, and I
said to him, 'You are bearing in the remains of this corporation to be put in
Vanderbilt's tomb.' No; I didn't know the contents of the paper which I
signed, and I have always been glad that I didn't; I have thought of it a thousand
times: I don't know what other documents I signed; I signed everything
that was put before me; after once the Devil had hold of me I kept on signing;
did n't read any of them and have no idea what they were; I don't know how
many I signed; I kept no count after the first one: I went with the robbers
then and I have been with them ever since; my impression is that after the
signing I left at once; I don't know whether we sat down or not; we didn't
have anything to eat, I know."

## III

THUS, in the early days of July, Messrs. Fisk and Gould
found themselves beginning life, as it were, in absolute control
of the Erie Railway, but with an empty treasury and a doubtful
reputation. Outwardly things did not look unpromising.
The legal complications were settled, and the fearful load
imposed by the settlement upon the already overburdened
resources of the road was not, of course, imparted to the public.
It is unnecessary to add that the "outside" holders
of the stock were, in the counsels of the managers, included
in that public the inquiries of which in regard to the affairs
of the company were looked upon by the ring in control as
downright impertinence. A calm --- deceitful indeed, but yet
a calm --- succeeded the severe agitations of the money market.
All through the month of July money was easy and
ruled at three or four %; Erie was consequently high,
and was quoted at about seventy, which enabled the company
to dispose without loss of the Vanderbilt stock. It may well
be believed that Messrs. Fisk and Gould could not have regarded
their empty treasury, just depleted to the extent of
nine millions,--- trust funds misapplied by directors in the processes
of stock-gambling, --- without serious question as to their
ability to save the road from bankruptcy. The October election
was approaching, Vanderbilt was still a threatening element
in the future, and new combinations might arise.
Millions were necessary, and must at once be forthcoming.
The new officials were, however, men of resource, and were
not men of many scruples. The money must be raised, and
recent experience indicated a method of raising it. Their
policy, freed from the influence of Drew's vacillating, treacherous,
and withal timid nature, could now be bold and direct.
The pretence of resistance to monopoly would always serve
them, as it had served them before, as a plausible and popular
cry. Above all, their councils were now free from interlopers
and spies; for the first act of Messrs. Gould and Fisk had been
to do away with the old board of auditors, and to concentrate
all power in their own hands as president, treasurer, and controller.
Fortunately for them it was midsummer, and the
receipts of the road were very heavy, supplying them with
large sums of ready money;[^/62] most fortunately for them, also,
a strange infatuation at this time took possession of the English
mind.


[^/62]: It will be remembered that the act of 21st April, legalizing the issue of
bonds, made it a felony to devote the proceeds to any purpose except equipping,
constructing, and operating the road. Mr. Gould's explanation of the
effect he gave to this clause is not only amusing as a piece of impudence, but
extremely suggestive as regards the efficacy of legislation. Mr. Gould, be it
remembered, procured the passage of the law, and Mr. Gould thus explains to
the railroad committee of the legislature the force he gave to its provisions.

Mr. Gould. ... The law is, that you can only use the money realized on
these bonds for the purpose of equipping, constructing, and operating the road,
and therefore I had to use the earnings of the road to meet these large liabilities,
which had been authorized by the board (the Eldridge-Vanderbilt settlement),
and use the money realized from the bonds to equip, construct, and
operate the road. ...

Question by Mr. Waterman. In fact these twenty million of bonds were
issued to meet these obligations, and not for the purpose of maintaining, operating,
and constructing the road?

Answer. No, sir; I used the earnings of the road to meet these obligations.
... We had to live up to the letter of the law, and use the money realized
from the bonds for the purpose of operating, constructing, and equipping the
road.

Q. But your pressing need of money was not for the purpose of operating
the road, but for the purpose of meeting these obligations?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. The amount of money you sought to raise was the amount of these
obligations?

A. Yes, sir.

Shrewd as the British capitalist proverbially is, his judgment
in regard to American investments has been singularly
fallible. When our national bonds went begging at a discount
of sixty %, he transmitted them to Germany and refused
to touch them himself. At the very same time a class of railroad
securities --- such as those of this very Erie Railway, or,
to cite a yet stronger case, those of the Atlantic & Great Western
road --- was gradually absorbed in London as an honest investment
long after these securities had "gone into the street"
in America. It was this strange fatuity which did much. to
bring on the crash of May, 1866. Even that did not seem to
teach wisdom to the British bankers, who had apparently
passed from the extreme of caution to the extreme of confidence.
They now, after all the exposures of the preceding
months, rushed into Erie, apparently because it seemed cheap,
and the prices in New York were sustained by the steady demand
for stock on foreign account. Not only did this curious
infatuation, involving purchases to the extent of a hundred
thousand shares, cover up the operations of the new ring, but,
at a later period, the date of the possible return of this stock
to Wall Street was the hinge on which the success of its culminating
plot was made to turn.

The appearance of calm lasted but about thirty days.
Early in August it was evident that something was going on.
Erie suddenly fell ten %; in a few days more it experienced
a further fall of seven %, touching 44 by the 19th
of the month, upon which day, to the astonishment of Wall
Street, the transfer-books of the company were closed preparatory
to the annual election. As this election was not to
take place until the 13th of October, and as the books had
thus been closed thirty days in advance of the usual time, it
looked very much as though the managers were satisfied with
the present disposition of the stock, and meant, by keeping it
where it was, to preclude any such unpleasantness as an
opposition ticket. The courts and a renewed war of injunctions
were of course open to any contestants, including Commodore
Vanderbilt, who might desire to avail themselves of
them; probably, however, the memory of recent struggles
was too fresh to permit any one to embark on those treacherous
waters. At any rate, nothing of the sort was attempted.
The election took place at the usual time, and the ring in
control voted itself, without opposition, into a new lease of
power. Two new names had meanwhile appeared in the list
of Erie directors, --- those of Peter B. Sweeney and William M.
Tweed, the two most prominent leaders of that notorious
ring which controls the proletariat of New York City and
governs the politics of the State. The alliance was an ominous
one, for the construction of the new board can be stated
in few words, and calls for no comment. It consisted of the
Erie ring and the Tammany ring, brought together in close
political and financial union; and, for the rest, a working
majority of supple tools and a hopeless minority of respectable
figure-heads. This formidable combination shot out its
feelers far and wide: it wielded the influence of a great corporation
with a capital of a hundred millions; it controlled
the politics of the first city of the New World; it sent its
representatives to the Senate of the State, and numbered
among its agents the judges of the courts. Compact, diseiplined,
and reckless, it knew its own power and would not
scruple to use it.

It was now the month of October, and the harvest had been
gathered. The ring and its allies determined to reap their
harvest also, and that harvest was to be nothing less than a
contribution levied, not only upon Wall Street and New York,
but upon all the immense interests, commercial and financial,
which radiate from New York all over the country. Like the
Cæsar of old, they issued their edict that all the world should
be taxed. The process was not novel, but it was effective. A
monetary stringency may be looked for in New York at certain
seasons of every year. It is generally most severe in the
autumn months, when the crops have to be moved, and the
currency is drained steadily away from the financial centre
towards the extremities of the system. The method by which
an artificial stringency is produced is thus explained in a
recent report of the Comptroller of the Currency: "It is
scarcely possible to avoid the inference that nearly one half
of the available resources of the national banks in the city of
New York are used in the operations of the stock and gold exchange;
that they are loaned upon the security of stocks
which are bought and sold largely on speculation, and which
are manipulated by cliques and combinations, according as
the bulls or bears are for the moment in the ascendency. ...
Taking advantage of an active demand for money to move the
crops West and South, shrewd operators form their combination
to depress the market by 'locking up' money, --- withdrawing
all they can control or borrow from the common
fund; money becomes searce, the rate of interest advances,
and stocks decline. The legitimate demand for money continues;
and, fearful of trenching on their reserve, the banks
are strained for means. They dare not call in their demand
loans, for that would compel their customers to sell securities
on a falling market, which would make matters worse. Habitually
lending their means to the utmost limit of prudence,
and their credit much beyond that limit, to brokers and speculators,
they are powerless to afford relief; --- their customers
by the force of circumstances become their masters. The
banks cannot hold back or withdraw from the dilemma in
which their mode of doing business has placed them. They
must carry the load to save their margins. A panie which
should greatly reduce the price of securities would occasion
serious, if not fatal, results to the banks most extensively
engaged in such operations, and would produce a feeling of
insecurity which would be very dangerous to the entire banking
interest of the country."[^/65]

All this machinery was now put in motion; the banks and
their customers were forced into the false position described,
and towards the end of October it had become perfectly notorious
in Wall Street that large new issues of Erie had been
made, and that these new issues were intimately connected
with the sharp stringency then existing in the money market.
It was at last determined to investigate the matter, and upon
the 27th of the month a committee of three was appointed
by the Stock Exchange to wait upon the officers of the corporation
with the view of procuring such information as they
might be willing to impart. The committee called on Mr.
Gould and stated the object of their visit. In reply to their
inquiries Mr. Gould informed them that Erie convertible bonds
for ten millions of dollars had been issued, half of which had
already been, and the rest of which would be, converted into
stock; that the money had been devoted to the purchase of
Boston, Hartford, & Erie bonds for five millions, and also ---
of course --- to payments for steel rails. The committee desired
to know if any further issue of stock was in contemplation,
but were obliged to rest satisfied with a calm assurance
that no new issue was just then contemplated except "in certain
contingencies"; from which enigmatical utterances Wall
Street was left to infer that the exigencies of Messrs. Gould
and Fisk were elements not to be omitted from any calculations
as to the future of Erie and the money market. The
amount of these issues of new stock was, of course, soon
whispered in a general way; but it was not till months afterwards
that a sworn statement of the secretary of the Erie
Railway revealed the fact that the stock of the corporation
had been increased from $34,265,300 on the 1st of July,
1868, the date when Drew and his associates had left it, to
$57,766,300 on the 24th of October of the same year, or by
two hundred and thirty-five thousand shares in four months.[^/66]
This, too, had been done without consultation with the board
of directors, and with no other authority than that conferred
by the ambiguous resolution of February 19. Under that
resolution the stock of the company had now been increased
one hundred and thirty-eight % in eight months. Such
a process of inflation may, perhaps, be justly considered the
most extraordinary feat of financial legerdemain which history
has yet recorded.


[^/65]: Finance Report, 1868, pp. 20, 21.


[^/66]: In April, 1871, although the stock was then nominally registered, a further
secret issue was made by which some $ 600,000 in cash was realized on
$3,000,000 of stock. Periodical issues had then carried the gross amount up to
the neighborhood of $86,500,000; or from a total of 250,000 shares, when the
management changed at the election of October 17, 1867, to 865,000 shares
within four years. Apparently Mr. Fisk was more correct than usual in his
statement, when he remarked, that, having once joined the robbers, "he had
been with them ever since."

Now, however, when the committee of the Stock Exchange
had returned to those who sent them, the mask was thrown
off, and operations were conducted with vigor and determination.
New issues of Erie were continually forced upon the
market until the stock fell to 35; greenbacks were locked up
in the vaults of the banks, until the unexampled sum of
twelve millions was withdrawn from circulation; the prices
of securities and merchandise declined; trade and the autumnal
movement of the crops were brought almost to a
stand-still; and loans became more and more difficult to negotiate,
until at length even one and a half % a day was
paid for carrying stocks. Behind all this it was notorious that
some one was pulling the wires, the slightest touch upon
which sent a quiver through every nerve of the great financial
organism, and wrung private gain from public agony. The
strange proceeding reminds one of those scenes in the chambers
of the Inquisition where the judges calmly put their
victim to the question, until his spasms warned them not to
exceed the limits of human endurance. At last the public
distress reached the ears of the government at Washington.
While it was simply the gamblers of Wall Street who were
tearing each other, their clamor for relief excited little sympathy.
When, however, the suffering had extended through
all the legitimate business circles of the country, --- when the
scarcity of money threatened to cut off the winter food of the
poor, to rob the farmer of the fruits of his toil, and to bring
ruin upon half the debtor class of the community, --- then
even Mr. McCulloch, pledged as he was to contraction, was
moved to interfere. The very revenues of the government
were affected by the operations of gamblers. They were
therefore informed that, if necessary, fifty millions of additional
currency would be forthcoming to the relief of the
community, and then, and not till then, the screws were

The harvest of the speculators, however, was still but half
gathered. Hitherto the combination had operated for a fall.
Now was the moment to change the tactics and take advantage
of the rise. The time was calculated to a nicety. The
London infatuation had wonderfully continued, and as fast as
certificates of stock were issued they seemed to take wings
across the Atlantic. Yet there was a limit even to English
credulity, and in November it became evident that the agents
of foreign houses were selling their stock to arrive. The
price was about 40; the certificates might be expected by the
steamer of the 23d. Instantly the combination changed
front. As before they had depressed the market, they now
ran it up, and, almost as if by magic, the stock, which had
been heavy at 40, astonished every one by shooting up to 50.
New developments were evidently at hand.

At this point Mr. Daniel Drew once more made his appearance
on the stage. As was very natural, he had soon wearied
of the sameness of his part as a mere looker-on in Wall Street,
and had relapsed into his old habits. He was no longer
treasurer of the Erie, and could not therefore invite the public
to the game, while he himself with sombre piety shook the
loaded dice. But it had become with him a second nature to
operate in Erie, and once more he was deep in its movements.
At first he had combined with his old friends, the present
directors, in their "locking-up" conspiracy. He had agreed
to assist them to the extent of four millions. The vacillating,
timid nature of the man, however, could not keep pace with
his more daring and determined associates, and, after embarking
a million, becoming alarmed at the success of the joint
operations and the remonstrances of those who were threatened
with ruin, he withdrew his funds from the operators'
control and himself from their councils. But though he did
not care to run the risk or to incur the odium, he had no sort
of objection to sharing the spoils. Knowing, therefore, or
supposing that he knew, the plan of campaign, and that plan
jumping with his own bearish inclinations, he continued, on
his own account, operations looking to a fall. One may casily
conceive the wrath of the Erie operators at such a treacherous
policy; and it is not difficult to imagine their vows of vengeance.
Meanwhile all went well with Daniel Drew. Erie
looked worse and worse, and the golden harvest seemed drawing
near. By the middle of November he had contracted for
the delivery of some seventy thousand shares at current prices,
averaging, perhaps, 38, and probably was counting his gains.
He did not appreciate the full power and resources of his old
associates. On the 14th of November their tactics changed,
and he found himself involved in terrible entanglements,---
hopelessly cornered. His position disclosed itself on Saturday.
Naturally the first impulse was to have recourse to
the courts. An injunction --- a dozen injunctions --- could
be had for the asking, but, unfortunately, could be had by
both parties. Drew's own recent experience, and his intimate
acquaintance with the characters of Fisk and Gould, were not
calculated to inspire him with much confidence in the efficacy
of the law. But nothing else remained, and, after hurried
consultations among the victims, the lawyers were applied to,
the affidavits were prepared, and it was decided to repair on
the following Monday to the so-called courts of justice.

Nature, however, had not bestowed on Daniel Drew the
steady nerve and sturdy gambler's pride of either Vanderbilt
or of his old companions at Jersey City. His mind wavered
and hesitated between different courses of action. His only
care was for himself, his only thought was of his own position.
He was willing to betray one party or the other, as the case
might be. He had given his affidavit to those who were to
bring the suit on the Monday, but he stood perfectly ready to
employ Sunday in betraying their counsels to the defendants in
the suit. A position more contemptible, a state of mind more
pitiable, can hardly be conceived. After passing the night in
this abject condition, on the morning of Sunday he sought out
Mr. Fisk for purposes of self-humiliation and treachery.[^/69] He
then partially revealed the difficulties of his situation, only to
have his confidant prove to him how entirely he was caught,
by completing to him the revelation. He betrayed the secrets
of his new allies, and bemoaned his own hard fate; he was
thereupon comforted by Mr. Fisk with the cheery remark
that "he (Drew) was the last man who ought to whine over
any position in which he placed himself in regard to Erie."
The poor man begged to see Mr. Gould, and would take no
denial. Finally Mr. Gould was brought in, and the scene was
repeated for his edification. The two must have been satiated
with revenge. At last they sent him away, promising to see
him again that evening. At the hour named he again appeared,
and, after waiting their convenience, --- for they
spared him no humiliation, --- he again appealed to them,
offering them great sums if they would issue new stock or
lend him of their stock. He implored, he argued, he threatened.
At the end of two hours of humiliation, persuaded
that it was all in vain, that he was wholly in the power of antagonists
without mercy, he took his hat, said, "I will bid you
good night," and went his way.


[^/69]: It ought perhaps to be stated that this portion of the narrative has no
stronger foundation than an affidavit of Mr. Fisk, which has not, however,
been publicly contradicted.

There is a touch of nature about this scene which reads like
fiction. Indeed, it irresistibly recalls the feebler effort of
Dickens to portray Fagin's last night alive, and there is more
pathos in the parting address than in the Jew's, --- "An old
man, my lord! a very, very old man." But the truth is
stranger than fiction. Dickens did not dare picture the old
"fence" in Oliver Twist turned out of his own house and
stripped of his plunder by the very hands through which he
had procured it. In the case of Daniel Drew, however, the
ideal poetic justice was brought about in fact; the evil instructions
returned to plague the inventor, and it is hard to believe
that, as he left the Erie offices that night, his apt pupils, even
'as those of Fagin might have done, did not watch his retiring
steps with suppressed merriment; and, when the door had
closed upon him, that the one did not explode in loud bursts
of laughter, while the other, with a quiet chuckle, plunged
his hands into those capacious pockets which yawned for all
the wealth of Erie. Bad as all these things are, terrible as is
the condition of affairs only partially revealed, there is a grim
humor running through them which ever makes itself felt.

But to return to the course of events. With the lords of
Erie forewarned was forearmed. They knew something of the
method of procedure in New York courts of law. At this
particular juncture Mr. Justice Sutherland, a magistrate
of such pure character and unsullied reputation that it is
inexplicable how he ever came to be elevated to the bench on
which he sits, was holding chambers, according to assignment,
for the four weeks between the first Monday in November and
the first Monday in December. By a rule of the court, all
applications for orders during that time were to be made
before him, and he only, according to the courtesy of the
Bench, took cognizance of such proceedings. Some general
arrangement of this nature is manifestly necessary to avoid
continual conflicts of jurisdiction. The details of the assault
on the Erie directors having been settled, counsel' appeared
before Judge Sutherland on Monday morning, and petitioned
for an injunction restraining the Erie directors from any new
issue of stock or the removal of the funds of the company
beyond the jurisdiction of the court, and also asking that the
road be placed in the hands of a receiver. The suit was
brought in the name of Mr. August Belmont, who was supposed
to represent large foreign holders. The petition set
forth at length the alleged facts in the case, and was supported
by the affidavits of Mr. Drew and others. Mr. Drew
apparently did not inform the counsel of the manner in which
he had passed his leisure hours on the previous day; had he
done so, Mr. Belmont's counsel probably would have expedited
their movements. The injunction was, however, duly signed,
and, doubtless, immediately served.

Meanwhile Messrs. Gould and Fisk had not been idle. Applications
for injunctions and receiverships were a game which
two could play at, and long experience had taught these close
observers the very great value of the initiative in law. Accordingly,
some two hours before the Belmont application was
made, they had sought no less a person than Mr. Justice Barnard,
caught him, as it were, either in his bed or at his breakfast,
whereupon he had held a _lit de justice_, and made divers
astonishing orders. A petition was presented in the name
of one McIntosh, a salaried officer of the Erie Road, who
claimed also to be a shareholder. It set forth the danger
of injunctions and of the appointment of a receiver, the great
injury likely to result therefrom, etc. After due consideration
on the part of Judge Barnard, an injunction was issued, staying
and restraining all suits, and actually appointing Jay
Gould receiver, to hold and disburse the funds of the company
in accordance with the resolutions of the Board of Directors
and the Executive Committee. This certainly was a very
brilliant flank movement, and testified not less emphatically
to Gould's genius than to Barnard's law; but most of all did
it testify to the efficacy of the new combination between
Tammany Hall and the Erie Railway. Since the passage
of the bill "to legalize counterfeit money," in April, and
the present November, new light had burst upon the judicial
mind, and as the news of one injunction and a vague rumor
of the other crept through Wall Street that day, it was no
wonder that operators stood aghast and that Erie fluctuated
wildly from 50 to 61 and back to 48.

The Erie directors, however, did not rest satisfied with the
position which they had won through Judge Barnard's order.
That simply placed them, as it were, in a strong defensive
attitude. They were not the men to stop there they aspired
to nothing less than a vigorous offensive. With a superb audacity,
which excites admiration, the new trustee immediately
filed a supplementary petition. Therein it was duly set forth
that doubts had been raised as to the legality of the recent issue
of some two hundred thousand shares of stock, and that only
about this amount was to be had in America; the trustee therefore
petitioned for authority to use the funds of the corporation
to purchase and cancel the whole of this amount at any price
less than the par value, without regard to the rate at which it
had been issued. The desired authority was conferred by Mr.
Justice Barnard as soon as asked. Human assurance could go
no further. The petitioners had issued these shares in the
bear interest at 40, and had run down the value of Erie to
35; they had then turned round, and were now empowered
to buy back that very stock in the bull interest, and in the
name and with the funds of the corporation, at par. A law
of the State distinctly forbade corporations from operating in
their own stock; but this law was disregarded as if it had
been only an injunction. An injunction forbade the treasurer
from making any disposition of the funds of the company, and
this injunction was respected no more than the law. These
trustees had sold the property of their wards at 40; they
were now prepared to use the money of their wards to buy
the same property back at 80, and a judge had been found
ready to confer on them the power to do so. Drew could not
withstand such tactics, and indeed the annals of Wall Street
furnished no precedent or parallel. They might have furnished
one, but the opportunity had been lost. Had Robert
Schuyler not lived fifteen years too soon, --- had he, instead
of flying his country and dying broken-hearted in exile, boldly
attempted a change of front when his fraudulent issues had
filled Wall Street with panic, and had he sought to use the
funds of his company for a masterly upward movement in his
own manufactured stock, --- then, though in those uncultivated
and illiberal days his scheme might have come to naught, and
he himself might even have passed from the presence of an
indignant jury into the keeping of a surly jailer, at least he
would have evinced a mind in advance of his day, and could
have comforted himself with the assurance that he was the
first of a line of great men, and that the time was not far
distant when his name and his fame would be cherished
among the most brilliant recollections of Wall Street. But
Schuyler lived before his time!

When this last, undreamed-of act was made public on
Wednesday at noon, it was apparent that the crisis was not far
off. Daniel Drew was cornered. Erie was scarce and selling
at 47, and would not become plenty until the arrival of the English
steamer on Monday; and so, at 47, Mr. Drew flung himself
into the breach to save his endangered credit, and, under
his purchases, the stock rapidly rose, until at five o'clock
Wednesday afternoon it reached 57. Contrary to expectation,
the "corner" had not yet culminated. It became evident the
next morning that before two o'clock that day the issue would
be decided. Drew fought desperately. The Brokers' Board
was wild with excitement. High words passed; collisions
took place; the bears were savage, and the bulls pitiless.
Erie touched 62, and there was a difference of sixteen % between cash stock and stock sold to be delivered in
three days, --- when the steamer would be in, --- and a difference
of ten % between stock to be delivered on
the spot and that to be delivered at the usual time, which
was a quarter after two o'clock. Millions were handled like
thousands; fabulous rates of interest were paid; rumors of
legal proceedings were flying about, and forays of the Erie
chiefs on the Vanderbilt roads were confidently predicted.
New York Central suddenly shot up seven % under
these influences, and Vanderbilt seemed about to enter the
field. The interest of the stock market centred in the combatants
and on these two great corporations. All other stocks
were quiet and neglected while the giants were fighting it
out. The battle was too fierce to last long. At a quarter
before three o'clock the struggle would be over. Yet now, at
the very last moment, the prize which trembled before them
eluded the grasp of the Erie ring. Their opponent was not
saved, but they shared his disaster. Their combination had
turned on the fact, disclosed to them by the Erie books, that
some three hundred thousand shares of its stock had been
issued in the ten-share certificates which alone are transmitted
to London. This amount they supposed to be out of the
country; the balance they could account for as beyond the
reach of Drew. Suddenly, as two o'clock approached, and
Erie was trembling in the sixties, all Broadway --- every tailor
and boot-maker and cigar-vender of New York --- seemed pouring
into Broad Street, and each new-comer held eagerly before
him one or more of those ten-share certincates which should
have been in London. Not only this, but the pockets of the
agents of foreign bankers seemed bursting with them. Bedlam
had suddenly broken loose in Wall Street. It was absolutely
necessary for the conspirators to absorb this stock, to
keep it from the hands of Drew. This they attempted to do,
and manfully stood their ground, fighting against time. Suddenly,
when the hour had almost come, --- when five minutes
more would have landed them in safety, --- through one of
those strange incidents which occur in Wall Street and which
cannot be explained, they seemed smitten with panic. It is
said their bank refused to certify their checks for the suddenly
increased amount; the sellers insisted on having certified
checks, and, in the delay caused by this unforeseen difficulty,
the precious five minutes elapsed, and the crisis had passed.
The fruits of their plot had escaped them. Drew made good
his contracts at 57, the stock at once fell heavily to 42, and a
dull quiet succeeded to the excitement of the morning. The
hand of the government had made itself felt in Wall Street.

The Broad Street conflict was over, and some one had
reaped a harvest. Who was it? It was not Drew, for his
losses, apart from a ruined prestige, were estimated at nearly
a million and a half of dollars. The Erie directors were not the
fortunate men, for their only trophies were great piles of certificates
of Erie stock, which had cost them "corner" prices, and for
which no demand existed. If Drew's loss was a million and
a half, their loss was likely to be nearer three millions. Who,
then, were the recipients of these missing millions? There is
an ancient saying, which seems to have been tolerably verified
in this case, that when certain persons fall out certain other
persons come by their dues. The "corner" was very beautiful
in all its details, and most admirably planned; but, unfortunately,
those who engineered it had just previously made
the volume of stock too large for accurate calculation. For
once the outside public had been at hand and Wall Street had
been found wanting. A large portion of the vast sum taken
from the combatants found its way into the pockets of the
agents of English bankers, and a part of it was accounted for
by them to their principals; another portion went to relieve
anxious holders among the American outside public; the remainder
fell to professional operators, probably far more lucky
than sagacious. Still, there had been a fall before there was
a rise. The subsequent disaster, perhaps, no more than counterbalanced
the earlier victory; at any rate, Messrs. Gould
and Fisk did not succumb, but preserved a steady front, and
Erie was more upon the street than ever. In fact, it was
wholly there now. The recent operations had proved too
outrageous even for the Brokers' Board. A new rule was
passed, that no stock should be called, the issues of which
were not registered at some respectable banking-house. The
Erie directors declined to conform to this rule, and their road
was stricken from the list of calls. Nothing daunted at this,
these Protean ereatures at once organized a new board of
their own, and so far succeeded in their efforts as to have
Erie quoted and bought and sold as regularly as ever.

Though the catastrophe had taken place on the 19th, the
struggle was not yet over. The interests involved were so
enormous, the developments so astounding, such passions had
been aroused, that some safety-valve through which suppressed
wrath could work itself off was absolutely necessary, and this
the courts of law afforded. The attack was stimulated by
various motives. The _bona fide_ holders of the stock, especially
the foreign holders, were alarmed for the existence of
their property. The Erie ring had now boldly taken the position
that their duty was, not to manage the road in the interests
of its owners, not to make it a dividend-paying corporation,
but to preserve it from consolidation with the Vanderbilt
monopoly. This policy was openly proclaimed by Mr. Gould,
at a later day, before an investigating committee at Albany.
With unspeakable effrontery, --- an effrontery so great as actually
to impose on his audience and a portion of the press,
and make them believe that the public ought to wish him
success, --- he described how stock issues at the proper time,
to any required amount, could alone keep him in control of
the road, and keep Mr. Vanderbilt out of it; it would be his
duty, therefore, he argued, to issue as much new stock, at
about the time of the annual election, as would suffice to keep
a majority of all the stock in existence under his control; and
he declared that he meant to do this.[^/77] The strangest thing
of all was, that it never seemed to occur to his audience that
the propounder of this comical sophistry was a trustee and
guardian for the stockholders, and not a public benefactor;
and that the owners of the Erie Road might possibly prefer
not to be deprived of their property, in order to secure the
blessing of competition. So unique a method of securing a
re-election was probably never before suggested with a grave
face, and yet, if we may believe the reporters, Mr. Gould, in
developing it, produced a very favorable impression on the
committee. It was hardly to be expected that such advanced
views as to the duties and powers of railway directors would
favorably impress commonplace individuals who might not
care to have their property scaled down to meet Mr. Gould's
views of public welfare. These persons accordingly, popularly
supposed to be represented by Mr. Belmont, wished to
get their property out of the hands of such fanatics in the
cause of cheap transportation and plentiful stock, with the
least possible delay. Combined with these were the operators
who had suffered in the late "corner," and who desired to fight
for better terms and a more equal division of plunder. Behind
them all, Vanderbilt was supposed to be keeping an eager
eye on the long-coveted Erie. Thus the materials for litigation
existed in abundance.


[^/77]: Question to Mr. Gould. For the information of the committee, would
you give us your opinion as to the utility of that section of the general
railroad law, under which so many issues of convertible bonds have been
made?

Answer. I could only speak as to the Erie Road; that law saved the Erie
Road from bankruptcy; and as long as that law is unrepealed, I should do
what I did again. I should save the road. I think it is a good law.

Q. Is it not liable to abuse?

A. I have never known it to be abused; if that was repealed, I think that
Mr. Vanderbilt would have the road; but as long as it is not repealed it is held
_in terrorem_ over him.

Q. Suppose the section was amended so as to require the consent of the
stockholders?

A. Suppose he owned all the stock, what would be the difference?. ...

Q. What other effect would it (the repeal of Section 10) have?

A. I think it would lay the State open to a great monopoly, the greatest
the world has ever seen.

Much more followed in the same style. One remark of Mr. Gould's, however,
in this examination, bore the stamp of truth and perspicuity. It is recorded
as follows: "The Erie road won't be a dividend-paying road for a long
time on its common stock."


On Monday, the 23d, Judge Sutherland vacated Judge
Barnard's order appointing Jay Gould receiver, and, after
seven hours' argument and some exhibitions of vulgarity and
indecency on the part of counsel, which vied with those of
the previous April, he appointed Mr. Davies, an ex-chief justice
of the Court of Appeals, receiver of the road and its
franchise, leaving the special terms of the order to be settled
at a future day. The seven hours' struggle had not been
without an object; that day Judge Barnard had been peculiarly
active. The morning hours he had beguiled by the
delivery to the grand jury of one of the most astounding
charges ever recorded; and now, as the shades of evening
were falling, he closed the labors of the day by issuing a stay
of the proceedings then pending before his associate.[^/78] Tuesday
had been named by Judge Sutherland, at the time he
appointed his receiver, as the day upon which he would settle
the details of the order. His first proceeding upon that day,
on finding his action stayed by Judge Barnard, was to grant a
motion to show cause, on the next day, why Barnard's order
should not be vacated. This style of warfare, however, savored
altogether too much of the tame defensive to meet successfully
the bold strategy of Messrs. Gould and Fisk. They
carried the war into Africa. In the twenty-four hours during
which Judge Sutherland's order to show cause was pending
three new actions were commenced by them. In the first
place, they sued the suers. Alleging the immense injury
likely to result to the Erie Road from actions commenced, as
they alleged, solely with a view of extorting money in settlement,
Mr. Belmont was sued for a million of dollars in damages.
Their second suit was against Messrs. Work, Schell,
and others, concerned in the litigations of the previous spring,
to recover the $429,250 then paid them, as was alleged, in a
fraudulent settlement. These actions were, however, commonplace,
and might have been brought by ordinary men.
Messrs. Gould and Fisk were always displaying the invention
of genius. The same day they carried their quarrels into the
United States courts. The whole press, both of New York
and of the country, disgusted with the parody of justice
enacted in the State courts, had cried aloud to have the whole
matter transferred to the United States tribunals, the decisions
of which might have some weight, and where, at least,
no partisans upon the bench would shower each other with
stays, injunctions, vacatings of orders, and other such pellets
of the law. The Erie ring, as usual, took time by the forelock.
While their slower antagonists were deliberating, they
acted. On this Monday, the 23d, one Henry B. Whelpley,
who had been a clerk of Gould's, and who claimed to be a
stockholder in the Erie and a citizen of New Jersey, instituted
a suit against the Erie Railway before Judge Blatchford, of
the United States District Court. Alleging the doubts which
hung over the validity of the recently issued stock, he petitioned
that a receiver might be appointed, and the company
directed to transfer into his hands enough property to secure
from loss the plaintiff as well as all other holders of the new
issues. The Erie counsel were on the ground, and, as soon as
the petition was read, waived all further notice as to the matters
contained in it; whereupon the court at once appointed
Jay Gould receiver, and directed the Erie Company to place
eight millions of dollars in his hands to protect the rights
represented by the plaintiff. Of course the receiver was
required to give bonds with sufficient sureties. Among the
sureties was James Fisk, Jr. The brilliancy of this move
was only surpassed by its success. It fell like a bombshell in
the enemy's camp, and scattered dismay among those who
still preserved a lingering faith in the virtue of law as administered
by any known courts. The interference of the court
was in this case asked for on the ground of fraud. If any
fraud had been committed, the officers of the company alone
could be the delinquents. To guard against the consequences
of that fraud, a receivership was prayed for, and the court
appointed as receiver the very officer in whom the alleged.
frauds, on which its action was based, must have originated.
It is true, as was afterwards observed by Judge Nelson in setting
it aside, that a _prima facie_ case, for the appointment of a
receiver "was supposed to have been made out," that no objection
to the person suggested was made, and that the right
was expressly reserved to other parties to come into court,
with any allegations they saw fit against Receiver Gould.
The collusion in the case was, nevertheless, so evident, the
facts were so notorious and so apparent from the very papers
before the court, and the character of Judge Blatchford is so
far above suspicion, that it is hard to believe that this order
was not procured from him by surprise, or through the agency
of some counsel in whom he reposed a misplaced confidence.
The Erie ring, at least, had no occasion to be dissatisfied with
this day's proceedings.


[^/78]: The charge referred to is altogether too curious to be forgotten; it was
couched in the following terms:---

"GENTLEMEN OF THE GRAND JURY, --- I deem it not inappropriate at the
present time to call your attention to three or four subjects that, in my judgment,
the grand jury should look into: First, in regard to alleged frauds at
elections; second, in regard to the alleged corruptions of the judiciary here;
third, as to the action of certain newspapers in New York in perpetrating
daily and hourly libels. I had intended, gentlemen, at the commencement of
this term, to have gone over many of these subjects more fully than I can
now; but I am led to-day not to delay it any longer in consequence of the
annoyance I am subjected to by newspapers and letter-writers, not borne out,
of all sorts of vilifications and abuses for offences of which I certainly know
nothing, and see if the writers of some of these articles cannot be made to
come before you and substantiate some among the many of the different allegations
that they have made against the judge that now addresses you. In
to-day's Tribune and to-day's Times, along with articles in the Jersey papers
and elsewhere, are charges of the most atrocious character made against corruptions,
in interfering with the duties of electors, and charging the judge
with being in a combination in Wall Street. Now, it is unnecessary for me to
say to you that he never bought or sold or owned a share of stock in his life,
and as for the large fortune of $5,000,000 which one of the papers charges
him with being possessed of, he has not now nor did he ever have, belonging
to hin, separate from his wife, a single dollar's worth of property, and is today
dependent upon his salary as a judge and the charity of his wife; and
why these particular and atrocious charges at this particular time should be
made with such boldness and audacity is a matter I hope you as grand jurors,
whose duty it is, will look into, so that if you find them to be substantial, or
even a suspicion that they are true, that you will give the judge a chance to
resign. For infamy means one thing, and it ought to be ferreted out; and if a
man or a newspaper editor will sit down deliberately and make a charge
without any proof, let us see whether the rigor and terror of the law will not
stop this thing in future. For eleven years this judge has submitted to it
without any notice, and now, having arrived at a period of life when his usefulness
is impaired by such charges, he deems it his duty, and yours, gentlemen,
to look into the matter whenever you have leisure, and say whether a
combination of thieves, scoundrels, and rascals, who have infested Wall Street
and Broad Street for years, and are now quarrelling among themselves, shall be
permitted to turn around and endeavor to hide their own tracks by abuse and
vilification of the judge."

It may be interesting to record how this fulmination affected the papers
referred to. The Times the next morning commented on it as follows: "What
we have said and done in the matter we have said and done deliberately; . ...
we believe we have said nothing that is not true, and nothing that cannot be
proved to be true. At all events, we shall very willingly accept the responsibility
of establishing its truth and of vindicating ourselves from the judge's
imputations for having said it. A few days later it was reported that a true
bill had been found against the Times, and that paper on the 26th congratulated
the public on the fact. Finally, when Judge Barnard determined to drop
the matter, the Times, in its issue of December 1, discoursed as follows on
the subject: "We beg the judge to understand that we are quite ready to
meet the issue that he tendered us, and to respond to such an indictment as
he first urged the grand jury to find against us, or to a suit for damages,
which would, perhaps, better suit the deplorable condition of pecuniary
dependence to which he says he is reduced."

Nothing further came of the matter.

The next day Judge Sutherland made short work of his
brother Barnard's stay of proceedings in regard to the Davies
receivership. He vacated it at once, and incontinently proceeded,
wholly ignoring the action of Judge Blatchford on the
day before, to settle the terms of the order, which, covering
as it did the whole of the Erie property and franchise, excepting
only the operating of the road, bade fair to lead to a
conflict of jurisdiction between the State and Federal courts.
And now a new judicial combatant appears in the arena.
It is difficult to say why Judge Barnard, at this time, disappears
from the narrative. Perhaps the notorious judicial
violence of the man, which must have made his eagerness as
dangerous to the cause he espoused as the eagerness of a too
swift witness, had alarmed the Erie counsel. Perhaps the
fact that Judge Sutherland's term in chambers would expire
in a few days had made them wish to intrust their cause to
the magistrate who was to succeed him. At any rate, the
new order staying proceedings under Judge Sutherland's order
was obtained from Judge Cardozo, --- it is said, somewhat
before the terms of the receivership had been finally settled.
The change spoke well for the discrimination of those who
made it, for Judge Cardozo is a very different man from Judge
Barnard. Courteous but inflexible, subtle, clear-headed, and
unscrupulous, this magistrate conceals the iron hand beneath
the silken glove. Equally versed in the laws of New York and
in the mysteries of Tammany, he had earned his place by a
partisan decision on the excise law, and was nominated for the
bench by Mr. Fernando Wood, in a few remarks concluding as
follows: "Judges were often called on to decide on political
questions, and he was sorry to say the majority of them decided
according to their political bias. It was therefore
absolutely necessary to look to their candidate's political principles.
He would nominate, as a fit man for the office of Judge
of the Supreme Court, Albert Cardozo." Nominated as a
partisan, a partisan Cardozo has always been, when the occasion
demanded. Such was the new and far more formidable
champion who now confronted Sutherland, in place of the
vulgar Barnard. His first order in the matter --- to show
cause why the order of his brother judge should not be set
aside --- was not returnable until the 30th, and in the intervening
five days many events were to happen.

Immediately after the settlement by Judge Sutherland of
the order appointing Judge Davies receiver, that gentleman
had proceeded to take possession of his trust. Upon arriving
at the Erie building, he found it converted into a fortress, with
a sentry patrolling behind the bolts and bars, to whom was
confided the duty of scrutinizing all comers, and of admitting
none but the faithful allies of the garrison. It so happened
that Mr. Davies, himself unknown to the custodian, was accompanied
by Mr. Eaton, the former attorney of the Eric
corporation. This gentleman was recognized by the sentry,
and forthwith the gates flew open for himself and his companion.
In a few moments more the new receiver astonished
Messrs. Gould and Fisk, and certain legal gentlemen with
whom they happened to be in conference, by suddenly appearing
in the midst of them. The apparition was not agreeable.
Mr. Fisk, however, with a fair appearance of cordiality, welcomed
the strangers, and shortly after left the room. Speedily
returning, his manner underwent a change, and he requested.
the new-comers to go the way they came. As they did not
comply at once, he opened the door, and directed their attention
to some dozen men of forbidding aspect who stood outside,
and who, he intimated, were prepared to eject them
forcibly if they sought to prolong their unwelcome stay. As
an indication of the lengths to which Mr. Fisk was prepared
to go, this was sufficiently significant. The movement, however,
was a little too rapid for his companions; the lawyers
protested, Mr. Gould apologized, Mr. Fisk cooled down, and
his familiars retired. The receiver then proceeded to give
written notice of his appointment, and the fact that he had
taken possession; disregarding, in so doing, an order of Judge
Cardozo, staying proceedings under Judge Sutherland's order,
which one of the opposing counsel drew from his pocket, but
which Mr. Davies not inaptly characterized as a "very singular
order," seeing that it was signed before the terms of the
order it sought to affect were finally settled. At length, however,
at the earnest request of some of the subordinate officials,
and satisfied with the formal possession he had taken,
the new receiver delayed further action until Friday. He
little knew the resources of his opponents, if he vainly supposed
that a formal possession signified anything. The succeeding
Friday found the directors again fortified within, and
himself a much enjoined wanderer without. The vigilant
guards were now no longer to be beguiled. Within the building,
constant discussions and consultations were taking place;
without, elays of detectives incessantly watched the premises.
No rumor was too wild for public credence. It was confidently
stated that the directors were about to fly the State
and the country, --- that the treasury had already been conveyed
to Canada. At last, late on Sunday night, Mr. Fisk
with certain of his associates left the building, and made for
the Jersey Ferry; but on the way he was stopped by a vigilant
lawyer, and many papers were served upon him. His plans
were then changed. He returned to the office of the company,
and presently the detectives saw a carriage leave the Erie
portals, and heard a loud voice order it to be driven to the
Fifth Avenue Hotel. Instead of going there, however, it
drove to the ferry, and presently an engine, with an empty
directors' car attached, dashed out of the Erie station in Jersey
City, and disappeared in the darkness. The detectives
met and consulted; the carriage and the empty car were put
together, and the inference, announced in every New York
paper the succeeding day, was that Messrs. Fisk and Gould
had absconded with millions of money to Canada.

That such a ridiculous story should have been published,
much less believed, simply shows how utterly demoralized the
public mind had become, and how prepared for any act of highhanded
fraud or outrage. The libel did not long remain uncontradicted.
The next day a card from Mr. Fisk was telegraphed
to the newspapers, denying the calumny in indignant terms.
The eternal steel rails were again made to do duty, and the
midnight flitting became a harmless visit to Binghamton on
business connected with a rolling-mill. Judge Balcom, however,
of injunction memory in the earlier records of the Erie
suits, resides at Binghamton, and a leading New York paper
not inaptly made the timid inquiry of Mr. Fisk, "If he really
thought that Judge Balcom was running a rolling-mill of the
Erie Company, what did he think of Judge Barnard?" Mr.
Fisk, however, as became him in his character of the Mæcenas
of the bar, instituted suits claiming damages in fabulous sums,
for defamation of character, against some half-dozen of the
leading papers, and nothing further was heard of the matter,
nor, indeed, of the suits either. Not so of the trip to Binghamton.
On Tuesday, the 1st of December, while one set
of lawyers were arguing an appeal in the Whelpley case before
Judge Nelson in the Federal courts, and another set were procuring
orders from Judge Cardozo staying proceedings authorized
by Judge Sutherland, a third set were aiding Judge
Balcom in certain new proceedings instituted in the name of
the Attorney-General against the Erie Road. The result
arrived at was, of course, that Judge Balcom declared his to
be the only shop where a regular, reliable article in the way
of law was retailed, and then proceeded forthwith to restrain
and shut up the opposition establishments. The action was
brought to terminate the existence of the defendant as a
corporation, and, by way of preliminary, application was made
for an injunction and the appointment of a receiver. His
Honor held that, as only three receivers had as yet been appointed,
he was certainly entitled to appoint another. It was
perfectly clear to him that it was his duty to enjoin the defendant
corporation from delivering the possession of its road,
or of any of its assets, to either of the receivers already appointed;
it was equally clear that the corporation would be
obliged to deliver them to any receiver he might appoint.
He was not prepared to name a receiver just then, however,
though he intimated that he should not hesitate to do so if
necessary. So he contented himself with the appointment
of a referee to look into matters, and, generally, enjoined the
directors from omitting to operate the road themselves, or
from delivering the possession of it to "any person claiming
to be a receiver."

This raiding upon the agricultural judges was not peculiar
to the Erie party. On the contrary, in this proceeding it
rather followed than set an example; for a day or two previous
to Mr. Fisk's hurried journey, Judge Peckham of Albany
had, upon papers identical with those in the Belmont suit,
issued divers orders, similar to those of Judge Balcom, but on
the other side, tying up the Erie directors in a most astonishing
manner, and clearly hinting at the expediency of an additional
receiver to be appointed at Albany. The amazing part
of these Peckham and Balcom proceedings is, that they seem
to have been initiated with perfect gravity, and neither to have
been looked upon as jests, nor intended by their originators to
bring the courts and the laws of New York into ridicule and
contempt. Of course the several orders in these cases were
of no more importance than so much waste paper, unless,
indeed, some very cautious counsel may have considered an
extra injunction or two very convenient things to have in his
house; and yet, curiously enough, from a legal point of view,
those in Judge Balcom's court seem to have been almost the
only properly and regularly initiated proceedings in the whole
case.

These little rural episodes in no way interfered with a renewal
of vigorous hostilities in New York. While Judge
Balcom was appointing his referee, Judge Cardozo granted an
order for a reargument in the Belmont suit, --- which brought
up again the appointment of Judge Davies as receiver, --- and
assigned the hearing for the 6th of December. This step on
his part bore a curious resemblance to certain of his performances
in the notorious case of the Wood leases, and made the
plan of operations perfectly clear. The period during which
Judge Sutherland was to sit in chambers was to expire on the
4th of December, and Cardozo himself was to succeed him;
he now, therefore, proposed to signalize his associate's departure
from chambers by reviewing his orders. No sooner had
he granted the motion, than the opposing counsel applied to
Judge Sutherland, who forthwith issued an order to show
cause why the reargument ordered by Judge Cardozo should
not take place at once. Upon which the counsel of the Erie
Road instantly ran over to Judge Cardozo, who vacated Judge
Sutherland's order out of hand. The lawyers then left him
and ran back to Judge Sutherland with a motion to vacate
this last order. The contest was now becoming altogether too
ludicrous. Somebody must yield, and when it was reduced to
that, the honest Sutherland was pretty sure to give way to the
subtle Cardozo. Accordingly the hearing on this last motion
was postponed until the next morning, when Judge Sutherland
made a not undignified statement as to his position, and
closed by remitting the whole subject to the succeeding Monday,
at which time Judge Cardozo was to succeed him in
chambers. Cardozo, therefore, was now in undisputed possession
of the field. In his closing explanation Judge Sutherland
did not quote, as he might have done, the following
excellent passage from the opinion of the court, of which both
he and Cardozo were justices, delivered in the Schell case as
recently as the last day of the previous June: "The idea that
a cause, by such manœuvres as have been resorted to here, can
be withdrawn from one judge of this court and taken possession
of by another; that thus one judge of the same and
no other powers can practically prevent his associate from
exercising his judicial functions; that thus a case may be
taken from judge to judge whenever one of the parties fears
that an unfavorable decision is about to be rendered by the
judge who, up to that time, had sat in the cause, and that
thus a decision of a suit may be constantly indefinitely postponed
at the will of one of the litigants, only deserves to be
noticed as being a curiosity in legal tactics, --- a remarkable
exhibition of inventive genius and fertility of expedient to
embarrass a suit which this extraordinarily conducted litigation
has developed. ... Such a practice as that disclosed
by this litigation, sanctioning the attempt to counteract the
orders of each other in the progress of the suit, I confess is
new and shocking to me, ... and I trust that we have seen
the last in this high tribunal of such practices as this case has
exhibited. No apprehension, real or fancied, that any judge
is about, either wilfully or innocently, to do a wrong, can palliate,
much less justify it."[^/87] Neither did Judge Sutherland
state, as he might have stated, that this admirable expression
of the sentiments of the full bench was written and delivered
by Judge Albert Cardozo. Probably also Judge Cardozo and
all his brother judges, rural and urban, as they used these
bow-strings of the law, right and left,--- as their reckless
orders and injunctions struck deep into business circles far
beyond the limits of their State, --- as they degraded themselves
in degrading their order, and made the ermine of
supreme justice scarcely more imposing than the motley of the
clown,--- these magistrates may have thought that they had
developed at least a novel, if not a respectable, mode of conducting
litigation. They had not done even this. They had
simply, so far as in them lay, turned back the wheels of
progress and reduced the America of the nineteenth century
to the level of the France of the sixteenth. "The advocates
and judges of our times find bias enough in all causes to accommodate
them to what they themselves think fit. ...
What one court has determined one way another determines
quite contrary, and itself contrary to that at another time;
of which we see very frequent examples, owing to that practice
admitted among us, and which is a marvellous blemish to the
ceremonious authority and lustre of our justice, of not abiding
by one sentence, but running from judge to judge, and court
to court, to decide one and the same cause."[^/88]


[^/87]: _Schell v. Erie Railway Co._, 51 Barbour's S. C. 373, 374.

It was now very clear that Receiver Davies might abandon
all hope of operating the Erie Railway, and that Messrs.
Gould and Fisk were borne upon the swelling tide of victory.
The prosperous aspect of their affairs encouraged these lastnamed
gentlemen to yet more vigorous offensive operations.
The next attack was upon Vanderbilt in person. On Saturday,
the 5th of December, only two days after Judge Sutherland
and Receiver Davies were disposed of, the indefatigable Fisk
waited on Commodore Vanderbilt, and, in the name of the
Erie Company, tendered him fifty thousand shares of Erie
common stock at 70.[^/89] As the stock was then selling in Wall
Street at 40, the Commodore naturally declined to avail himself
of this liberal offer. He even went further, and, disregarding
his usual wise policy of silence, wrote to the New
York Times a short communication, in which he referred to the
alleged terms of settlement of the previous July, so far as
they concerned himself, and denied them in the following
explicit language: "I have had no dealings with the Erie
Railway Company, nor have I ever sold that company any
stock or received from them any _bonus_. As to the suits instituted
by Mr. Schell and others, I had nothing to do with
them, nor was I in any way concerned in their settlement."
This was certainly an announcement calculated to confuse the
public; but the confusion became confounded, when, upon the
10th, Mr. Fisk followed him in a card in which he reiterated
the alleged terms of settlement, and reproduced two checks
of the Erie Company, of July 11, 1868, made payable to the
treasurer and by him indorsed to C. Vanderbilt, upon whose
order they had been paid. These two checks were for the
sum of a million of dollars. He further said that the company
had a paper in Mr. Vanderbilt's own handwriting, stating
that he had placed fifty thousand shares of Erie stock in the
hands of certain persons, to be delivered on payment of
$3,500,000, which sum he declared had been paid. Undoubtedly
these apparent discrepancies of statement admitted of an
explanation; and some thin veil of equivocation, such as the
transaction of the business through third parties, justified
Vanderbilt's statements to his own conscience. Comment,
however, is wholly superfluous, except to call attention to the
amount of weight which is to be given to the statements and
denials, apparently the most general and explicit, which from
time to time were made by the parties to these proceedings.
This short controversy merely added a little more discredit to
what was already not deficient in that respect. On the 10th
of December the Erie Company sued Commodore Vanderbilt
for $3,500,000, specially alleging in their complaint the particulars
of that settlement, all knowledge of or connection
with which the defendant had so emphatically denied.


[^/88]: Montaigne's Works, Vol. II. p. 316.


[^/89]: Throughout these proceedings glimpses are from time to time obtained of
the more prominent characters in their undress, as it were, which have in them
a good many elements both of nature and humor. The following description
of the visit in which this tender was made was subsequently given by Fisk
on the witness-stand: "I went to his (Vanderbilt's) house; it was a bad,
stormy day, and I had the shares in a carpet-bag; I told the Commodore I
had come to tender 50,000 shares of Erie and wanted back the money which
we had paid for them and the bonds, and I made a separate demand for the
$1,000,000 which had been paid to cover his losses; he said he had nothing to
do with the Erie now, and must consult his counsel; ... Mr. Shearman
was with me: the date I don't know; it was about eleven o'clock in the morning:
don't know the day, don't know the month, don't know the year; I rode
up with Shearman, holding the carpet-bag tight between my legs; I told him
he was a small man and not much protection; this was dangerous property,
you see, and might blow up; . ... besides Mr. Shearman the driver went in
with the witnesses, and besides the Commodore I spoke with the servant-girl;
the Commodore was sitting on the bed with one shoe off and one shoe on;
... don't remember what more was said; I remember the Commodore put
on his other shoe; I remember those shoes on account of the buckles; you
see there were four buckles on that shoe, and I know it passed through my
mind that if such men wore that kind of shoe I must get me a pair; this
passed through my mind, but I did not speak of it to the Commodore; I was
very civil to him."

None of the multifarious suits which had been brought as
yet were aimed at Mr. Drew. The quondam treasurer had
apparently wholly disappeared from the scene on the 19th
of November. Mr. Fisk took advantage, however, of a leisure
day, to remedy this oversight, and a suit was commenced
against Drew, on the ground of certain transactions between
him, as treasurer, and the railway company, in relation to
some steamboats concerned in the trade of Lake Erie. The
usual allegations of fraud, breach of trust, and other trifling
and, technically, not State prison offences, were made, and
damages were set at a million of dollars.

Upon the 8th the argument in Belmont's case had been
reopened before Judge Cardozo in New York, and upon the
same day, in Oneida County, Judge Boardman, another justice
of the Supreme Court, had proceeded to contribute his share
to the existing complications. Counsel in behalf of Receiver
Davies had appeared before him, and, upon their application,
the Cardozo injunction, which restrained the receiver from
taking possession of the Erie Railway, had been dissolved.
Why this application was made, or why it was granted, surpasses
comprehension. However, the next day, Judge Boardman's
order having been read in court before Judge Cardozo,
that magistrate suddenly revived to a full appreciation of the
views expressed by him in June in regard to judicial interference
with judicial action, and at once stigmatized Judge
Boardman's action as "extremely indecorous." Neglecting,
however, the happy opportunity to express an opinion as to
his own conduct during the previous week, he simply stayed
all proceedings under this new order, and applied himself to
the task of hearing the case before him reargued.

This hearing lasted many days, was insufferably long and
inexpressibly dull. While it was going on, upon the 15th,
Judge Nelson, in the United States Court, delivered his opinion
in the Whelpley suit, reversing, on certain technical
grounds, the action of Judge Blatchford, and declaring that
no case for the appointment of a receiver had been made out;
accordingly he set aside that of Gould, and, in conclusion,
sent the matter back to the State court, or, in other words, to
Judge Cardozo, for decision. Thus the gentlemen of the ring,
having been most fortunate in getting their case into the Federal
court before Judge Blatchford, were now even more fortunate
in getting it out of that court when it had come before
Judge Nelson. After this, room for doubt no longer existed.
Brilliant success at every point had crowned the strategy
of the Erie directors. For once Vanderbilt was effectually
routed and driven from the field. That he shrunk from continuing
the contest against such opponents is much to his
credit. It showed that he, at least, was not prepared to see
how near he could come to the doors of a State prison and yet
not enter them; that he did not care to take in advance the
opinion of leading counsel as to whether what he meant to do
might place him in the felons' dock. Thus Erie was wholly
given over to the control of the ring. No one seemed any
longer to dispute their right and power to issue as much new
stock as might seem to them expedient. Injunctions had
failed to check them; receivers had no terrors for them. Secure
in their power, they now extended their operations over
sea and land, leasing railroads, buying steamboats, ferries,
theatres, and rolling-mills, building connecting links of road,
laying down additional rails, and, generally, proving themselves
a power wherever corporations were to be influenced or
legislatures were to be bought.

Christmas, the period of peace and good-will, was now
approaching. The dreary arguments before Judge Cardozo
had terminated on December 18, long after the press and
the public had ceased to pay any attention to them, and already
rumors of a settlement were rife. Yet it was not meet
that the settlement should be effected without some final
striking catastrophe, some characteristic concluding tableau.
Among the many actions which had incidentally sprung from
these proceedings was one against Mr. Samuel Bowles, the
editor of the Springfield Republican, brought by Mr. Fisk in
consequence of an article which had appeared in that paper,
reflecting most severely on Fisk's proceedings and private
character,--- his past, his present, and his probable future:
On the 22d of December, Mr. Bowles happened to be in New
York, and, as he was standing in the office of his hotel, talking
with a friend, was suddenly arrested on the warrant of
Judge McCunn, hurried into a carriage, and driven to Ludlow
Street Jail, where he was locked up for the night. This excellent
jest afforded intense amusement, and was the cause
of much wit that evening at an entertainment given by the
Tammany ring to the newly elected mayor of New York, at
which entertainment Mr. James Fisk, Jr., was an honored
guest. The next morning the whole press was in a state of
high indignation, and Mr. Bowles had suddenly become the
best-advertised editor in the country. At an early hour he
was, of course, released on bail, and with this outrage the
second Erie contest was brought to a close. It seemed right
and proper that proceedings which, throughout, had set public
opinion at defiance, and in which the Stock Exchange, the
courts, and the legislature had come in for equal measures
of opprobrium for their disregard of private rights, should be
terminated by an exhibition of petty spite, in which bench and
bar, judge, sheriff, and jailer, lent themselves with base subserviency
to a violation of the liberty of the citizen.

It was not until the 10th of February that Judge Cardozo
published his decision setting aside the Sutherland receivership,
and establishing on a basis of authority the right to
over-issue stock at pleasure. The subject was then as obsolete
and forgotten as though it had never absorbed the public
attention. And another "settlement" had already been
effected. The details of this arrangement have not been
dragged to light through the exposures of subsequent litigation.
But it is not difficult to see where and how a combination
of overpowering influence may have been effected, and a
guess might even be hazarded as to its objects and its victims.
The fact that a settlement had been arrived at was intimated
in the papers of the 26th of December. On the 19th of the
same month a stock dividend of eighty % in the New
York Central had been suddenly declared by Vanderbilt.
I'resently the legislature met. While the Erie ring seemed to
have good reasons for apprehending hostile legislation, Vancerbilt,
on his part, might have feared for the success of a bill
which was to legalize his new stock. But hardly a voice was
raised against the Erie men, and the bill of the Central was
safely carried through. This curious absence of opposition did
not stop here, and soon the two parties were seen united in an
active alliance. Vanderbilt wanted to consolidate his roads ;
the Erie directors wanted to avoid the formality of annual
elections. Thereupon two other bills went hastily through
this honest and patriotic legislature, the one authorizing the
Erie Board, which had been elected for one year, to classify
itself so that one fifth only of its members should vacate
office during each succeeding year, the other consolidating the
Vanderbilt roads into one colossal monopoly. Public interests
and private rights seem equally to have been the victims.
It is impossible to say that the beautiful unity of interests
which led to such results was the fulfilment of the December
settlement; but it is a curious fact that the same paper which
announced in one column that Vanderbilt's two measures,
known as the consolidation and Central scrip bills had gone to
the Governor for signature, should, in another, have reported
the discontinuance of the Belmont and Whelpley suits by the
consent of all interested.[^/93] It may be that public and private
interests were not thus balanced and traded away in a servile
legislature, but the strong probabilities are that the settlement
of December made white even that of July. Meanwhile the
conquerors --- the men whose names had been made notorious
through the whole land in all these infamous proceedings ---
were at last undisputed masters of the situation, and no man
questioned the firmness of their grasp on the Erie Railway.
They walked erect and proud of their infamy through the
streets of our great cities; they voluntarily subjected themselves
to that to which other depredators are compelled to
submit, and, by exposing their portraits in public conveyances,
converted noble steamers into branch galleries of a policeoffice;
nay, more, they bedizened their persons with gold lace,
and assumed honored titles, until those who witnessed in
silent contempt their strange antics were disposed to exclaim
in the language of poor Doll Tearsheet: "An Admiral! God's
light, these villains will make the word as odious as the word
'occupy,' which was an excellent good word before it was ill
sorted; therefore, Admirals had need look to 't."

The subsequent history of the Erie Railway, under the
management of the men who had thus succeeded in gaining
absolute control over it, forms no part of this narrative. The
attempt has been made simply to trace the course of events
which resulted in placing a national thoroughfare in the hands
of unscrupulous gamblers, and to describe the complications
which marked their progress to power. The end was finally
attained, when, after every opponent had, by fair means or by
foul, been driven from the conflict, that strange law was enacted
which assured these men, elected for one year, a five
years' term of power, beyond the control of their stockholders.
From that moment all the great resources of the Erie Railway
became mere engines with which to work their lawless will.

Comment would only weaken the force of this narrative.
It sufficiently suggests its own moral. The facts which have
been set forth cannot but have revealed to every observant
eye the deep decay which has eaten into our social edifice.
No portion of our system was left untested, and no portion
showed itself to be sound. The stock exchange revealed
itself as a haunt of gamblers and a den of thieves; the offices
of our great corporations appeared as the secret chambers in
which trustees plotted the spoliation of their wards; the law
became a ready engine for the furtherance of wrong, and the
ermine of the judge did not conceal the eagerness of the partisan;
the halls of legislation were transformed into a mart in
which the price of votes was higgled over, and laws, made to
order, were bought and sold; while under all, and through all,
the voice of public opinion was silent or was disregarded.

It is not, however, in connection with the present that all
this has its chief significance. It speaks ominously for the
future. It may be that our society is only passing through a
period of ugly transition, but the present evil has its root deep
down in the social organization, and springs from a diseased
public opinion. Failure seems to be regarded as the one unpardonable
crime, success as the all-redeeming virtue, the acquisition
of wealth as the single worthy aim of life. Ten years
ago such revelations as these of the Erie Railway would have
sent a shudder through the community, and would have
placed a stigma on every man who had had to do with them.
Now they merely incite others to surpass them by yet bolder
outrages and more corrupt combinations. Were this not so,
these things would be as impossible among us now as they are
elsewhere, or as they were here not many years ago. While
this continues it is mere weakness to attribute the consequences
of a lax morality to a defective currency, or seek to
prevent its outward indications by statute remedies. The root
of the disease is deep; external applications will only hide its
dangerous symptoms. It is well to reform the currency, it is
well to enact laws against malefactors; but neither the one
nor the other will restore health to a business community
which tolerates successful fraud, or which honors wealth more
than honesty.

One leading feature of these developments, however, is,
from its political aspect, especially worthy of the attention of
the American people. Modern society has created a class
of artificial beings who bid fair soon to be the masters of their
creator. It is but a very few years since the existence of a
corporation controlling a few millions of dollars was regarded
as a subject of grave apprehension, and now this country
already contains single organizations which wield a power represented
by hundreds of millions. These bodies are the creatures
of single States; but in New York, in Pennsylvania, in
Maryland, in New Jersey, and not in those States alone, they
are already establishing despotisms which no spasmodic popular
effort will be able to shake off. Everywhere, and at all
times, however, they illustrate the truth of the old maxim of
the common law, that corporations have no souls. Only in
New York has any intimation yet been given of what the
future may have in store for us should these great powers
become mere tools in the hands of ambitious, reckless men.
The system of corporate life and corporate power, as applied
to industrial development, is yet in its infancy. It tends
always to development, --- always to consolidation, --- it is ever
grasping new powers, or insidiously exercising covert influence.
Even now the system threatens the central government.
The Erie Railway represents a weak combination compared to
those which day by day are consolidating under the unsuspecting
eyes of the community. A very few years more, and
we shall see corporations as much exceeding the Erie and the
New York Central in both ability and will for corruption as
they will exceed those roads in wealth and in length of iron
track. We shall see these great corporations spanning the
continent from ocean to ocean, --- single, consolidated lines,
not connecting Albany with Buffalo, or Lake Erie with the
Hudson, but uniting the Atlantic and the Pacific, and bringing
New York nearer to San Francisco than Albany once was to
Buffalo. Already the disconnected members of these future
leviathans have built up States in the wilderness, and chosen
their attorneys senators of the United States. Now their
power is in its infancy; in a very few years they will re-enact,
on a larger theatre and on a grander scale, with every feature
magnified, the scenes which were lately witnessed on the narrow
stage of a single State. The public corruption is the
foundation on which corporations always depend for their
political power. There is a natural tendency to coalition between
them and the lowest strata of political intelligence and
morality; for their agents must obey, not question. They
exact success, and do not cultivate political morality. The
lobby is their home, and the lobby thrives as political virtue
decays. The ring is their symbol of power, and the ring is
the natural enemy of political purity and independence. All
this was abundantly illustrated in the events which have just
been narrated. The existing coalition between the Erie Railway
and the Tammany ring is a natural one, for the former
needs votes, the latter money. This combination now controls.
the legislature and courts of New York; that it controls also
the Executive of the State, as well as that of the city, was
proved when Governor Hoffman recorded his reasons for signing
the infamous Erie Directors' Bill. It is a new power, for
which our language contains no name. We know what aristocracy,
autocracy, democracy are; but we have no word to
express government by moneyed corporations. Yet the people
already instinctively seek protection against it, and look for
such protection, significantly enough, not to their own legislatures,
but to the single autocratic feature retained in our
system of government, --- the veto by the Executive. In this
there is something more imperial than republican. The people
have lost faith in themselves when they cease to have any
faith in those whom they uniformly elect to represent them.
The change that has taken place in this respect of late years
in America has been startling in its rapidity. Legislation is)
more and more falling into contempt, and this not so much on
account of the extreme ignorance manifested in it as because
of the corrupt motives which are believed habitually to actuate
it. Thus the influence of corporations and of class interests
is steadily destroying that belief in singleness of purpose
which alone enables a representative government to exist, and
the community is slowly accustoming itself to look for protection,
not to public opinion, but to some man in high place
and armed with great executive powers. Him they now think
they can hold to some accountability. It remains to be
seen what the next phase in this process of gradual development
will be. History never quite repeats itself, and, as was
suggested in the first pages of this narrative, the old familiar
enemies may even now confront us, though arrayed in such a
modern garb that no suspicion is excited. Americans are apt
pupils, and among them there are probably some who have
not observed Fisk and Vanderbilt and Hoffman without a
thought of bettering their instructions. No successful military
leader will repeat in America the threadbare experiences
of Europe; --- the executive power is not likely to be seized
while the legislative is suppressed. The indications would
now seem rather to point towards the corruption of the legislative
and a quiet assumption of the executive through some
combination in one vigorous hand of those influences which
throughout this narrative have been seen only in conflict.
As the Erie ring represents the combination of the corporation
and the hired proletariat of a great city; as Vanderbilt embodies
the autocratic power of Cæsarism introduced into corporate
life, and as neither alone can obtain complete control
of the government of the State, it, perhaps, only remains for
the coming man to carry the combination of elements one
step in advance, and put Cæsarism at once in control of the
corporation and of the proletariat, to bring our vaunted institutions
within the rule of all historic precedent.

It is not pleasant to take such views of the future; yet
they are irresistibly suggested by the events which have been
narrated. They seem to be in the nature of direct inferences.
The only remedy lies in a renovated public opinion; but no
indication of this has as yet been elicited. People did indeed,
at one time, watch these Erie developments with interest, but
the feeling excited was rather one of amazement than of indignation.
Even where a real indignation was excited, it led
to no sign of any persistent effort at reform; it betrayed itself
only in aimless denunciation or in sad forebodings. The
danger, however, is day by day increasing, and the period during
which the work of regeneration should begin grows always
shorter. It is true that evils ever work their own cure, but
the cure for the evils of Roman civilization was worked out
through ten centuries of barbarism. It remains to be seen
whether this people retains that moral vigor which can alone
awaken a sleeping public opinion to healthy and persistent
activity, or whether to us also will apply these words of the
latest and best historian of the Roman republic: "What Demosthenes
said of his Athenians was justly applied to the
Romans of this period; that people were very zealous for
action so long as they stood round the platform and listened
to proposals of reform; but, when they went home, no one
thought further of what he had heard in the market-place.
However those reformers might stir the fire, it was to no purpose,
for the inflammable material was wanting."[^/99]
