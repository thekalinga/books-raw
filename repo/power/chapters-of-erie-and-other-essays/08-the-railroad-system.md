# The Railroad System[^/334]

## The Era of Change

Upon the 7th of August, in the year 1807, Robert Fulton,
with his little party of anxious and doubting guests on
board the "Claremont," cast off from the piers of New York,
and the waters of the Hudson were first troubled by the strokes
of the steam-paddle. There are few Americans at least who
have not lingered over the story and shared in the excitement
of that famous voyage ; --- dwelling upon its every detail from
the moment the clumsy little steamer --- big with the fate of
commercial marines and of navies --- left her wharf at New
York, until the steeples of Albany shone in the distance.

Twenty-two years later the corollary to this great event was
worked out in England. Popular biographers have made the
world even more familiar with the incidents of this second
memorable day than are Americans with the story of Fulton's
voyage. On the 6th of October, 1829, George Stephenson, an
ex-stoker and a graduate of the coal-mines of Northumberland,
but withal one of the most vigorous intellects which
England, rich as she has been in that class of products, has
ever given to the world, --- upon that day Stephenson drove
his little experimental locomotive "The Rocket" from Manchester
to Liverpool and back. "The Rocket" weighed only
four tons and a quarter, but Stephenson showed that it could
move at a rate of thirty miles an hour, and upon that day the
modern railroad system was born.


[^/334]: By CHARLES F. ADAMS, Jr. Much of the material used in the preparation
of this paper originally appeared in the following articles in the North
American Review: The Railroad System, April, 1868; Railroad Inflation,
January, 1869; Railroad Problems in 1869, January, 1870; The Government
and the Railroad Corporations, January, 1871.

At exactly the same time, in this country, the Cumberland
Turnpike and its construction was a fiercely agitated political
question. It was part of a great system of internal improvements
then contemplated; and, in identifying himself with it,
Henry Clay doubtless thought that he had imperishably connected
his memory with a monument more enduring than
bronze,--- with the Appian Way of America. The ambition
was an honorable one; all human experience justified his
faith in the permanence of the foundations upon which he
rested it. From a period long before the Christian Era down
to the year 1829 there had been no essential change in the
system of internal communication. At present, before another
half century has yet elapsed, the Cumberland Turnpike is as
antiquated as the Appian Way, --- as useful, perhaps, but far
less interesting.

As to the railroad system, it long ago became impossible
exactly to compute the number of miles contained in it or the
millions of capital which its construction had cost; it is very
difficult upon either of these points to arrive at conclusions
even approximately correct. Neither where the attempt is
made is the result at all encouraging. The mind fails to grasp
propositions of such magnitude; the mere piling up of numbers
conveys no new idea. For present purposes it may, in
round numbers, be said that in 1870 there were about 125,000
miles of railroad in the two hemispheres, constructed at an
average cost of little less than $100,000 per mile, and thus
representing hardly less than twelve thousand million dollars
of invested capital. All this has grown out of the thirty-two
miles of road alone in existence just forty years ago.

These figures are certainly sufficiently startling; but, large
as they are, they are increasing at a constantly accelerating
rate. Thirty years ago in this country we constructed annually
some 500 miles of road; twenty years ago this amount
had increased to 1,500, and as recently as ten years ago, it
had scarcely reached 2,000; now we build 6,000, and in the
year 1871 it is stated that enterprises involving 20,000 miles
of road and eight hundred million of dollars are simultaneously
going forward to completion.

Though this material or financial aspect of the system is
that which is almost invariably dwelt upon, it is by no means
the most interesting one. Here is an enormous, an incalculable
force practically let loose suddenly upon mankind; exercising
all sorts of influences, social, moral, and political; precipitating
upon us novel problems which demand immediate
solution; banishing the old before the new is half matured to
replace it; bringing the nations into close contact before yet
the antipathies of race have begun to be eradicated; giving
us a history full of changing fortunes and rich in dramatic
episodes. Yet, with the curious hardness of a material age,
we rarely regard this new power otherwise than as a moneygetting
and time-saving machine. We know sufficiently well
the number of passengers and of tons of freight which the railroad
system annually moves; we know how much it cost, we
guess at what it will return; but not many of those who deal
in its securities, or live by means of it, or legislate for it, or
who fondly believe they control it, ever stop to think of it as,
with perhaps two exceptions, the most tremendous and farreaching
engine of social change which has ever either blessed
or cursed mankind.

It cannot, therefore, be time wasted to look for a while at
the new agent or master from the other point of view, --- to
consider how it has already affected human interests. Some
such discipline is absolutely necessary before any one can be
at all fitted to approach the very difficult problems arising out
of it which are certainly in store for us, both socially and politically,
in our immediate future. Perhaps if the existing
community would take now and then the trouble to pass in
review the changes it has already witnessed it would be less
astounded at the revolutions which continually do and continually
must flash before it; perhaps also it might with more
grace accept the inevitable, and cease from useless attempts at
making a wholly new world conform itself to the rules and
theories of a bygone civilization.

Among the transformations effected by steam-locomotion,
perhaps the most obvious of all is the rapid enlargement of
the area of civilization. Emigration has recently passed into
a new phase of development, under which it might almost
be said that entire nations have been mobilized. Until as
recently as the year 1847, the old Phoenician method of colonization,
somewhat improved in details, yet prevailed. As
the Greeks sent out colonies to the Egean isles, to Asia
Minor, and to Sicily, --- as the Romans conquered the barbarians,
and then held them as colonists, --- so the Spanish, the
Dutch, the French, and the English planted their offshoots
in every quarter of the globe called uncivilized. In some
regions, as in the East, they held races in subjection, and fostered
colonies of the Roman type, while in others they established
feeble settlements on the model of the Greeks. As a
rule, the growth of these colonies was as slow in the modern as
it had been in the ancient times. By no means was it always
even rapid enough to be healthy. A few, in the long course
of years, struggled through the vicissitudes of infancy and
became flourishing communities; many languished, and many
died. The law of their progression through twenty centuries
had continued essentially the same.

At length, in 1846, vague rumors of regions rich beyond all
precedent in golden ores, and only then discovered on the
shores of the Pacific, pervaded the whole civilized globe, and,
under the influence of steam, a new phase of colonization at
once developed itself. To the new gold-fields rushed whole
populations, and forthwith steam became their servant, and
bound them closely with the older world. Where yesterday
had been a wilderness, California and Australia took their
places among the communities of the globe. The new era was
making itself felt, and, under its fostering impulse, communities
sprang into life full grown. Without the assistance of
steam, settlements would probably have been established, and
lingered in slow growth, along the shores of the sea and on the
banks of navigable rivers; but the steamboat and the locomotive
lent their aid, and the very Arabs of civilization became
substantial communities. So far as the inducement of gold
was concerned, the same process now going on upon both slopes
of the Rocky Mountains was witnessed in the colonization of
Mexico and Cuba. With Cuba it succeeded, as the ocean connected
the colonist with the world; with Mexico it failed, because
colonization was too rapid to be healthy, and the scattered
emigrants, cut off from and unsupported by the intercourse
of their kind, merged into, and both degraded and were
degraded by, the semi-civilization of the aborigines. Such was
not the case with Nevada. The discovery of some black-looking,
heavy fragments of stone in the uninhabited, hideous
region of the Great Basin suddenly revealed to the world in
1859 the existence of that famous Comstock lode, which almost
at once called a State into existence. Mining-camps, towns,
and even cities started up like mushrooms and at once experienced
the influence of the new law of civilization. No long,
wearisome, and dangerous wagon-road, scarcely marked out
across the plains, connected a nomadic population of semi-barbarous,
undomesticated men with a distant civilization which
was to them as a dream of their childhood; but, almost at
once, the ringing grooves of the railroad merged them with the
denser populations of the East and West. So the new era of
material development, by a process of its own, is peopling and
subduing the wilds of America and Australia. This is the
present exemplification of a law which dates back only twenty
years.

What other possible exemplifications of it await us? California
and Australia have revealed their secrets ; --- how long
will those of Mexico and South America and Africa remain
concealed? The application of the new process of development
to Mexico and South America can only be a question of
time; already begun, it must go on. But as yet Africa can but
be accounted among the possibilities of the future. Let it
once share the fate, as it one day may well do, of California or
of Australia, let it once reveal a hidden wealth, which somewhere
surely exists, and those now living may see the solution
of its enigma. Now, such a result is but a dream; but
it is a dream far less strange than the Australian and Californian
facts of the last twenty years.

We are always inclined to look upon the world as finished,
upon known forces as having produced their final results; but
results are never complete. Perhaps in 1481 the thinkers
of that day may have considered that the printing-press had
expended its force as a new power; and in 1522 philosophers
may have supposed that the ultimate material effects
of geographical discovery could be approximately estimated.
But, while it is given to ordinary men to see the full fruits
of their own action, the seed sown by men of genius, though
it may germinate early, arrives at its maturity only with a
distant posterity. The discoveries of Guttenberg and Columbus
have produced more startling and more clearly defined
results upon the destinies of the human race within the last
twenty-five years than in any other equal period of time
during the four previous centuries. So will it be with the
discovery made by Watt, and its applications by Fulton and
Stephenson. A remote civilization in central Africa or South
America may perhaps hereafter gauge its whole influence in
subduing the wilderness and forcing its secrets from the innermost
recesses of nature, but the casting up of that balance
sheet will not fall to the lot of this century.

Yet the extent of the change wrought by the new force upon
the limits of civilization has hardly been greater than that
which has been effected in manners and habits of thought.
Whatever constantly enters into the daily life soon becomes
an unnoticed part of it, and the infinitely varied influences of
the railroad system are so much a part of our everyday acts
and thoughts that they have become familiar, and have ceased
to be marvellous. The changes have been so gradual that we
have failed to notice their completeness. Yet most people who
observe at all have vaguely felt that there was some element
which made the present century different from all others, ---
a century of surprises. The young have found things different
upon attaining manhood from what they remembered in
their youth; the middle-aged have wondered if change flashed
in the eyes of their fathers as it has in their own; and the
old can easily remember a period less removed from the
Middle Ages than from the passing year. Our times are not
as those of our fathers.

No power has been so great as to be able to defy the
influence of the new force at work, and no locality so obscure
as to escape it. From the most powerful of European
monarchies to the most insignificant of New England villages,
the revolution has been all-pervading. Abroad and at
home it has equally nationalized people and cosmopolized
nations. The chief bonds of nationality are unities of race,
of language, of interest, and of thought. The tendency of
steam has universally been towards the gravitation of the
parts to the centre, --- towards the combination and concentration
of forces, whether intellectual or physical. Increased
communication, increased activity, and increased facilities of
trade destroy local interests, local dialects, and local jealousies.
The days of small barrier kingdoms and intricate balances of
power are wellnigh numbered. Whatever is homogeneous is
combining all the world over in obedience to an irresistible
law. It is the law of gravitation applied to human affairs.
One national centre regulates the whole daily thought, trade,
and language of great nations, and regulates it instantly. In
this way, France and England are already bound as closely
into two compact wholes, as were formerly the parishes of
London or the arrondissements of Paris. The same law is revolutionizing
Italy. In that country the long-scattered elements
of homogeneity, --- long kept by foreign influence apart, and
in a condition of artificial hostility and jealousy, --- yielding
with hard struggle to the new influence, are at last drawn
together, and are combining with each other as by chemical
affinity. Cavour had destiny on his side, and Austria struggled
against fate. But for steam the fate of Italy would yet
be more than doubtful. Local jealousies, foreign influence,
and domestic treason might well destroy all that has been
effected. Sicily might be set up against Sardinia, and Tuscany
against Rome. But every mile of completed railroad
takes for Italian unity a new bond of fate, --- banishes a little
more of local jealousy, local interest, and local dialect, and,
without the aid of a leader, completes the unfinished task of a
statesman.

The same phenomena and the same results are witnessed in
northern Europe. The nationalities gravitate. The old, artificial,
evil barriers set up by dynasties upon certain inhuman
theories as to the balance of powers are visibly breaking down.
All Germany, to its own great amazement, finds itself irresistibly
drawn towards Prussia, and Prussia will very shortly, not
less to its own amazement, find itself Germanized.
A power
stronger than diplomacy or statecraft is steadily and silently
at work; but while, in one locality, it compels to union, in
another it tears asunder. Germany unites, but Austria, made
up of discordant elements which for centuries have been retained
under one head by a skilfully contrived and artificially
stimulated antagonism and jealousy of forces, rapidly finds her
position becoming untenable. The Hun, the Croat, and the
Transylvanian will not combine. They have no affinities of
race, of language, or of interest, --- the ingredients will not
mix. To yield the popular reforms insures disintegration : to
resist them provokes revolution. The revolutions of the
steam-engine have at last rendered forever impracticable the
traditional policy of the house of Hapsburg.

The same new elements are rapidly working out its problems
for Russia. Not twenty years ago all Europe was perplexed
and alarmed by the growth and imagined power of the
empire of the Czars. The seeds of destruction seemed, however,
to lie hidden in the very successes of power. It might
well be deemed impossible that the vast, incongruous, overgrown
empire could remain united from the Baltic to the
Bosporus. All this is now changed. Within the last few
years only, --- brought to it in great degree by the disasters
of the Crimea, --- the ingredients have been cast into the crucible.
Railroads are in course of construction all over the
country, and, under their influence, the affinities day by day
unite. In a few years Constantinople will be nearer to St.
Petersburg than Moscow once was, and the whole great nation
will be bound together hard and fast by the iron bands.

On this continent, our own country is the child of the locomotive.
With us it has neither combined homogeneous elements,
nor forced into conflict those that were incongruous,
but it has rapidly disseminated one element over a vast wilderness.
The steamboat and railroad alone have rendered
existing America possible.

Such are some of the results of peace. The same force
has left a deep mark on the results of modern warfarc, --- a
mark no less noticeable from its absence than from its presence.
The history of two recent wars, not ten years apart,
perfectly illustrates the possible differences of result arising
from the regard or disregard of this new element of power.
These two are the war in the Crimea and our own Rebellion.
Russia failed of success in the Crimea, because she could not
avail herself of the steam-engine; the Allies succeeded, because
they could avail themselves of the steam-ship. Marseilles
and Plymouth were infinitely nearer to Sebastopol than
were Moscow and St. Petersburg. The new element of force
and combination, neglected by Russia in 1854, we availed ourselves
of with decisive effect in 1864. That one new element
of power --- wholly left out of their calculations by European
military authorities in exercising the gifts of prophecy on the
result of our struggle --- was the one element which made
possible the results we accomplished. They told us of the
vastness of the territory to be subdued, of the impossibility of
sustaining our armies, of the power of a people acting on the
defensive. They pointed to Napoleon's dismal experience in
Russia, and wondered and sneered at those who would not
learn from the experience of others, or profit from the disasters
of the past. They could not realize, and would take no
count of, the improved appliances of the age. The result the
world knows. It saw a powerful enemy's very existence depending
upon a frail thread of railroad iron, with the effectual
destruction of which perished all hope of resistance; it saw
Sherman's three hundred miles of rear, and the base and supplies
of eighty thousand fighting men in security three days'
journey by rail away from the sound of strife; it saw two
whole army corps, numbering eighteen thousand men, moved,
with all their munitions and a portion of their artillery, thirteen
hundred miles round the circumference, of a vast theatre
of war, from Virginia to Tennessee, in the moment of danger,
and this too in the apparently incredibly brief space of
only seven days. From Alexander to Napoleon, the possibilities
of combination in warfare were in essentials the same.
Within thirty years of the death of Napoleon, that was accomplished
which to him would have read as the tale of some
Arabian Night. The changes of thirty years threw deep into
the shade those of thirty centuries.

All those yet referred to are but the interior circles of the
influences already perceptible from the disturbing action of
this one new force. It does not confine itself to nationalizing
each severed race, but it cosmopolizes nations. It is in this
respect, perhaps, that the world is brought face to face with
the most subtle and disturbing influence of its new era, --- an
influence of which the early quickenings are but now making
themselves felt, and the complete development of which must
be the work of another century. As a result of the frequent
and easy intercourse among the nations which has existed of
late, --- the rapid exchange both of thought and of presence,---
there has arisen a steady and increasing tendency towards a
union of sympathetic forces, overcoming the barriers of language,
habit, and race. New questions are looming up, involving
the social relations and the division of the fruits of industry,
which are common to all countries, and which bid fair in great
degree to supersede questions of local interest. The two great
permanent parties into which mankind must always be divided
are thus brought vividly into the foreground carrying on their
struggle over these problems in a way hitherto unknown. The
innovators strive to combine the world over. They regard the
peculiar class of questions with which they concern themselves
as overriding all considerations of religion or nationality,---
the ancient sheet-anchors of society. They hold international
congresses and organize international associations, thus seeking
gradually to create a government within existing governments.
The end they keep ever in view is such a close concentration
of forces as shall enable them to act with decisive
effect upon any point of immediate conflict. Meanwhile the
party of conservatism, divided by traditional lines, seeks continually
to effect the impossible by struggling to preserve forms
from which the life has gone out. Hence results a period of
transition, marked by a state of human affairs almost wholly
wanting in the one element which mankind most eagerly
covets, that of stability. The party of attack does not as yet
know what it really desires, and the party of resistance mainly
sustains itself by virtue of the blunders of its opponents. It
would be wholly futile to philosophize over the possible results
of this wide array of forces. So far as the facilities of
intercourse affect them, the issue would seem to be, whether,
in the process of time, a unity of end among men may be
brought to override the prejudice of race. The most advanced
portions of the world are unquestionably still far from any
such result; this description of mobilization is hardly yet
begun. At the same time passing events in Europe would
seem to indicate that the seed may now be sown broadcast,
which is destined to grow until it shall shatter the whole fabric
of modern society.

Hitherto this tendency to assimilation has expended itself
in the reduction of differences. Much in the way of destruction
yet remains to be done before the plan of construction
can reveal itself. Meanwhile an incessant wearing away of
individual characteristics is very perceptible. More notably is
this the case as regards the outward aspect of civilized countries.
Since 1830 all the world travels. Already the whole Caucasian
race looks alike and talks alike, and is rapidly growing
to live alike and to think alike. We mix and mingle, until
there is no strangeness left. Those of middle life yet remember
Paris and London in the days of the diligence and the
stage-coach; and Rome has come directly within the influence
of railroads only within the last ten years; but, after all, the
mushroom cities of America, in their very brick and mortar,
--- in the architecture of their buildings and the age of their
walls, --- are the same in appearance, and just as ancient, as
modern London or Paris. We dream of England as old; we
dwell upon the descriptions of English humorists, and picture
to ourselves the quaint rambling inns and familiar streets of
Dickens, --- the haunts of Dr. Johnson and of Boswell, --- the
spots made familiar by Irving and his great progenitor who
showed old Sir Roger the sights of the town; we insensibly
associate with modern London, in childlike fancy, the familiar
scenes of English literature, from Prince Hal and Jack Falstaff
at the Boar's Head Inn to Mr. Pickwick snuffing the morning
air in Goswell Street. We still go to that city vaguely
expecting to find the quaintness we imagine; at any rate,
we do not look for what we left behind us in America.
Probably some of this quaintness did until recently linger
about London. But though 1829 did not work all its changes
at once, the old and quaint went out with stage-coaches. Today
we might as well look for traces of the Indians on Boston
Common, or of the renowned Wouter Van Twiller on
Manhattan Island. Paris and London have yielded to the
new influence, and are giving up their distinctive characteristics,
to become the stereotyped railroad centres of the future.
Rome, under the influence of the Papacy, resisted the revolution
a little longer; and there, until recently, the traveller
could yet dwell a moment with the past, and enjoy an instant's
forgetfulness of the wearying march of progress. But even
there the shrill scream of the steam-whistle broke the silence
of the Campagna, and a steam-engine had possession of the
palace of the Cenci.

At home, too, we notice similar change. The Revolution
has swept away the last vestiges of colonial thoughts and
persons. Who that has ever formerly lived in a New England
country town does not remember its old quiet and dulness,
its industry, the slow, steady growth of its prosperity,
and the staidness of its inhabitants? There, also, you met a
class of men now wholly gone,--- dull, solid, elderly men, men
of some property and few ideas, --- the legitimate descendants
of the English broad-acred squires. They were the gentry,
--- the men who went up to the General Court, and had been
members of the Governor's Council; they were men of formal
bearing and of formal dress, --- men who remembered Governor
Hancock, and had a certain trace of his manners. To-day this
class is extinct. Railroads have abolished them and their
dress and their habits, --- they have abolished the very houses
they dwelt in. The race of hereditary gentry has gone forever,
and the race of hereditary business-men has usurped its
place. They represent the railroad, as the earlier type did
the stage-coach.

The same phenomena are witnessed in the regions of thought.
It is bolder than of yore. It exerts its influence with a speed
and force equally accelerated. The newspaper press is the
great engine of modern education; and that press, obeying
the laws of gravitation, is everywhere centralized,--- the rays
of light once scattered are concentrated into one all-powerful
focus. To-day's metropolitan newspaper, printed by a steampress,
is whirled three hundred miles away by a steam-engine
before the day's last evening edition is in the hands of the
carrier. The local press is day by day fighting a losing cause
with diminished strength, while the metropolitan press drives
it out of circulation and filches from it its brain. Ideas are
quickly exchanged, and act upon each other. Nations can no
longer, except wilfully, persist in national blunders. Literatures
can no longer lie hid as did the German until so few
years ago. Since 1830 the nations are woven together by the
network of iron, and all thought and results of thought are
in common. The same problems perplex at once the whole
world, and from every quarter light floods in upon their solution.
But increased communication has not alone quickened
and intensified thought, it has revolutionized its process.
One great feature of the future must be the rapid uprising
of new communities. Of all such communities questioning
is a leading characteristic. They have neither faith in, nor
reverence for, that which is old. On the contrary, with them
age is a strong _prima facie_ evidence of badness, and they love
novelty for novelty's sake. This mental inclination will ultimately
apply the last test to truth, for error has its full chance
and is sure of a trial. The burden of proof seems likely to be
shifted from the innovator to the conservator.

It is in the domains of trade, however, that the revolution
is the most apparent and bewildering, --- that the sequences
of cause and effect are most innumerable and interminable.
Herbert Spencer says that it would require a volume to trace
through all its ramifications the contingent effects of the everyday
act of lighting a fire. These effects are imperceptible, but
the influence of steam locomotion as applied to trade is as
apparent as it is infinite. In this respect steam has proved
itself to be not only the most obedient of slaves, but likewise
the most tyrannical of masters. It pulls down as well as
builds up. The very forces of nature do not stand in its way.
It overcomes the wind and tide, and abolishes the Mississippi
River. It is as whimsical as it is powerful. The individual it
carries whithersoever he will, but whole communities it carries
whither they would not. It makes the grass grow in the once
busy streets of small commercial centres, like Nantucket, Salem,
and Charleston. It robs New Orleans of that monopoly
of wealth which the Mississippi River once promised to pour
into her lap. It threatens to make a solitude of the once busy
wharves of Boston, and it fills New Hampshire with deserted
farms. For some mysterious reasons which it will never dis--
close, it carries wealth and importance past one threshold that
it may lay them down at another. The old channels of commerce
are broken up, and the points which depended upon them
are left to philosophize upon the mutability of human affairs in
forgotten obscurity. Meanwhile San Francisco and Chicago
spring up like a very palace of Aladdin, and the centre of
population is transferred, as if by magic, to some point which
existed in the school-books of the present generation of men
only as a howling wilderness. Meanwhile prices seek a level;
produce is exchanged; labor goes where it is needed. England
and Russia exchange bread for cotton, and Iowa and Ireland,
labor for corn. These countries are nearer to one another
now than in 1829 were the very counties of England. Increased
activity demands new centres and channels, and those
phenomena result which men call railroad centres, the apparition
of which on the face of the earth is confounding and puzzling
all thinking men. At the time of the great plague, just
before the fire of 1666, De Foe estimated the population of
London at one million souls; but Macaulay places it, more
accurately, for about the same time, at 500,000. In the
succeeding century and a half it increased about threefold,
until, in 1831, it numbered 1,600,000. The new era then
commenced, and from that time the growth of London was
almost to be dated. During the next twenty years its population
had risen to 2,500,000; and to-day it contains within
its limits hardly less than 4,000,000 of human beings. Between
1666 and 1821 it had a growth of three hundred %, and it has experienced nearly similar increase between
1821 and 1871. When Fulton steamed up the Hudson, Paris
was a city of rather more than half a million of inhabitants,
and it now numbers about 2,000,000. In the days of Louis
XIV. it had 490,000, and in 1841, 912,000, --- an increase
of one hundred % in two centuries. In 1866 it had
1,825,000, --- an increase of one hundred % in twentyfive
years.

The results in America have been no less extraordinary.
In 1807 New York numbered a population of about 75,000.
Chicago existed in 1829 only as an uninviting swamp inhabited
by a dozen families, and San Francisco was hardly a
name. In 1830 New York contained over 200,000 inhabitants;
and to-day they exceed 900,000, without considering
those suburbs which enter so largely into the bulk of London
and Paris. Between 1829 and 1870 Chicago had increased to
300,000, and San Francisco since 1847 has become a city of
150,000 inhabitants.

Nearly twenty years ago Macaulay called attention to the
fearful human material of which this growth was composed.
He then referred to the arguments used by Gibbon and Adam
Smith to prove that the world would not again be flooded with
barbarism; and he remarked that it had not occurred to those
philosophers "that civilization itself might engender the barbarians
who should destroy it. It had not occurred to them
that in the very heart of great capitals, in the neighborhood
of splendid palaces and churches and theatres and libraries
and museums, vice and ignorance might produce a race of
Huns fiercer than those who marched under Attila, and of
Vandals more bent on destruction than those who followed
Genseric." When Macaulay used these words in Edinburgh
in 1852, he could hardly have realized that the growth of
those great cities was but just begun; but since that time
London has increased fifty %, and the "Vandals" of Paris
have recently given a point to his well-balanced period which
it never had before. For America, and the permanence of
republican institutions, this tendency of population to concentrate
at great railroad centres, cannot fail to be a subject for
anxious consideration. The success of popular government
must depend solely upon the virtue, the intelligence, and the
public spirit of the people governed. As long as the members
of any community can be approached by reason, or by argument,
or by considerations of the public good, there is no sound
cause to despair of the safety of any republic. It is useless,
however, to hope or to struggle for that safety for any length
of time after one party has firmly established its power upon
the basis of an ignorant, unapproachable proletariat. The
tendency of all self-governed great cities is inevitably towards
this political control through the agency of irresponsible masses.
The history of Athens and of Rome is continually repeating itself,
and never has its reproduction displayed features more
closely resembling the great originals than now in the leading
municipalities of America. In what respect, except in
name, does the city of New York enjoy a republican form of
government? Yet the difference between New York and the
other great cities of the continent is simply one of degree.
The same tendencies, which must inevitably lead to the same
results, are manifest everywhere. The dense aggregation of
mankind may be said to necessarily result in an upper class
which wants to be governed, and in a lower class which has
to be governed. The extreme of luxury and the extreme of
misery are equally fatal to public virtues; and no one can
doubt that the great cities of the future are destined infinitely
to surpass, both as regards luxury and misery, anything of the
kind which the world has yet seen. This must result from
the mere progress of railroad development. It is no less certain
that republican America is destined very shortly to be
dotted all over with these centres of population. Created by
railroads, the railroads lend to them a gravitating influence
both moral and political which cannot be ignored. To hope
for a pure government by the people at large while ignorance
and corruption are the ruling forces in these centres, is as
futile as it would be to look for healthy members where the
vitals are diseased. This it is which really constitutes that
problem of great cities which so confounds the friends of popular
government.

Meanwhile the influence of this railroad power upon the
politics of America and the political theories at the base of
party organizations has been very strongly defined and little
considered. Paradoxical as it sounds, it has actually made
that which was mistaken, right, and that which was dangerous,
safe. The year 1830 was a year of political revolution
in America, --- the friends of a strong central government went
out of power, and a party hostile in theory to all concentration
of governmental functions came in. It can now hardly admit
of a doubt that both parties to that bitter and memorable
struggle were right, and it is equally true that both were
wrong. Both, however, were made right or wrong by one
element which entered into the practical solution of the questions
agitated with decisive consequences, --- an element wholly
unanticipated by either side, --- the element of improved locomotion.
It may now with safety be premised that a strong
central government was a political necessity for the United
States of a time anterior to 1830; that in this respect Hamilton
was right and Jefferson was wrong. It may also, with
equal safety, be asserted that a strong central government constitutes
a continually increasing political danger for the United
States of the period subsequent to 1830; that the school of
Hamilton is wrong, and the school of Jefferson is right. An
equally thoughtful and observant man would thus have been
a Hamiltonian up to 1830, and a Jeffersonian subsequently
to that date. During the first period he would have seen
a country of vast dimensions and sparsely settled, without
means of communication or diversified industries, full of local
jealousies and destitute of any recognized centre of thought or
business, --- a country, in short, in constant danger of going to
pieces from lack of cohesion, --- a country in which the centrifugal
force continually tended to overpower the centripetal.
Then the railroad system sprang into being, and all this rapidly
changed, --- science suddenly supplied that cohesion which
it had been the great study of the statesman to provide. The
point from which danger was to be anticipated thus gradually
passed to the other side of the circle, --- everything centralized
of itself, --- all things gravitated: the unaided centripetal
force was clearly overcoming the centrifugal. Thus the error
of yesterday had become the truth of to-day, and the only
men who were hopelessly wrong were the thoroughly consistent.
The world at large rarely allows for these changes of
conditions; a statesman or a political party must stand or fall
with the permanence of that policy with which they have
identified themselves, and posterity rarely stops to consider
how circumstances have altered cases. Yet it is none the
less true that the inventions of Robert Fulton and George
Stephenson settled, in the minds of all thinking men, those
great questions of internal policy for the United States government
which were so fiercely contested in the first cabinet
of Washington; and the way in which they settled
them was by altering every condition of the problem. The
destinies of nations are, perhaps, very much more frequently
decided in the workshops of mechanics than in the councils of
princes.

The influence of this same power has, however, made itself
felt by the people of the United States in their political capacity
more recently and in another way, though the sequel
of this last experience is yet to be developed. The war of the
rebellion left the United States heavily burdened with debt,
upon which a high rate of interest had to be paid, while its
people were at once infected with a mania for speculation and
debauched by an irredeemable paper currency. A system of
taxation was in use calculated to excite in equal degrees the
wonder and contempt of all future students of fiscal problems.
Under these circumstances the shrewdest men of business were
always predicting an immediate and wide-spread commercial
catastrophe, and the more cunning politicians hastened to conciliate
the spirit of repudiation, which they asserted was sure
to rise up. History furnished no precedent which would lead
any political economist to suppose that a currency once greatly
debased would ever appreciate through a regular and healthy
process; and the statesman could not but see with alarm evidences
of indebtedness passing out of the country into foreign
hands by the hundreds of millions. It is not too much to say
that the financial history of the six years between 1865 and
1871 falsified every prediction ever made as regards it. No
wide-spread commercial crisis, no general collapse of private
credit took place in America, nor did that one which swept
over England cross the Atlantic; the public debt was steadily
decreased, and the interest upon it was cheerfully paid; the
spirit of repudiation ruined in its early death the hopes of
numerous political charlatans; the currency rapidly appreciated
to its gold value, while the mass of indebtedness against
the country held in foreign hands constantly increased, and
showed no signs of a return for redemption.

The simple truth was that, through its energetic railroad
development, the country then was producing real wealth as
no country ever produced it before. Behind all the artificial
inflation, which, if the experience of the past was worth anything,
so clearly foreshadowed a catastrophe, there was also
going on a production which exceeded all experience. This
new element vitiated the best reasoned conclusions. The railroad
system, acting upon undeveloped and inexhaustible natural
resources, dragged the country through its difficulties in
spite of itself,--- it actually seemed as though fraud, ignorance,
and speculation combined were unable to precipitate disaster.
While all of these agents were noisily at work, every mile
of railroad constructed was quietly adding many times its cost
to the aggregate wealth of the country, --- the tonnage carried
over the new roads built each year was many hundreds of millions
in value, while that of the old roads always increased, so
that the estimated average of annual transportation, which
was but $85 for each inhabitant of the country in 1860, had,
in 1870, risen to $300.

Such an increase in actual production could alone account
for the general setting aside of all the lessons of the past.
Not the least instructive part of this experience was, perhaps,
the complacency with which a certain class of philosophers
mistook the operation of a great, quiet, natural force for the
results of their own meddling. One school attributed the
freedom from commercial disaster to the juggle of paper
money. Another saw in the great prosperity of the day
nothing but a vindication of the absurdities of protection.
While sciolists talked, however, the locomotive was at work,
and all the obstructions which they placed in its way could at
most only check but never overcome the impetus it had given
to material progress.

The same direct influences could unquestionably be traced
into morals, which have been observed in other departments
of life. The laws of combination and gravitation apply to
ethics no less than trade. Here, however, it is far more
difficult than elsewhere to strike the balance of profit and
loss. Whether the world, as a whole, is better or worse
than it was forty years ago is a point upon which the statistician
can as yet throw little light, and concerning which the
divergence of opinion between the old and the young is apt to
be excessive. One thing is very clear, the golden age of purity
and simplicity has always lain behind us ever since those early
times when it was first created in the imagination of the earliest
poets. We never realize how bad the old times were, until
we come to grope amid the happily forgotten records of their
filthy vices.

Such is a passing sketch of some of the disturbing influences
of the new power on the general aspect of the century,
--- influences so all-pervading in their results as to be rather
revolutionizing than disturbing. Whatever affects the whole
affects every part. It would therefore be mere waste of time
to follow out with curious assiduity the myriad remoter ramifications,
until, among larger incidents of change, we should
find the possibilities of emigration modifying for a time the
terrible truth of the Malthusian theory of population, and the
exodus of the nations going quietly on before our eyes upon a
scale which reduces to insignificance the largest of those
human tides the flow of which is traced through the pages of
Gibbon; or we might see the Highlander expelled from the
mountain fastnesses of his clan, because the railroad has made
them so accessible as a pleasure-ground to the English nobleman,
and a writer like John Stuart Mill forced to declare that
so wonderful are the changes, both moral and economical,
taking place in our age, that, without perpetually rewriting a
work like his "Elements of Political Economy," it is impossible
to keep up with them. Such would be the instances
among nations and authors, and, descending, we should see
the increased demand for a cheap press influencing the price
of rags in a country village, and the increased use of lubricating
oil compensating to the fisheries for the innovation
of gas. All of these, too, are the revolutions worked in a
single half-century by a force which is as yet bound up in its
swaddling-clothes. Its iron arms have been stretched out in
every direction; nothing has escaped their reach, and the most
firmly established institutions of man have proved under their
touch as plastic as clay. Everything is changing, and will
change with increasing rapidity. No human power can stop
it. It is useless to cast back regretful glances at the old quiet
days of other years and another order of things,--- at the
middle ages antecedent to 1807. The progressive may exult,
and the conservative may repine, but the result will be all the
same. We must follow out the era on which we have entered
to its logical and ultimate conclusions, for it is useless for men
to stand in the way of steam-engines. Change is usually ugly,
and the whole world, both physical and moral, is now in a
period of transition. But the serpent does not cast his skin
till the new one is formed beneath the old; and because the
old world is now sloughing its skin, we cannot conclude that
the world of the future is to exist without one.

>To-day I saw the dragon-fly
>Come from the wells where he did lie.
>
>An inner impulse rent the veil
>Of his old husk; from head to tail
>Came out clear plates of sapphire-mail.
>
>He dried his wings; like gauze they grew;
>Through crofts and pastures wet with dew,
>A living flash of light he flew.

It would be simply presumptuous to try to cast the horoscope
of this revolution after thus surveying the changes
already wrought. If we wished to draw a few feeble inferences
to reassure ourselves in regard to the future, we could
best do so b falling back on the analogies of the past.
The changes of the future will undoubtedly be more rapid,
more complete and more bewildering than those of the past,
in the same ratio that the combined forces now at work are
engines more powerful for change than the comparatively simple
ones of the earlier days. Still, the past cannot but throw
some light on the future. To the dwellers in it, the world
doubtless seemed sufficiently lovely before the middle of the
fifteenth century; but then the sloughing-time came on, and
the old skin was slowly shed, and, in the ripeness of time, the
new was found better. The old passed away amid the fierce
contortions of tortured communities, --- through wars and revolutions
and inquisitions and anarchy. The period of change
was ugly, and mankind often had cause for discouragement;
but the worst times were found bearable, and the result has
justified the price. Our era has just begun to work its own
revolution. That its results will all be pleasant, we may not
hope; that its course will be marked by fierce agonies, we have
been fully taught by the events of the last few years; but that
it will in the end serve to elevate and make more happy the
whole race of man upon earth, we have some cause to trust.
Yet in surveying the history of the last great era just finished,
--- the distinctive era of the printing-press, with all its changes
from 1444 to 1807,--- the imagination is bewildered and lost
in the vain effort to realize those more striking changes which
are to make remarkable the new era upon which we have just
entered, -the distinctive era of steam locomotion.

## The Transportation Tax

If by Free Trade is meant the unrestricted exchange of
the products of their industry among the peoples of the
earth, George Stephenson more than any other man deserves
to be called the great practical Free Trader. His invention
went very far towards abolishing the one sure basis of the
whole protective system, --- the one tax for which not Adam
Smith nor Cobden, neither abstract reason nor corn-law leagues,
could suggest any measure of repeal. Stephenson took off
from the world at large four fifths of the transportation tax.
During the last quarter of a century it may be said that the
whole efforts of the protectionist school have been concentrated
upon the attempt to replace, in the form of an arbitrary impost,
a portion of that burden which the improved facilities of transportation
had removed from human industry. Meanwhile apt
illustrations are not far to seek of the part which the railroad
system has borne in the great work of bringing the price of
things in their place of consumption as near as possible to their
price in that of production. Perhaps as striking an example
of this as could be found is presented in the case of the leading
material interest of the American people,--- the productions
of agriculture, and more especially corn and wheat.
Formerly, upon the old highways, it cost as much to carry a
bushel of corn 125 miles, or a bushel of wheat 250 miles, as
either of these articles was worth. The railroad has increased
this distance of possible carriage twentyfold. In other words,
it now costs less to carry a given quantity of corn or wheat
from Boston to San Francisco by rail, than forty years ago it
would have cost to carry the same quantity by the highway
from Boston to Albany. Where, therefore, formerly a given
centre could, as regards these cereals, hold tributary to it,
through land carriage and before all value was exhausted,
only some 50,000 square miles, or a region of about the
area of New York, it can now hold, at the same cost, over
8,000,000 square miles, or more than twice the area of the
whole United States.

Taking this given point as a centre, therefore, it follows that
a slight fractional increase or decrease in the transportation
tax must add to it or strike from it thousands of square miles
of tributary area. For instance, Chicago is the great produce
market of the country, and New York is its commercial centre.
The distance from one point to the other is a thousand miles.
In these days of fierce competition, five cents a bushel is no
small fluctuation --- loss or gain --- for the dealers in corn and
wheat. As a part of the transportation tax between Chicago
and New York this important variation of five cents a bushel
represents the merest trifle more than one mill and one half
per ton per mile. To the producers of a very large portion
of the interior of the continent, therefore, a matter of two
mills a ton per mile in freights must necessarily involve the
whole difference between a profit and a loss on their annual
industry.

Exception may perhaps be taken to the use of the odious
word "tax," in connection with the charge imposed for carriage
by rail. It may be said that this is a tax in no other sense
than a charge for any other necessary service rendered is a
tax. Usage and long-established authority have, indeed, fixed
upon this word a meaning which is too exclusively political, ---
as though some form of government could alone, and solely
for its own purposes, impose a pecuniary burden under the
name upon the wealth of a community. Such a definition is
open to serious objections. It not only creates a mischievous
confusion of ideas, but it actually deceives the community as
to the extent and unnecessary nature of many of the burdens
under which it labors. The burden of taxation, as it is called,
is crudely measured by the proportion which the public revenue
bears to the numbers or supposed wealth of any community
as expressed in the census. Such a measure is fallacious
in the extreme. A tax is not only a contribution taken directly
from the resources of any community for governmental or
public uses, but, in its general significance, it is also any burden,
natural or artificial, which, without altering the intrinsic
value, the quality, or the quantity of raw material, adds to its
cost before it reaches the consumer.

It is an elementary principle of political economy, that all
wealth comes from the soil; neither human industry nor human
ingenuity can produce any addition to the material possessions
of mankind, except from the earth. Everything produced
from the earth, moreover, is valuable only in so far as
some one wants it and is willing to exchange labor or its products
for it. Speaking somewhat loosely, all mankind may,
then, be divided into the two great classes of consumers and
producers, --- to the first of which every human being, and to
the last of which the vast majority of mankind, belongs. Between
the producer of the raw material and the consumer there
comes an intermediate class, the possessors of skilled labor, those
who by their industry lend an additional intrinsic value to the
raw material. Such are all manufacturers. The sum total,
therefore, of the wealth of any community and of the whole
world consists of all that which it has extorted from the earth,
enriched by any factitious value which may have been added to
it. These two elements of cost --- production and manufacture
--- are necessary preliminaries to a fitness for consumption :
everything beyond these which adds to the price of a commodity
before it reaches the consumer is a tax levied upon consumption
or production; just as much a tax, if the increase is
charged for transportation and collected by an importer over
his counter, as if it is charged for revenue and received by a
collector at the custom-house. If tea, for instance, is raised
and cured in China, and thence transported thousands of miles
to London, and the consumer in London pays three times the
price at which it was sold by him who cured it in China, that
additional sum, however fairly earned by the services rendered,
is nothing more nor less than a tax of two hundred %
on the consumption of tea in London, which again reacts and
affects the profit on its production in China. It is a necessary
tax, perhaps, in view of existing means of transportation, but
none the less is it a tax. The process of removal from one
point to another --- from the point of production to that of
consumption --- has added nothing to the wealth of the world.
It has, indeed, distributed, but it has in no way increased or
intrinsically qualified human possessions; for after it, as before,
whether in Canton or in London, the world possessed the same
number of pounds of tea of a given quality. So of flour, of
cotton, and of every other product of the soil. Transportation
is simply a distribution of wealth in existence; and the cost
of distribution constitutes a tax on consumption, levied indifferently
on the producer, the manufacturer, and the consumer.
This tax must necessarily fall upon all parties, though
in unequal proportions very difficult to ascertain. Could it be
wholly abolished, and breadstuffs be transported without cost
to London, the exchangeable value of flour would rise in Chicago
and fall in Liverpool. Society would then at once be relieved
of a tax in comparison with which all the imposts of governments
are trivial. In like manner, anything which adds to the
necessary cost of transportation aggravates the tax, and anything
which diminishes it removes one more burden from
human toil.

These facts and principles must be clearly borne in mind,
else the great interest which communities have in all questions
of transportation cannot be appreciated. The preliminary
discussion may be fairly summed up as follows. All elements
of price which add to the amount paid by the consumer of any
commodity above the cost of the production and manufacture
are in the nature of direct taxes on consumption and of indirect
taxes on production, --- whether imposed by government, by
distance, or the friction of trade, --- everywhere and always a
tax.

The transportation tax, however, has one peculiarity in common
with the tariff tax upon imports; the lower it is fixed,
within certain limits, the larger in the aggregate it becomes.
Large aggregate receipts of railroad corporations, or large _per
capita_ payments to their railroads by communities by no means
necessarily indicate an oppressive scale of railroad charges, but,
not improbably, the contrary. Industry pays a large tax because
the tax is levied in such a way that industry is stimulated,
and carries its burdens easily. With municipal taxes,
except those raised from tariff imposts, the case is wholly different.
Every increase there indicates a direct addition to a
burden, --- the larger its aggregate the heavier is the load imposed
by it upon the production of the State; in the case of
the transportation tax, on the contrary, the larger the total
becomes the greater is the volume of business indicated, and,
very probably, the lower the tariff rates.

It is computed that the yearly revenue of the 53,000 miles
of railroad now in operation in the United States is in the
neighborhood of $450,000,000, and represents an annual
average payment of nearly $12 per head from the whole population
of the country. The rapid growth of this payment
has been extraordinary, and well illustrates the importance of
the limitation last referred to. In 1840, when there were less
than 3,000 miles of railroad in the country, the annual payment
hardly exceeded $8,000,000 or fifty cents each to the
inhabitants of the country. Even in 1860 it scarcely equalled
$150,000,000 or less than five dollars per head. These sums
measure the growth of the internal commerce of the country.
Should a new invention come into use which should prove as
great an improvement upon steam locomotion as that is on
the system which preceded it, the aggregate transportation tax
would not improbably be increased several fold, and amount,
perhaps, to fifty dollars a year for each inhabitant, and yet,
upon the tonnage now moved, the yearly expenditure would
be decreased from $450,000,000 to $45,000,000. The large
amount of the levy affords in itself no just ground for complaint.

The next question is, For what purpose is this tax levied,
and to whom does it accrue? What portion of this large sum
is a necessary tax upon the community; and what portion, if
any, is unnecessary? Railroads must not only be built, but
they must be operated. The gross income of the system must
therefore be devoted to two ends: first, to the operating of
the roads; and, secondly, to the remuneration of the capital
invested in them. The tables of statistics show, that, under
the present system of operating American railroads, which
must be presumed to be reasonably economical, seventy % of the gross earnings are consumed in operating expenses.
This is approximately the absolute cost of working and replacing
the machinery which keeps up the movement of commerce.
It is the necessary tax, the first cost, as it were, of
friction. The remaining thirty % of the $450,000,000
of gross revenue --- perhaps $150,000,000 per annum --- is the
amount reserved as a remuneration for the capital and the risk
involved in the construction and management of the system.
This sum is, therefore, an annual tax by itself, which the people
of this country pay to those who own and control our railroads.
In view of the inestimable value, both immediate and
prospective, of the service rendered, and of the essential part
it plays in material and moral progress, it would indeed be
strange if this tax were very closely scrutinized, or were not
cheerfully, and even eagerly, paid. Yet every tax upon their
resources should be calmly and carefully scanned by a people
which pretends to guide its own destinies. In spite, however,
of its enormous proportions and onerous nature, in spite of
the fact that it adds to the cost of every article of consumption
and enters into the expense of every movement of national
and individual life, this transportation tax is so indirect in
its nature, so plausible and fair in its reason, and is so completely
a part of the customary life of the community, that,
until within a very few years past, it has excited absolutely
far less real attention and less earnest discussion than a tax
of a dollar a gallon on whiskey, or two cents a pound on cotton.
Indeed, it has not as yet even excited enough attention
to cause the several State governments to procure returns and
statistics about it. Its very amount must be guessed at from
such partial data as the corporations themselves see fit to furnish.

Two thirds of this annual tax of $450,000,000 may then be
regarded as made in payment of actual work of transportation,
and the remaining one third represents what is, in the opinion
of the owners of the roads, a fair compensation, or at any rate
the best that can be got, for the use of the capital and the risk
involved in the business. In other words, certain private individuals,
responsible to no authority and subject to no supervision,
but looking solely to their own interests or to those of
their immediate constituency, yearly levy upon the internal
movement of the American people a tax, as a suitable remuneration
for the use of their private capital, equal to about one
half of the expenses of the United States government, --- army,
navy, civil-list, and interest upon the national debt included.
Whether this sum is in the aggregate an excessive remuneration
or not is immaterial. Probably, as will hereafter be seen,
it is not. This consideration only partially meets the real
vital point at issue. The question of the manner in which the
amount is raised is even more important than the amount itself.
For it may well be that a tax, not in itself excessive,
may be raised in an annoying and vexatious manner; or so as
to oppress one locality, at the expense of another; or it may
be exacted in payments which fluctuate wildly at different
times, destroying all basis of sound business calculation; or it
may be regulated so as to exact the greatest compensation possible
for the least possible service; or, finally, it may be calculated
to produce a fixed and reasonable profit, and to discourage
all business development in excess of that easily able
to pay such profit. All of these are matters not of mere
study, --- they are not suggestions of that which is improbable,
--- but they are points of serious public concern. They
are all involved in the question of the manner in which the
transportation tax is raised, as contradistinguished from its
amount.

The obvious danger of committing so extraordinary a power
as that described to private individuals, could not well have
escaped the attention of legislators even in the earliest days
of the system. But when the process of railroad construction
began, forty years ago, those who were called upon to inaugurate
it little foresaw the proportions which it was soon to
assume. They, however, took every precaution against abuse
which suggested itself, and the world has since done little more
than follow in the path marked out, and elaborate and work
over the various measures then devised.

This, however, took place the lifetime of a generation back.
The practical working of the various theories on which the
system was inaugurated has of late years been anxiously discussed,
and the question of how the community can best regulate
and keep within bounds the cost of its transportation is
assuming a new significance. The time also has now come
when the operation of the various laws, whether natural or
human, --- whether laws of trade or acts of legislature, --- which
were relied upon to secure a healthy and economical railroad
development can be passed in review and a judgment be calmly
formed upon them.

Sir Robert Peel and King Leopold of Belgium were probably
the two men of those days whose minds exercised the most
immediate and lasting influence upon this question. They
both approached it, however, in the manner characteristic of
their education, habits of thought, and the political and social
surroundings in which they were placed. Peel was essentially
a parliamentarian; King Leopold was the model head of a
bureaucratic government. The former instinctively turned
for protection to the operation of natural laws, such as competition
or the laws of supply and demand, supplemented, if
need be, by any desired amount of acts of Parliament; the
latter took counsel with the economists and administrators,
and shaped a policy under which the community was intended
to cut itself loose from the capitalist, and to undertake the
management of its own channels of communication in its own
interests. The systems inaugurated respectively in England
and Belgium under the impulse of these two minds have since
spread over the whole civilized world. The several nations
have modified them in greater or less degree to meet local
conditions or habits of thought or action; but, in great essentials,
the two groups all the world over clearly exhibit
their distinctive characteristics.

The English system, which is that also in use in America,
rests wholly upon the fundamental principle of the private
ownership of railroads by corporations. By these corporations
the roads are to be constructed, and they recoup themselves
for the risk and expenditure involved by levying a toll for
the transportation of merchandise or passengers. Two agencies
were relied upon to prevent the owners of the railroads from
abusing the power confided in them; the one was competition,
the other was statute regulation. It was argued, and still is
argued, that if railroads were left wholly alone, if all parties
were free to construct them wherever a demand for them was
thought to exist, if these parties were free to make what they
could on them, that, in this case, wherever the profits of the
capital employed were excessive new capital would flow in and
new roads would be constructed until here, as in all other departments
of trade, profits and charges would equalize themselves.
This was Peel's early argument; it did not last long
with him.

It was many years, however, after the railroad system was
inaugurated, before any, except the most clear-sighted, could
be made to realize that railroads were monopolies, and must be
treated as such, not only in their own interest, but in that of
the community. King Leopold, saw it as early as 1834.
George Stephenson saw it from the beginning, and condensed
the whole question into the pithy apophthegm, that "where
combination was possible, competition was impossible." Again
in 1846, before a committee of the House of Commons, he gave
it as his decided opinion that the power of government supervision
should extend to vetoing the construction of competing
lines, to protect the public against the heavy rates of
traffic which would be required to remunerate the capital involved
in their construction. Stephenson fully appreciated
what the ultimate burden of free trade in railway construction
would amount to. He saw that a line once built must
impose a tax on the community, if only to keep itself in
existence. He also saw, that, if a competing road was built
to divide any given business which could by any possibility
be done over a road already constructed, in the end that
business must support two roads instead of one. A very
slender knowledge of human nature would have enabled him
to take the next step, and conclude that any number of
competing roads would ultimately unite to exact money
from the community, rather than continue a ruinous competition.
As combination must always remain possible, no
matter how many roads are constructed, it necessarily follows
that the more roads the heavier tax, provided always
a less number properly managed could have been made to
do the work. Relief did not lie in that direction; it could be
found there only under circumstances which rendered exclusive
combination impossible. Nor is human legislation to be included
in the number of such circumstances. Had Stephenson
lived a few years longer, he would have seen in England an
excellent example of the virtues of railroad competition guaranteed
by law, as a safeguard to the community, --- an example
not without a savor of comfort for America, with the memory
of recent legislative experiences fresh in mind. The Great
Northern Railway went before Parliament for its charter. The
lines threatened with competition combined their influence,
and the bill was thrown out. The next year the application
was renewed, and those having the bill in charge engineered
it successfully through Parliament by offering to accede to a
charter limitation of first-class fares to a point thirty %
below those charged by the existing companies. The bill was
passed and the line constructed, so that a combination, except
at low fares, seemed prohibited by act of Parliament. Before
the new road was opened, however, before a passenger had
passed over it, its directors, pointing out to the other companies
how much they would suffer from such ruinous competition,
induced them to combine the Parliamentary strength of
all concerned, and they actually got through Parliament an
amendatory bill, raising the fares of the new road to the level
of the old. The law of self-preservation had simply been repealed
by act of Parliament.

How much this fallacy of cheap transportation through railroad
competition has cost Great Britain cannot well be estimated.
During the mania of 1845 -46, it was estimated by
Mr. Laing, of the Board of Trade, and the estimate was confirmed
by Robert Stephenson, that out of three hundred millions
sterling, at that time expended, seventy millions had been
completely thrown away in constructing unnecessary duplicate
lines with a view to competition.

The result of this dependence upon a correct general principle,
misapplied, has, in America, been both singular and
interesting; and, indeed, it is a question whether competition
has done more harm or good to the business community which
has relied upon it as a protection in this case against monopoly.
No system can work its way out to logical results which
is perpetually subject to fluctuations; and competition has
ever acted on the railway system as a violent disturbing element.
At one time it has forced down the charges on transportation
to an unnaturally low rate, only to elevate them at
another time by artificial combinations to a rate as unnecessarily
excessive. During the year 1869 freights between New
York and Chicago fluctuated under this influence, between
$5 and $37.60 per ton; and between the same point and St.
Louis, between $7 and $46; while, the Erie Railway carried
goods to Chicago at as low a rate as $2 per ton, and from
this bounded back to $37. In the last case, part of the transportation
was by water; but rates on the same class of freights
carried through by rail have ranged all the way from four mills
to four cents per ton per mile, and fluctuated violently from
the one point to the other. Such has been the result of competition
as regards through business, while upon local business
its effect has been even more pernicious. "Usually, competing
lines, while they seek the same large centres of commerce, reach
them through different districts. This confines their competition
to the trade of such centres, while the traffic of the country
peculiar to each line is not only uncompeted for, but subjected
to an extra and often oppressive tax, whereby to restore
the revenue depletions each road suffers in its violent struggles
with the others for jointly accessible business. The ability to
unjustly burden uncompetitive or local trade supplies transporters
with strength to wage prolonged contests for other
tonnage at less than cost of transport; and this wretched
warfare, indirectly ruinous to the local business it overtaxes,
is of little real benefit to the property battled for; as, sooner
or later, truce is declared, and, if the truce becomes a permanent
peace, competition ceases; while if but a temporary
measure, it is presently broken, but only to be renewed; then
renewed, but only to be broken; while the tax on trade fluctuates
with the shattering or maintenance of covenants, until
commerce is harassed and dazed and partially prostrated by
its wild, illogical, and ruinous changes.[^/366]

For these reasons competition has long been regarded among
the best authorities on railroads as a dangerous evil. The
most sagacious look upon it as a terrible weapon in the hands
of the visionary, the reckless, or the ignorant; an almost insuperable
obstacle in the way of the judicious, the conservative,
and the progressive. It disturbs every calculation,
vititates every result, puts a stop to all experiment, destroys
all system. All persons concerned in the management of railways
are therefore anxious to get rid of it, --- the more respectable,
that the railway system may have a chance to work out
its results under a settled policy; the unscrupulous and less
reputable, that a better occasion for levying plunder may be
afforded. Under these circumstances it is not impossible that
all may unite in the adoption of the principle now lying at the
basis of what are known as the "colored lines," --- that of a
combination and a clearing-house for the adjustment of difficulties,
as a solution of the question.


[^/366]: "Transportation as a Science." A paper read by Jos. D. Potts, President
of the Empire Transportation Co., before the American Social Science
Association at a meeting in New York, October 28, 1869.

Such a combination would, of course, at once put a stop to
competition in so far as the land carriage of freight is concerned.
And for this reason in many of the States legislation
has been directed against the consolidation of competing lines.
In 1869 an act forbidding it was passed in New York, and
more recently a provision to the same end has been incorporated
into the Constitutions of Illinois and of Michigan. It is
wholly unnecessary to say that all such measures of State
legislation are utterly futile, almost childish. These giants
have sometime since outgrown State swaddling-clothes. Even
had they not, the character of such legislation is most open to
criticism. Certainty and responsibility in management are
two of the most important requisites of a good railroad
system. This is peculiarly the case in America, where almost
our only machinery for the correction of abuses lies in the
degree of concentration with which public opinion can be
brought to bear in a given direction. If our people distinctly
feel an evil and can be made to see that some one is responsible
for it, there is no interest nor combination of interests which
can long resist the pressure. So far as railroads are concerned,
competition puts both certainty and responsibility out of the
question; it renders the first impossible, and, by dividing,
destroys the last. Most conclusive illustrations of all these
propositions, as well as of the utter insufficiency of State legislation
to deal with the subject, may be found in the experience
of the year 1870.

During that year competition was bitter in the extreme;
the rates made East and West were simply ruinous. On
certain descriptions of freight they literally were reduced to
nothing, and cattle were carried over the Erie road at a cent
a head, as against one dollar a car, the rate charged on the
Central. On other articles the reduction was not so great,
but, both on passengers and goods, rates were purely nominal,
and hardly averaged a third of the usual amounts. Of course
this could not last. Early in September, 1870, representatives
of the competing lines met in New York, and proceeded to
put a stop to competition in the one way possible among monopolists,
--- by combination. The parties in interest were the
Central, the Erie, and the Pennsylvania Railroads. The competition
was mainly from Illinois to New York. In both
Illinois and New York laws forbidding the consolidation of
competing lines were in force, and all the roads were carrying
on operations in one or both of those States. At the meeting
in question it was decided to "pool" the earnings of the
colored lines to all competing points; in other words, all receipts
from that business which was supposed to receive a
peculiar benefit from competition, were to be paid into a common
fund, competition was immediately to cease, fixed rates were
to be charged, and thus, at last, all the great trunk lines were
to be practically consolidated, in so far as the business community
was concerned. This arrangement was agreed to, but
broke down for the moment because of quarrels among certain
of the individual contracting potentates. The irreconcilables
were Messrs. Gould and Vanderbilt, two New York men,
who represented two New York roads; and yet the New York
statute-book contained a recently enacted law intended to
prevent and render impracticable any combination like the one
agreed upon. Not being able to effect the desired arrangement
there, certain of the same parties went to Chicago, in a
State where a similar provision to that in force in New York
had been made a part of the Constitution, and there they actually
did enter into an agreement, under which all the
roads between Chicago and Omaha "pooled" their receipts
between those points, and this contract went into effect. Yet
no law, no constitutional restriction, was violated. No law, in
fact, could be framed which would meet the case, and the
solemn efforts to accomplish it were simply illustrative of the
extreme ignorance prevailing among fairly intelligent men as
to the practical limits of legislation.

The failure of the New York negotiators was, however, only
temporary; and, moreover, it is by no means clear that its
failure was not a disaster to the community. In this combination
would at least have been found some degree of certainty
and of responsibility. Rates would no longer have varied with
every season and to every city; points destitute of competition
would not have been plundered, as they now habitually
are, that competing points might be supplied for nothing.
During the summer of 1870, accordingly, many towns in New
England were charged upon Western freights heavily in advance
of the sums charged for carrying the same freights on
the same roads a hundred or two miles farther on. All because,
through competition, the farther point was served at a
loss to the carrier, and, therefore, the nearer had to pay the
road profits for both, besides replacing the loss. The agents
of the roads do not seek to deny this; they acknowledge and
defend it. They say, and say truly: "We must live. If our
through business is done at a loss (and they show that it was
done for nothing), then our local business must pay for all."
This was the case in New England. The cities of central New
York fared no better. During a war of rates, almost any
manufactured article will be carried from the seaboard to the
West for perhaps one half of the amount charged for carrying
the article there from a semi-interior point. So also as
regards Eastern freights. Syracuse, Rochester, and the like
class of cities can neither compete on equal terms with Boston
in the markets of the West, nor with Chicago in those of the
East. The discrimination against them is said to amount in
certain cases to ten % of the whole value of the article
transported. Neither, under the competing system, is there
any remedy for this evil, and a consciousness of this fact, of
the risk to which they are continually exposed, has caused the
breaking up of many manufacturing establishments at interior
points.

Again, the element of gambling is not considered as an advantageous
one in the transaction of business. To eliminate
it, to equalize, to insure stability and an even operation of
natural laws in trade, is one attribute of an advancing civilization
and a chief result of science. Does not a sudden change
in a tariff,--- a change sprung on the community in an hour,
ranging all the way from one hundred to fifteen thousand % on all classes of freights, --- infuse an element of chance
into current transactions? Just this fluctuation took place in
September, 1870. How, also, could the business community
deal with certainty, or make orders or contracts during that
year, when it at one time cost far more to send goods from
Boston to Chicago than from New York, and shortly after
New York firms had to ship their goods to Boston as the
cheapest way of getting them to the West. Thus competition
by rail, unlike that by sea, knew no law of supply and demand;
there was always a given supply of machinery, wholly
irrespective of the demands of trade. Here, then, was no
certainty, no stability; a great evil existed; yet who was to
be held responsible for it? Upon what point was public opinion
to be concentrated? It could not be on the system, for
nothing of the sort in an organized form exists; neither could
it be on individuals, for they clearly were unable to control
events, otherwise there would have been no recourse to "pool.
ing." The responsibility, in fact, was and is absolutely divided
away; it does not exist.

States and legislatures will doubtless for some little while
longer cling to the idea of competition as regulating tariffs by
rail, but it must break down in the end. The value of competition
as affecting the railroad system is very great, but it
lies in the superior quality of the service it exacts, --- the
promptness, comfort, civility, and general regard to the wishes
of the public. These things no statute can regulate, but
competition does; as regards rates on the other hand the
result of thirty years' reliance upon competition may se briefly
summed up by saying that nineteen places out of every twenty
on our railroads are wholly at the mercy of close monopolies,
while each twentieth point enjoys such advantages of the law
of supply and demand as may be evolved out of fierce competition,
alternating with close combination.

The school of Sir Robert Peel had, however, by no means
exclusively relied upon the operation of natural laws to regulate
the new system. They would not have been English
statesmen had they not had recourse to acts of Parliament to
make good any deficiencies in the law of supply and demand ;
and following, as is the custom in such cases, the precedents
already upon the statute-book, they undertook, in the complete
breakdown of competition, to apply the remedy against
extortion which most naturally suggested itself, that of affixing
a limit to profits.

This was accordingly done, and, following the example thus
set, in the earliest charters granted in this country are found
clauses reserving a power of abating charges for transportation
whenever the dividends of the companies shall exceed a certain
percentage on the capital. In England, Parliament further
attempted to limit the profits of these enterprises by including
in the charters long and carefully prepared lists of charges
which the companies could not exceed. Such an attempt,
made at that time, could of course only be very crude and
unsatisfactory. The system, however, expanded through long
years into a mass of legislation, half public, half private, based
on no principle and no knowledge, and finally culminating,
after the manner of the English, in a multiplicity of conflicting
acts, and a confusion worse confounded. For instance, by the
charter of the Lancaster & Carlisle Railway, passed in 1844,
and resembling, at great length, the old toll-boards of the
turnpikes, it was minutely set forth that a "horse, mule, or
ass" should not be charged at more than three pence per
mile, nor a calf or pig, "or other small animal," at more than
a penny; and so on through an interminable list, beginning
with "dung, compost, and all sorts of manure," and ending
with "passengers and animals." The charter of this road, by
the way, consisted of three hundred and eighty-one distinct
clauses; and the commission of 1867 reports, that, in addition
to the acts of universal application, "the powers of
the railway companies and the consequent rights of the public
are now scattered through three thousand one hundred acts of
Parliament," and are exceedingly difficult of ascertainment.

It further resulted that the tariffs of charges, being based
upon the old turnpike and canal experiences, were extremely
exorbitant, and the profits of the early lines were unduly large.
In other words, the tax levied on the community by the proprietors
of the lines in their own favor was evidently oppressive.
The attention of Parliament was called to the subject,
and in 1844, at the instance of Mr. Gladstone, a law was enacted
which contained a clause of general operation, practically,
in the view of railway directors, limiting their dividends
to ten % per annum upon the stock of their roads.
This particular feature of an otherwise well-considered act led
to results in no way anticipated. Not only did it go far towards
bringing on the railroad mania of 1845, which was
comparatively a small matter, but it introduced into England
the practice of what has since been known as stock-watering,
--- one of the most ingenious and oppressive forms of
burdening the growth and industry of a people and of mortgaging
future development which has ever been devised.
Immediately upon the enactment of this law the railway managers
resorted to the usual weapons of those who wish to tax
an unwilling community. The more direct and lighter tax
having raised a popular outcry, they acquiesced in what they
regarded as its repeal, and at once proceeded to levy several
times the sum previously levied, through a vastly more oppressive
form of indirect taxation. As they considered that
after the enactment of 1844 they could no longer, on their
existing stock, safely divide all the money they could earn, the
railroad financiers, on every possible pretext, create additional
shares, until the gross amount of the stock should be sufficient
to absorb, in the dividends allowed by the act, the utmost possible
net earnings of their roads. The Gladstone act, in so far
as it failed to place checks upon the creation of new stock,
was defective. Excessive charges and large profits had been
found to be like excessive direct taxation, --- a present burden,
which wrought its own cure, and that speedily; but an increase
of stock was nothing more nor less than a creation of new
national debt. It represented so much paper capital to pay
dividends and interest upon which a tax in the shape of transportation
charges was to be levied forever. In other words,
the increasing business of the community was mortgaged in
perpetuity to pay dividends on capital stock of railways upon
which not a penny had ever been paid in.

It is not worth while, however, to go into the details of the
history of stock-watering in England. There it has never been
reduced to a science, although Sir Morton Peto carried it to a
very creditable degree of perfection. In America only is the
process found in its highest stage of development. Here it
may be studied as an art now in its mature perfection, and as
such merits consideration by itself.

Neither would it be difficult in American railway history to
select examples of another no less unsatisfactory result of this
usury law. Roads could be named which have found themselves
inconveniently prosperous; so far from having any
incentive to increased energy they already, on the business
they conveniently did, earned more than it was quite safe for
them to confess to. Their profits seemed to invite legislative
interference. As a result, development stopped. Every proposal
of new enterprise was quietly but honestly met with
the argument that it was better to "leave well enough alone."
And for this result the corporations should not be held responsible.
They had fulfilled their contract, only, by the terms
of that contract, the community, at a certain point in their
development, not only deprived them of every incentive to
growth, but made growth absolutely dangerous to them.
Neither men nor corporations will labor, of their own free will,
that others may enjoy all the fruits of their labor; and, while
the sic vos non vobis principle is rigorously applied to railroad
enterprises, who can blame them if they practically reply to
all remonstrances and appeals with an indolent _cui bono_? Corporations,
like men, will labor unceasingly, and incessantly
develop under the impetus either of necessity or gain; but to
suppose, when absence of all competition deprives them of the
first impulse, and force of law destroys the second, that an abstract
love of the general prosperity will induce corporations,
any more than men, to do double or fourfold the labor necessarily
required to earn a given profit, requires an absence of common
sense not infrequently characteristic of the statute-book.

In spite of the ill success which attended all the earlier efforts
in that direction, the idea of regulating railroad charges
by act of legislature has continued to be a very favorite one in
the Anglo-Saxon mind. A deep-seated faith in "the omnipotence
of Parliament" is inherent in the English speaking race.
No act has, however, yet been framed which meets the case
proposed, and it is not easy to see how one could be framed.
The difficulty is very apparent. The railroad system of every
large community is made up of many different members.
These members exist and perform their duties to the community
under all sorts of varying conditions. One road is
built for passenger travel and another for freight, or even for
the transportation of a particular kind of freight, such as
iron or coal. There are roads to accommodate local travel
and others to accommodate through travel. Construction,
and consequently the cost of operation, vary just as much as
the configuration of the soil. We thus have a complicated
system, between the numerous members of which no connection
necessarily exists. The legislature is called upon to
frame a law, or a series of laws, which shall regulate the tariff
of charges throughout this system.

There are but two kinds of statute which any legislative
body can pass; --- there are statutes of general operation and
those of special operation. A law establishing a scale of fares
and freights of universal operation, which would affect one
road very slightly, would inevitably ruin another; and a law
which would meet the requirements of one half of the comA
simple general law being thus out of the question, the only
other resource has hitherto been to acts of special legislation.
These of course can be put in operation to any extent, as has
already been done in England, and probably with precisely
similar results. No large and constantly shifting legislative
body can, in the nature of things, be qualified to specifically
regulate the tariffs of numerous railroads.

Instinctively appreciating the great difficulties inherent in
this matter, and yet feeling a strong desire to do something
in the premises, many legislatures in America have taken refuge
in a sort of rude rule of thumb. They have sought to
fix upon all, or certain of the roads subject to their jurisdiction,
a hard indiscriminate tariff on travel or freight of so much
per mile. Such a solution of the difficulty may be popular,
but it is not intelligent. It ignores all special requirements;
all considerations of speed, comfort, distance, quantity or frequency
of movement. The operation of a simple clause
inserted in its charter, limiting the rates for travel upon the
New York Central Railroad, is always pointed out as conclusive
evidence of the wisdom of this class of legislation. The
Central is one railroad out of many in the State, however, and
two obvious criticisms may be made upon the operation of the
law even in this case. It wholly fails to provide for the universally
recognized principle that the burden of taxation should
be adjusted so as least to be felt. He who travels daily is no
more considered than he who travels once a year. No provision
whatever is made for that discount in price which should
always be allowed to the heavy purchaser. The most serious argument
that can however be adduced against this precedent is
that it discourages and defeats more searching but more complicated
efforts at reform. Confining itself to fares, it does not
even pretend to touch the intricate subject of freights. In
1851 the freight business and the passenger business were of
nearly equal value to the railroad system, returning for that
year about $20,000,000 each; but during the year 1868
the ratio of freight earnings to passenger earnings was as
$280,000,000 to $120,000,000, or as nearly two and a half
to one. The law in question, therefore, ignores that which
bears the great burden of the transportation tax. And yet
this is the best result of thirty years of consecutive effort
towards controlling the method of levying this tax by means
of legislative action;a short, simple rule, ignoring every
principle of railroad economy and two thirds of its business,
but limiting the charge for travel over a specified road to two
cents per mile.

Enough has perhaps been said of the practical working of
competition, supplemented by statute regulation, as a means
of controlling the mode of raising the transportation tax. It
is unnecessary to recapitulate. It is sufficient, in leaving this
branch of the subject, to say that, waiving all question of reasonableness
of amount, the levying of the $ 450,000,000 a year
which constitutes this tax would seem to be marked by many
of those characteristics which are considered most objectionable
in a government tax. The amount fluctuates wildly and
is very unequally imposed; the laws which seek to limit its
amount lead to fraud, evasion, and abuse, besides occasionally
even to the wilful sacrifice of those interests which they were
intended to protect.

It only remains in this connection to briefly describe the
results arrived at by the other method of controlling, in behalf
of the community, this subject of the transportation tax, the
method of ownership by the state as inaugurated by King
Leopold and Stephenson. This also has practically developed
into results which its originators could hardly have foreseen.
The magnitude of the task involved in supplying with railroads
a country even so densely populated and of so limited
extent as Belgium was evidently more than the government
had anticipated. Accordingly at a very early period it was
forced to devolve a large portion of the work upon private
enterprise. The result was a mixed system of ownership.
The government lines, managed by a bureau at the head of
which was a cabinet minister, ran side by side with private
lines owned and operated by companies as in England and
America. These were gradually consolidated until, in 1864, of
the 1247 miles of railroad in the country some 460 were either
absolutely owned or controlled under lease by the government,
and the remaining 780 miles, or little short of two thirds of
the whole, were in the hands of two private companies. The
result of this division of ownership was something wholly unanticipated.
It led to a new form of railroad competition,
which gave the government without recourse to legislation
a complete practical control over the railroad system as a
whole. The essential principle of this control was found, not
as in England and America in a multiplication of roads built
to compete but more frequently combining in private hands,
but in a regular and healthy competition through the mixed
ownership of roads already existing. Or, stated in another
way, the power of combination was destroyed by the introduction
into the system of an element which would not combine.
In 1866 the practical effect of this novel form of competition
was stated by the Belgian Minister at the head of the bureau
in these words, "the state railways thus find themselves
placed in constant comparison with the railways worked by
private companies; on the one hand stimulating them to general
improvements, and on the other hand acting as a sort of
check against any attempt to realize extravagant profits at the
cost of the public."

A sufficient illustration both of the method of practical
procedure and of the results arrived at under this system is
furnished by the record of the doings of the ten years between
1856--65.

In 1856, in spite of a considerable increase in the miles of
railroads worked, the freight movement of the Belgian roads
was found to have seriously decreased. Instead of making
good the deficiency in receipts by increased rates on existing
business, after the manner of private companies, the administration
met the emergency by accepting all traffic that
offered at greatly reduced special rates. This policy succeeded
so well that in 1861 the principle was adopted as regards minerals
and raw materials of a regular low scale of charges, with a
reduction according to distance. This resulted in the following
year in an increase of 72% in the tonnage of this
class of goods. In 1862 the principle was extended to goods
of the next class with similar results. In 1864, freights were
reclassified and the new principle applied to all except the first
class, or small parcels, which in this country are known as express
matter. The result was summed up by the Minister of
Public Works as follows: "In eight years, between 185664,
the charges on goods have been lowered, on an average,
by 28%; the public have sent 2,706,000 tons more
goods, while they have actually saved more than $4,000,000
on the cost of carriage, and the public treasury has earned an
increased net profit of $1,150,000." A further reduction,
made subsequently to this statement, in 1864, exceeded even
these results, and under it the tonnage rose from 4,479,000
tons in 1863, to 6,533,000 in 1864.

In 1865, the government, encouraged by these results,
turned its attention to fares, now applying to them principles
before applied to freights. A general scale was adopted, in
which the charge per mile was diminished in proportion to the
length of the journey over 22 miles. For distances less than
22 miles the old rates were retained, varying between 1.2 and
2.5 cents per mile, according to the class of carriage. Above
the 22 miles the rates rapidly decreased until the fares for distances
over 155 miles were as low as one cent per mile for first
class, and seven mills per mile for second class tickets. Under
this system the fare from Boston to Albany, for instance,
would be respectively $2, $1.40, and $1, according as it was
paid for a first, second, or third class ticket, instead of $6, as
at present. The effect of this change was a singular and very
striking illustration of the immediate influence of any reduction
of rates on the volume of travel. The traffic within distances
of 22 miles, on which no reduction was made, scarcely
increased at all. Between 22 and 46 miles, on which distances
the reduction was small, it increased only 20%,
while on distances over 46 miles, on which a heavy reduction
was made, it nearly doubled.

Here at last we see experiments carried on steadily to a legitimate
result by which principles are evolved. A free, untrammelled
competition between agents not limited in number
would be equally effective, but no such results have yet been
arrived at through the spasms of railroad competition. The
grand result, therefore, so far as Belgium is concerned, has
been all that could be desired. While the state roads have
boldly led the way, as in the case cited, in all the reforms
which have made the Belgium system famous, they have yet
&.ccomplished these great results without injury to the private
roads. These have followed the lead of the state roads only
as that lead was seen by its results to be safe, and they have
proved in consequence far more profitable investments to their
owners than the roads in England. As a result of this happy
deviation from the strict plan of state ownership originally
formed by King Leopold, the Belgian people are better satisfied
than any other with the present condition of their railroad
system. There is no popular disposition to dispose of
the State roads to private parties, and, while the service of
the roads in private hands is not manifestly inferior to that of
the public roads, there is no danger that the mixed system of
ownership which is the essence of the system will be broken
up by a popular clamor for a universal assumption of its railroads
by the State.

The curious result is thus finally arrived at that the two
typical railroad systems have worked round and almost completely
changed front. The English system, organized in a
complete reliance on competition, is tending both in England
and America more and more strongly towards regulation by
act of Parliament; while the Belgian, founded on the complete
negation of the power of competition under the circumstances,
has practically found competition, through a system
of mixed ownership, its effective weapon of control. Though
to a degree in this way approaching each other, the two systems
are still widely divergent, but it can hardly admit of any
question that, up to the present time, the railway system in
use in Belgium has furnished the community with a far more
efficient and reliable method of controlling and regulating the
levying of the transportation tax than has been furnished by
the system in use in England or America.

## Railroad Consolidation

Consolidation and stock-watering are two such prominent
features in the development of the railroad system,
and have attracted so much discussion, that they merit a separate
consideration. Consolidation is one form of that tendency
to combination which Stephenson referred to in his aphorism.
Combination in some shape, --- a union of forces under the influence
of an outside pressure, --- is one of the certain results of
any active competition; it is, in fact, a measure dictated by the
instinct of self-preservation. The simple question always is
whether the field in which the combination takes place is of a
kind which will admit of the union of all the agencies at work
in it. If it is, a close monopoly is almost sure to ensue. The
laws of competition thus have play just in proportion as these
agencies are too numerous for a perfectly united action. The
possession of, or at least some small share in a monopoly is
always very eagerly craved by the average man, while, on the
other hand, the progress of civilization, by multiplying agencies,
is continually increasing the difficulty of effecting a perfect
combination of any kind. Yet the difficulty which surrounds
the creation of a monopoly, and the resource and ingenuity
with which the creation of monopolies is pursued, seem to
move along with almost equal steps. The modern development
of the area of competing industries, for instance, would
seem to have rendered any combination of labor in general, to
affect its share in the profits of production, a practical impossibility;
but, on the contrary, the facility of intercourse between
all civilized countries seems to have developed the
possibility of combination to an even greater extent. The
consequence is that single associations claim that, from some
central office, they will at no remote day be able to control
the productions of skilled industry in conflict with capital
from the Baltic to the Gulf of Mexico. So it is with transportation.
The construction of as many channels of intercourse
as mankind saw fit to build would seem to have made
any monopoly of intercourse the dream of a visionary. Mankind
has, however, at least proved equal to the effort. The
operation of the natural law has not in this respect been
allowed to pass unchallenged.

The control of the intercourse between the interior basin of
the continent, drained by the St. Lawrence and the Mississippi
with their affluents, and the sea-board has naturally been the
great prize contended for among the railroads of America.
Formerly it seemed as though the Erie Canal and the Mississippi
River had insured a divided monopoly of this to the
cities of New York and New Orleans. Then the railroads
broke in upon the dispositions of nature, and, for a time, the
monopoly was effectually destroyed. Mankind, however, very
shortly rallied its energies, and the old struggle was renewed.
Science had now, in a great degree, superseded nature, and
the several artificial channels of intercourse and the men controlling
them were brought into sharp conflict. Each interest.
became anxious to strengthen itself, and to secure every advantage
over all others; and thus, by degrees, there resulted
a race of consolidation, until a very few little groups of
men practically controlled the whole railroad system of the
country.

There are four great thoroughfares connecting the several
Atlantic seaports with the interior of the continent, the
New York Central, the Erie, the Pennsylvania, and the Baltimore
and Ohio railroads. A sketch of the development and
present position of two of these will afford a sufficiently vivid
illustration of one phase, and unquestionably the most striking
one in the progress of consolidation.

Eighteen years ago the New York Central Road, which forms
the nucleus of the Vanderbilt combination, was not in existence
as a corporation. In 1853 it was chartered, and eleven distinct
corporations were merged into it. Five of these corporations,
the longest of which could boast but of 76 miles
of track, divided among them the 300 miles which separate
Albany from Buffalo. The corporation created out of these
elements was again, in its turn, merged in 1869 into the
larger New York Central & Hudson River Railroad Company,
which controls within the State of New York but little less
than a thousand miles of track, and is represented by rather
more than $100,000,000 of capital. The consolidation, so
far, was perfect and had taken place under a State law and
within State limits. Growth, however, did not stop here; the
combinations of capital simply adapted themselves to the forms
of a political system. Beyond the limits of New York, the
corporation held, in the eye of the law, no property; it did
not control a mile of track. At Buffalo, however, the Central
connected with another company, itself made up of four separate
primal links which had once connected Buffalo with Chicago,
and which had united in obedience to the same law of
development which had built up the Central. West of Chicago
came yet other links in the trans-continental chain. Three
lines competed to fill the gap which lay between Chicago and
the eastern terminus of the Pacific Road, --- the Northwestern,
the Rock Island, and the Burlington & Missouri. In the
autumn of 1869 the consolidation of the Central and the Hudson
River took place. Immediately afterwards, at the annual
election of the Lake Shore & Michigan Southern, the Vanderbilt
interest took open possession of that corporation, controlling
a majority of its stock. In May, 1870, it in like manner assumed
control of the Rock Island and Chicago & Northwestern.
The same parties in interest were now practically the owners
of a connected line of road from New York to Omaha; there
was no consolidation as yet, but, so far as the public and competing
roads were concerned, the close of 1870 found the six
parties, which but a short time before had been in possession
of the trans-continental thoroughfare, reduced to three. Without
taking into consideration the immense influence which
their position necessarily gave to them over other and less
powerful members of the railroad system, here was a single
combination of capital representing the control of at least 4,500
miles of road and not less than $250,000,000 of capital.

This, however, is but the result of a loose alliance between
men notorious for their feuds and their selfishness; the combination
is temporary, depending perhaps upon the continued life of
one who lacks little of being an octogenarian. The men who
control it not infrequently evince talents of a very high order,
and their course is made continually interesting by episodes of
dramatic surprise. They lack, however, the greatest and most
indispensable element of permanent success, --- some underlying,
indissoluble bond of union. In this respect they differ
entirely from the great combination which has gradually taken
shape in the neighboring State of Pennsylvania. What is
commonly known as the Pennsylvania Central Railroad Company
is probably to-day the most powerful corporation in the
world, as, indeed, it owns and operates one of the oldest of
railroads. Its organization, as compared with that of its
great rival, the New York Central, bears the relation of a
republic to an empire. Cæsarism is the principle of the
Vanderbilt group; the corporation is the essence of the Pennsylvania
system. The marked degree in which the character
of the people have given an insensible direction to the management
of their corporations in these two States is well deserving
of notice. In New York politics the individual leader
has ever been the centre; in Pennsylvania, always the party.
The people of this last State are not marked by intelligence ;
they are, in fact, dull, uninteresting, very slow and very persevering.
These are qualities, however, which they hold in
common with the ancient Romans, and they possess, also,
in a marked degree, one other characteristic of that classic
race, the power of organization, and through it of command.
They have always decided our Presidential elections; they
have always, in their dull, heavy fashion, regulated our economical
policy. Not open to argument, not receptive of
ideas, not given to flashes of brilliant execution, this State
none the less knows well what it wants, and knows equally
well how to organize to secure it. Its great railroad affords a
striking illustration in point. It is probably the most thoroughly
organized corporation, that in which each individual is
most entirely absorbed in the corporate whole, now in existence.
With its president and its four vice-presidents, each
of whom devotes his whole soul to his peculiar province,
whether it be to fight a rival line, to develop an inchoate
traffic, to manipulate the legislature, or to operate the road,
--- with this perfect machinery and subordination there is no
reason why the corporation should not assume absolute control
of all the railroads of Pennsylvania.

Such is this great corporation, high in credit in the moneymarkets
of the world, careful withal of its outward repute,
apparently unbounded in its resources. Organized so long
ago as 1831, it had thirty miles of road ready for operation
in the succeeding year. Not until 1854, however, was the
Pennsylvania Railroad proper completed. It then controlled
the line from Harrisburg to Pittsburg, 210 miles, which
had cost a little less than $17,000,000, and was represented
by about $12,000,000 of stock and $7,000,000 of
indebtedness. This might be considered the starting-point;
$3,500,000 of annual gross earnings on a capital a little less
than $ 20,000,000. For many years its growth was confined
to Pennsylvania. In 1869, however, its policy in this respect
underwent a change, and it burst through State limits, extending
its field of operations over the vast region lying between
the great lakes and the Ohio upon the north and south, and
the Missouri on the west. This sudden development was, as
usual, the immediate result of competition, and was almost
forced upon the corporation in spite of itself, as a measure of
defence. The secret history of the railway intrigues and legislative
manipulations of 1869 would make a very singular narrative
could the whole of it be disclosed. That year was, in
fact, a turning-point in our railway progress. The Erie management
had then fallen into confessed discredit, and was beginning
its remarkable attempt under Messrs. Gould and Fisk to carry
on a great commercial enterprise in absolute disregard of every
principle of good faith, commonly supposed to be at the basis
of civilized transactions. Those managing this thoroughfare
were desperately thrusting out in every direction, contracting,
buying, and leasing all adjoining roads with a rashness only
surpassed by their easy disregard of the obligations thus contracted.
Early in 1869 they sought to cut off the connections of
the Pennsylvania road and to shut it up within the limits of that
State. For a brief time the battle seemed to go in their favor,
but suddenly the tide turned. The result showed that they
were no match for the powerful antagonist they had provoked;
--- their overthrow was so effectual as to have in it some elements
of the ludicrous. Bills in the interest of the Pennsylvania
company, which it was doubtful if it were in the power of any
legislature to pass, were pushed through their various stages,
and received executive approval, with a speed unprecedented;
contracts, arranged with the Erie managers by boards of directors,
were unexpectedly rejected in meetings of stockholders;
and for a time this irresistible power even threatened to wrest.
from the Erie road its own peculiar and long-established connections.
The result of these operations was that the Pennsylvania
Central soon controlled by perpetual lease a whole
system of roads radiating to all points in the West and Southwest.
By one it reached Chicago, by another St. Louis, and
by a third Cincinnati. At Indianapolis it had absorbed a network
of routes; at Chicago and St. Louis it had formed close
connections looking directly towards the Pacific. Here for a
time it rested, declaring that its policy did not look to any
expansion beyond the Mississippi. The corporation rested,
perhaps, but not the ambitious men who controlled it; their
individual operations now commenced. They obtained the
control of roads endowed with vast land grants in Michigan
and in Minnesota; they were the directors of the Northern
Pacific; and when the men who had constructed the Union
Pacific broke down under the multiplicity of their engagements,
the first vice-president of the Pennsylvania road appeared
as the new president of that road also. The very land
grants belonging to the companies these men now controlled
amounted to 80,000 square miles, or an area equivalent to
the aggregate possessions of four of the existing kingdoms of
Europe.

Meanwhile the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, distinct
from its individual directors, now owned or held by lease
400 miles of road in Pennsylvania, and directly controlled
450 miles more, almost entirely within the same State;
beyond its limits it leased and operated nearly two thousand
miles in addition, holding the stock and bonds of railroads,
canals, towns, and cities, like some vast _Credit Mobilier_; it
had, indeed, no less than $20,000,000 standing on its books
as represented by these investments. In the sixteen years its
own capital and indebtedness had swollen from $20,000,000
to $65,000,000, with a liberty secured to increase them to
nearly $100,000,000; at the same time the system of roads
which it held in its hands returned a yearly income of hardly
less than $40,000,000, of which about $10,000,000 was
claimed as net profit.

If, however, as its direction had officially declared, the corporation
had no distinct interests to push west of the Mississippi,
the same could not be said of the region east of the
Susquehanna. In the closing days of 1870 New York was
suddenly startled by the announcement that the Pennsylvania
Railroad had effected a perpetual lease of the whole famous
railroad monopoly known as the United Companies of New
Jersey. The rumor proved true, and some 450 miles of additional
track, besides 65 miles of canals and some 30 steamers,
in all some $35,000,000 of property was by this transaction
added to the vast consolidation, and brought it to the shores
of New York Harbor.

It is unnecessary to consider how much further this combination
will carry its operations, or in what they will result.
The Pennsylvania road now controls directly and as
itself owner or proprietor, and wholly distinct from its directors,
more than 3,000 miles of track, claiming to represent
$175,000,000 of securities, and returning a gross income of at
least $40,000,000 per annum. It is far from impossible that
this combination may from its very magnitude lead to its own
downfall. The leasing of roads has not generally proved a
source of profit, and there are indications that the Pennsylvania
Railroad Company will not find its own case an exception
to this rule. Upon the leases of four roads, which netted
a gross income of over $15,000,000 in 1870, the returns
seemed to indicate a profit to the leasing corporation of only
$128,000; while, estimated upon the returns of the year
previous to that in which the lease was made, the New Jersey
contract would seem to involve a heavy annual payment in
excess of net receipts. For years a general crash in the
American railroad system has been very commonly predicted.
Those are not wanting who now confidently insist that the
shadow of the United States Bank rests heavily upon the Pennsylvania
Railway, and that the closing pages in the histories
of the two institutions will not be dissimilar. Should this apprehension
prove true, the crash, when it comes, will probably
be coincident with the fall of the Pennsylvania consolidation.

Meanwhile, whatever the future may bring forth, it is impossible
to repress a feeling of admiration, mixed with vague
alarm, at the steady massive growth of this corporation. Its
method of procedure is so silent, so organized, and so sure, that
it has already cast a spell over the mind and conscience of the
State which created it. Compared with the magnitude and
order of its proceedings, the results achieved by the other combinations
seem but the freaks of stock-jobbers. The Pennsylvanians
are reducing consolidation to a science and mastering
the whole subject of transportation, while their various rivals
are dabbling in railroads and amassing individual fortunes.
As between the two combinations the growth of which has
here been sketched, it would seem not unsafe to predict that
the solidity of the latter company is almost certain ultimately
to overcome the _élan_ of the former.

Only one phase of consolidation is as yet presented in the
great east and west thoroughfares, --- the consolidation brought
about through the stress of competition. No consolidation of
the competing thoroughfares has hitherto been effected, though
several times it has been attempted. Instances of this on a
smaller scale are, however, by no means wanting, and perhaps
no combination in the whole history of the railroad system,
has ever been more suggestive than that effected in the winter
of 1870--71 among the anthracite coal-roads of Pennsylvania;
it illustrated in almost every possible way both the
fallacies of railroad competition and the inefficiency of the
attempts hitherto made to secure the railroad monopoly from
abuse through legislation.

The production of anthracite coal had increased, under the
influence of an artificial stimulus, from one million tons in
1842, up to nearly seventeen millions in 1870. The country
did not really require such a production, and the usual severe
struggle ensued as supply and demand sought the same level.
There were four parties in the field, --- the consumers, the
miners, the coal companies, and the railroads. The consumers
alone could not combine; all others could and did. The
miners combined for an increase of wages, and refused to produce;
the coal companies combined against excessive freights,
and refused to forward; the railroad corporations combined to
raise freights, and refused to carry. The inevitable results
ensued; coal in the same market fluctuated many hundred %; the miners starved, the coal companies failed, and the
railroads became unprofitable. There was but one way out
of the difficulty, --- a closer combination between two of the
contending parties to secure a mastery over the third. The
coal companies and the railroads accordingly combined, and
the railroads became the largest owners of mines.

The contest was now a simple one between labor and capital.
Between 1867 and 1870 the struggles and consequent
fluctuations were incessant; there was a constant recurrence
of strikes, resumptions under agreement, violations of agreement,
and suspensions of production. The parties then
resorted to amicable arrangements, by which strikes were pretended,
and surplus coal was sold off to consumers at panic
prices under the fear of an impending scarcity. This, however,
was a trick which would not bear frequent repetition,
and when, at last, in 1870 it became evident that production
was again in excess of consumption, and that a glut was impending,
the two parties drew together their forces for a
decisive conflict. The miners struck for what they considered
a remunerative basis for their labor, and the companies combined
to starve them out. They not only ceased to produce
from their own mines, but they trebled their freights, and thus
put a stop to production by all others. The result was not
only great inconvenience and suffering throughout the country,
but a violent disturbance of industry, and, in Pennsylvania,
there resulted almost a condition of civil war.

So far the efficacy of railroad competition alone was illustrated,
but in Pennsylvania, as elsewhere, legislation had
sought to make good all possible deficiencies in the working
of natural laws. Recourse was had to the statutebook,
and the charters of the corporations were eagerly
examined. The corporations, it will be remembered, not
only insisted upon stopping all production from their own
mines, but they also, through prohibitory tariffs, put a
practical stop to production from all other mines. As transporters
of a commodity they once for all undertook to regulate
both demand and supply as regarded that commodity. A long
conflict before the legislature ensued, and the effect of the law
was discussed. It was found that, in the charters of the
roads, the amounts which could be charged as "tolls" were
alone limited. The courts had held long before, and when the
question had come up in a different connection, that "tolls"
were a mere charge on the passage of a person or article over
a road or through a canal, where no service in aid of such
passage beyond furnishing the thoroughfare were included;
where the party owning the thoroughfare likewise furnished
the means of transportation a further sum as freight could be
charged, no limit to which had been assigned by law. In
other words the law provided only for the use of the road, and
not for services as a common carrier.

The railroad combination was thus left master of the field,
and it only remained for the courts, after slow process, to reaffirm
or reverse their former decision. For the time being
the combined companies had carried the day. It would be
futile, however, to suppose that this is the end of the difficulty
in Pennsylvania. At the present time the question as to the
intent of the law is again before the courts. The carrying it
there was a very dangerous move on the part of the railroad
companies, for whatever the result may be it may safely be
predicted that they have pushed their reserved rights too far.
The difficulty lies beyond the reach of any court of law; it will
be found to be nothing less than the breaking down of the
guarantees hitherto relied upon to protect the community
against the abuse of great powers by private monopolies. It
required just such a combination of circumstances as exists in
Pennsylvania to raise this question. Elsewhere it has only
threatened; here it must now be confronted.

The examples of combination hitherto discussed have been
those of a more elementary nature, --- those which would naturally
be looked for in the earlier and less complex days of a
system. It is extremely unlikely, however, that this process
will stop with the permanent consolidation of certain connecting
lines, as in the case of the Pennsylvania Central, or in the
temporary combination of certain competing lines, as in the
case of the anthracite coal railroads. Indications are not
wanting that the forms of concentration hitherto described
are but one, and not the most significant, phase of the working
of general law. It is the one which most effectively and
dramatically presents itself to the public, but it is not improbable
that a more important revolution is now in rapid
progress. Properly to understand the origin and possible
scope of this movement, a retrospect is necessary.

What is known as the express system of America is a very
peculiar and convenient, though expensive, organization, wholly
the creation of this country and of the present generation. The
men who have since given their names to immense companies,
wielding millions of capital, began their brilliant careers in a
very modest way. To the Harndens belongs the credit of
originating the business. They began operations in 1839,
passing to and fro between Boston and New York, carpet-bag
in hand; but that carpet-bag was big with the express system
of America. At first they undertook little more than to carry
money, letters, and valuables, to make collections, and to see
to the delivery of very small parcels between the two cities;
but the carpet-bag soon expanded into a trunk; the trunk
developed into a crate, and each new crate contained more
and more cubic feet until at last they became freight-cars,
and the managers grasped at the internal carrying trade. For
several years the receipts of the route between Boston and
New York hardly exceeded fifty dollars a day, out of which
fares, salaries, office-rent, wages, and costs of delivery had to
be paid. The machinery, however, was needed; new lines
were organized, opposition started up, and, when Harnden
died in 1845, only thirty-three years old, the business was
practically as fully developed as it is to-day. In 1868 there
were over 3,000 licensed express carriers and agents in the
country, paying an Internal Revenue tax on more than
$22,000,000 of gross receipts. Even as early as 1845 the
organization had brought about a division of the carriage of
freight. The most valuable and remunerative part of it, the
carrying of all small and valuable packages, which demand
little room and pay heavy rates, had passed out of the hands
of the railroads into those of the express companies. At
one time the system seemed likely to monopolize, by means
of its despatch lines, the whole business of "time freights,"
and to draw to itself the carriage of all articles, no matter how
bulky, on which persons were willing to pay the price necessary
to insure speedy delivery. The wealth of the companies
was so great, and their influence ramified so far, that the management
of railroads in a great degree passed under their control.
Officers of the latter corporations suddenly found themselves
considerable holders of express stocks, or openly received
bribes. The result was that some of these officials observed
with indifference, or even connived at, the great inroads which
the express system was making on the legitimate freighting
business of their lines, and nothing was practically done to
check the rapid growth of the express companies, until the
system of "time freights" was inaugurated by the railroads
themselves, in 1858. This was the first step taken by them
towards the resumption of their legitimate business, and this
was forced upon the roads by the strenuous exertions of business
men. The system of time freights once inaugurated, the
attention of railroad managers was soon aroused to the possible
profits to be derived from its development. Naturally, this
development took the form of a job. Certain men, controlling
great through lines, conceived the idea of forming a company
which should be nothing more than an immense freight express
line, owning its own cars and charging its own prices,
while the railroads were to supply only road-beds and motivepower,
and charge tolls for drawing cars over their lines. The
system of moving freights by canal, in accordance with which
all the original railroad charters were drawn, was in fact revived
and applied to railroads. This scheme promised to carry
to the last possible point of development the express system.
The business of carrying freights in their own interest was to
be surrendered by the railroad companies, who were henceforth
to devote themselves to the transportation of passengers
and the dragging of freight-cars. If properly instituted, and
regulated with thorough impartiality, with a view to a perfectly
free competition between firms engaged in the shipping
business, such a system would not be without its advantages.
It would create a division of labor, and, if favoritism were
excluded, would tend to stimulate competition. It was, however,
brought forward with no such views. The men who
devised it controlled the roads over which it was to be put in
operation. Competition was the last thing they had in view ;
on the contrary, they proposed to monopolize in their private
hands the whole lucrative business of time freights. It was
an immense job. The credit of defeating this ingenious plan
belongs, it is said, to the president of a leading New England
road. His concurrence in the enterprise was essential to its
success; but, when the plan was submitted to him, he refused
to have anything to do with it, except in his official capacity
and in the interest of his road. He saw at once the great importance
of the scheme, and how profitable it might be made,
but he insisted that the roads, and not individuals, should be
the parties to it, and that to them all the profits should accrue.
This action on his part ultimately led to the formation of the
earliest of what are known as the "colored lines." It was
organized in 1865, and was substantially a corporation within
a corporation. Certain contracting roads between the west
and tide-water combined in contributing a number of cars, all
of which were to be distinguished by a uniform color. These
were to transport freights, under special conditions, from any
point of reception to any point of delivery on the connecting
roads. The machinery for the collection and disbursement
of money was the simplest possible. A clearing-house was
established, the duties of which were confined to keeping a
record of the miles run by the cars of the various roads in the
combination, and to striking, accordingly, a balance of credit
or debit each month. A small percentage upon the amount
invested was then charged for wear and tear, and a balancesheet
forwarded to each company. All transactions in regard
to freights were settled in cash when they took place, and no
receipts were returned to the clearing-house. A business involving
millions each month could thus be done on the payment
of trifling monthly balances. The growth of this system
has been one of the marvels of railroad development. So far
as the business of transporting freight is concerned, it will be
seen at once that these organizations effected a practical consolidation
of all the roads interested in them. The result
hitherto has been one of almost unmixed good. Responsibility
was secured; consignees were no longer bandied about
between numerous disconnected forwarders, each one of whom
shoved liability off upon his neighbor. Promptitude, also,
was secured by the introduction of time contracts, and, with
simplicity, of course came economy.

There are three peculiarly significant features in the history
of these organizations,--- the creation of corporations within
corporations, the establishment of a clearing-house, and the
rapid growth of the system. It is not impossible that these
innovations may result in a revolution of the freighting business,
perhaps of the railroad system. The essential feature of
the organization is the combining of roads, whether competing
or connecting, through the machinery of a clearing-house.
This once established, the extent of its possible development
cannot be forecast. If a corporation within a corporation, including,
as it easily might, a central tribunal practically empowered
to enforce its own judgments should gradually be developed
out of this beginning, it is more than probable that
the days of railroad competition would be numbered. It is
absurd to suppose that, after the creation of such a central
power, the force necessary to make its decision effective would
be wanting. No single member, however powerful, of a combination
of the sort suggested, could afford to rebel, when the
immediate result of so doing would be that it would be thrown
out of the clearing-house and its connections cut.

Neither will it be possible to meet by legislation such a contingency
as that suggested. Congress or State legislatures
may, indeed, enact by statute that connecting roads shall receive
freights from or deliver them to any recusant line; but
here their power stops. They cannot by any law, no matter
how stringent or cunningly devised, control the direction which
may be given to the immense mass of freight which merely
seeks a transit from one part of the continent to another;
neither can they dictate as to the use of rolling-stock, which
includes the vital-point of breaking bulk. Both of these matters
obey a law of their own, and merchandise once passing
under the control and into the cars of a combination, will, of
necessity, follow the channel into which it is directed. No relief
could be found from this quarter, even supposing that a
combination wielding the immense political influence which
would be possessed by that suggested could not regulate legislation
to suit itself. The present time-freight lines may, therefore,
contain the germ of that consolidation which shall weld
the railroad interests together as one body, and give to them
the unity and concentration which hitherto they have notoriously
lacked. This result of the experiment of 1865 would
seem by no means so unlikely as that from one carpet-bag in
1838 should spring the present express system of America.

It is much the custom among those who discuss this consolidating
phase in the development of a great system to denounce
it as an unmitigated commercial and political evil. It remains
to consider whether these judgments are fully warranted. So
far as the interests of commerce and of intercourse in general
are concerned such conclusions do not seem to be sustained by a
calmer examination of the results in so far as they are yet developed.
On the contrary, it may safely be asserted that, taken
as a whole, the advance hitherto made in the direction of a
closer and more perfect combination has been highly beneficial
to the best interests both of trade and of travel. All declamation
to the contrary notwithstanding, this conclusion hardly
admits of a doubt. Even in the case of the Pennsylvania coal
combination, unjustifiable as in many respects it was, so far as
the material interests of the whole country were concerned a
responsible combination even of monopolies, insuring a steady
supply at regular prices, was preferable to the chronic chaos
previously existing. This case, however, was purely exceptional.
As a general rule it will scarcely be maintained that
it is to small, local or disconnected lines that the public now
looks for the last conveniences and comforts of travel, or for
the most prompt and cheapest transportation of freight. On
the contrary, it is only the consolidated corporations whose
means admit of that freedom of expenditure and minute division
of labor which is essential to perfect ease of modern movement,
whether of merchandise or of persons. It may in fact
be broadly stated as a general rule, to which no exceptions
exist, that, wherever there is a break in management in the
railroad system, the intercourse of the community experiences
a jar or shock, the sense of which is lessened in the exact
degree in which such break of management is overcome by a
closer connection.

It may be argued that this applies only to the combination
of connecting, and not to that of competing lines. It is by
no means clear, however, whether, when fairly considered in
all its aspects, even this distinction is well taken. The subject
has already been somewhat discussed in its connection
with railroad competition and the practice of "pooling profits."
On the one side are to be estimated the decided
advantages of the superior promptness and convenience, the
desire to secure every improved appliance, whether of comfort
or safety, which results from a competition, which, in these
respects, is always felt, and also the more modified advantage
of charges which are occasionally unduly low; --- upon the
other hand, it is to be remembered that competition is confined
to points of convergence, that excessive local rates
always make good depressed through rates, that violent fluctuations
characterize sharp competition, and, finally, that the
absence of responsibility must perpetuate every abuse. Even
upon this point we are by no means without a practical experience.
No people ever enjoyed more fully the advantages of
competing lines than did the inhabitants of certain portions
of the State of Vermont during the long struggle between the
Vermont Central road and the Rutland & Burlington; each of
these corporations strove for years to steal business from the
other, and illustrated every feature of railroad competition.
After more than fifteen years of disturbance, during which the
people, whom the roads were built to accommodate, were sacrificed
to their quarrels, the companies at last consolidated amid
public rejoicing. The war of through competition and local suffering
was over, and one uniform, responsible management gave
some assurance that the railroad service of a whole community
should cease to be the shuttlecock of angry combatants.

Neither are the political considerations connected with
these vast corporations often fairly considered. The evils
under our form of government connected with railroad legislation,
in any shape, cannot easily be overstated. It is very
questionable, however, whether they are aggravated by the
existence of great consolidations. One fact is to be borne in
mind. If the political power of the large consolidation is
great, so also is the jealousy and apprehension excited by it.
In this respect also, there comes in the important element of
responsibility :--- the great corporation presents a point upon
which the force of public opinion can be concentrated; --- it
thus bears with it its own element of weakness. This is not
the case with smaller companies. They can and do combine
for political action with most pernicious results to the public;
but in this case, though the power is in reality greater, the
responsibility is wholly divided away. What is known as
"log-rolling" is probably the most familiar form of legislative
corruption in general use in America. No bribes are paid, no
money changes hands, but a regular truck-and-dicker of votes
takes place, through which wholly incongruous schemes are
lumped together and passed, regardless of opposition. In this
contemptible science the lesser railroad corporations are apt to
be the most thorough proficients. Each has its little band of
friends, and each is apt to want its rag of special legislation.
Individually, they are powerless, but in combination with the
friends of every other doubtful measure they are irresistible.
Their obscurity is their great protection. From behind it
they raise the cry against the larger companies, concerning
which a jealousy is known to exist, and, while the public attention
is absorbed in another direction, they quietly secure
their plunder. To a large corporation, on the other hand,
there attaches in some degree that responsibility which belongs
to a high public official. Its agents are known, its
operations are jealously watched, it can be held to a public
account. Where, in short, it would be perfectly feasible for the
community to meet and control a single agent, all experience
goes to show that a dozen may run riot.

As regards the consolidation of railroads, therefore, the case
may be summed up somewhat as follows. Both railroad combination
and railroad consolidation, are the legitimate and inevitable
consequence of railroad competition, and, as such, like
all other phases of natural development, are not easily to be
restrained by legislative enactments. That they may not result
in serious political and material complications is by no means
clear, but these are not likely to be of the character hitherto
anticipated. If, as now seems to be the case, the exigencies
of our civilization force upon us this concentrating process,
there must ultimately result a condition of things which can
be resolved only in one of two ways; --- either the community,
as it has already done in certain of the States, must face, and
endeavor to control, a recognized railroad monopoly in responsible
private hands; or it must directly, in a greater or less
degree, take part in its management, thus recognizing the
control of the railroad system as one of the necessary, and for
that reason, legitimate functions of every government. At
present, as respects consolidation, both the railroad system
and public opinion are in a state of simple confusion. Vague
denunciation and crude statute enactments have hitherto
usurped the place of reason and mature action, and it now
remains to be seen what effect they will have upon a development
which they may distort but cannot prevent.

## Stock-Watering

Properly speaking stock-watering is the reappraisal by
its owners of a corporate property which has, or is alleged
to have, increased in value on their hands, without any
new outlay upon their part, and the issue to themselves of new
evidences of value equal to such supposed increase. It is
indisputable that, as regards railroads, this practice has been
not infrequently very grossly abused, especially of late years,
and that these abuses of it now impose a very heavy additional
burden upon the cost of transportation. Fraudulent
and secret issues of stock by corrupt managements or dishonest
officials have also contributed to this result, but the transaction
in this case differs from strict stock-watering in much
the same way as the money of counterfeiters differs from
excessive issues by government of irredeemable legal tenders.
Both processes directly inflate the volume of the securities
which represent the value of the railroad system, and, in so
far, constitute stock-watering, but while the first is, strange to
say, legitimate in character, the last is a mere fraud.

In America, as in England, the private corporation owning
the thoroughfare is the basis of the whole railroad system.
In thus surrendering the control of this system out of its own
hands, the community as a rule made one and but one reservation
in its own favor; it was almost universally stipulated
that the rate of profit upon the capital invested in the work
of construction should not exceed a certain annual percentage,
varying, according to locality, from 10 to 20%. Within
this limit the corporations were free to earn and to divide all
that they could.

This constituted the railroad usury law, and like all usury
laws was an exceedingly clumsy contrivance. It had two obvious
defects; no provision was made for ascertaining the real,
as contradistinguished from the nominal cost of any road, and
nothing was said in regard to arrears of unpaid dividends. It
was absurd to suppose that even the most honest capitalist
would accept the strict construction of a law which insured
him a certain loss in each bad year or unprofitable enterprise,
and limited him in case of success to a reasonable profit. Of
course, therefore, the law was no sooner enacted than it was
circumvented. How this was done in England has already
been stated, but it is in America that the process has been
conducted on the most magnificent scale. The principle operated
upon in both countries was the same. The doubt raised
was whether the stipulated percentage was to be paid upon
what the property cost its holders, or upon what it was actually
worth. Interpreting it in the way last specified, the capitalist
proceeded to act accordingly. The result as a whole
bids fair to be most disastrous, and yet, in not a few cases, it
is very difficult to take any just exception to it. Many roads
were constructed, and proved, if not commercial failures, very
gradual successes; for years no dividends were paid, --- the
money which should have gone to dividends, which rightfully
belonged to the capitalists, was absorbed in construction.
Fairly speaking, this was so much new capital belonging to the
owners, and by them invested in the enterprise; just as much
so as if the allotted dividends had been paid to the stockholder
and by him instantly handed back to the treasurer of
the company. In the vast majority of other cases very small
dividends were paid, far below the limit fixed in the law, and
the balance found its way into construction. In all of these
instances heavy arrears accumulated against the property, and
these arrears might fairly and justly be claimed as capital,
actually paid in, and which should be represented by evidences
of value. Wherever stock was issued under such circumstances
the operation would not seem justly open to criticism.
The difficulty was that no provision whatever had been made
in the law to meet the case. It therefore devolved upon the
owners of the property to cast up the balance-sheet themselves,
and to decide all nice points, undoubtedly in their own favor.
Where a people so provides for its own interests it needs no
prophet to foretell the consequences. No landlord deals in
this way with a tenant.

The history of the companies which have been consolidated
into what is known as the Pittsburg Fort Wayne &
Chicago Railroad, furnishes a very fair illustration of what
may be expected to ensue from this disregard of ordinary
precautions. Here the process of watering was early commenced,
as a simple and desperate expedient for raising
money at an enormous discount for the purpose of completing
an enterprise of doubtful success. In the earlier history
of one of these companies we read: "The stock subscriptions
which were paid in cash into the treasury of the company were
very small, --- amounting perhaps, in all, to less than three
% on the final cost of building and equipping the road.
The stock subscriptions were paid for mostly in uncultivated
lands, farms, town lots, and labor upon the road." Of the
whole road as it stands we are told, that, "of the $ 18,663,876,
now representing the cost of the road and equipment, &c., the
shareholders contributed in cash only about ten %, or
less than $2,000,000; and their contributions in cash, bonds,
notes, lands, and personal property, labor, &c., amounted to
something less than $4,000,000, or rather more than twenty
% of the present cost of the work. The difference between
this sum and the capital stock as now shown by the
books of the company, is made up of dividends which were
_paid in stock_, interest on stock _paid in stock_, premium on
stock allowed to stockholders at the time of consolidation,
which was _paid in stock_, and a balance of stock still held by
the trustees.

This, however, was in the early days of the enterprise, the
days of doubtful success, when the stock was thought worthless,
and was almost given away. But in 1866 a new era
dawned upon the Fort Wayne road; it began to pay dividends.
In 1870 the stock of the company, the history of
a portion of which has just been given, stood at $11,500,000,
while its indebtedness amounted to about $13,600,000 more,
being in all some $1,150,000 above the cost of road and
equipment as they stood upon the books of the company.
In June of this year, a lease was effected of the entire property
by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. The Fort
Wayne stockholders had their option between annual dividends
of 12% on the stock then in existence, or the
more moderate rate of 7% on a proportionately increased
amount. They wisely chose the latter, and forthwith
the $11,500,000 of stock became $19,714,000,--- while the
road which was claimed to have cost only $ 24,000,000, was
suddenly represented by $33,400,000 of securities, none of
which bore a less interest than 7%.

The great masterpieces of Commodore Vanderbilt have, however,
so eclipsed all other performances in this line that they
may be said to constitute an epoch in the history of paper inflation,
--- it might also be said of bubble-blowing. It is only
necessary, therefore, in this connection, to recount the history
of the chain of roads, now reduced in number to two, which
connect New York and Chicago by way of Albany. The distance
between these points is 982 miles. It is useless to
begin the story further back than 1852, when the through
line was completed, consisting of sixteen independent links,
several of which were themselves made up of numerous
smaller and once independent roads. That was a year of
active and much needed consolidation. The New York Central
led off under a special act of legislature. Eleven roads
went into the consolidation with an aggregate capital of $23,235,600.
The stock lowest in value of the eleven was settled
upon as the par of the new concern, and the stocks of
the other ten companies were received at a premium varying
from 17 to 55%. By this simple financial arrangement,
$8,894,500 of securities, of which not one cent was
ever represented by property, but which in reality constituted
so much guaranteed stock, was made a charge, principal
and interest, against future income. This was the price
paid to get rid of the vested rights which had been allowed
to settle down upon this thoroughfare. Between 1852 and
1868 the stock and indebtedness of the consolidated company
had been increased, for one reason or another, until,
when Mr. Vanderbilt became president in the latter year,
they amounted in round numbers to $40,000,000, representing
a road which its construction account showed had cost
$36,600,000. Vanderbilt had for some years been president
of the Hudson River road, and, as such, in 1867 had doubled
its capital stock, ($ 7,000,000), calling in 50% of the
increased amount and thus watering to the extent of $3,500,000. Extending his control over the Central, he now proceeded
to better his previous instructions. A stock dividend of
80%, not a dollar of which was called in, was suddenly
declared. Over $23,000,000 of securities were thus created
at once. Operations stood still at this point, but only for a
moment. The next measure was a consolidation of the Central
and the Hudson River railroads. This was effected in the
succeeding year upon a stock basis of $90,000,000; --- a further
watering of 27% being allotted to the Central,
while the turn of the Hudson River road now having come again,
there was provided for it the munificent amount of 85%. The result of these astounding feats of financial legerdemain
was that a property which in 1866 appeared from its
own books to have cost less then $50,000,000, and which was
than represented by over $54,000,000 of stock and indebtedness,
was suddenly shot up to over $103,000,000 in 1870,
upon the whole of which interest and dividends were paid. At
the same time the cost of the road stood upon the books of
the company at less than $60,000,000, or about $70,000 per
mile, while in evidences of property each mile was charged
with no less than $122,000. The average cost of railroads
throughout the world has been somewhat less than $ 100,000
per mile, while in America it has stood at about half of that
amount. According to the books of the company over
$50,000 of absolute water has been poured out for each mile
of road between New York and Buffalo.

The next step towards Chicago was one of 88 miles to Erie.
This was made up of a consolidation of two roads effected in
1867, which went in with $2,800,000 of capital and came out
with $5,000,000. The total capital account of the company
was then a trifle over $3,200,000. In 1869 the consolidation
of the lines between Buffalo and Chicago was effected, and
this road became a party to it with $ 6,000,000 of stock and
$4,000,000 of indebtedness, --- at least 30% of water
in excess of all cost of construction.

The next step in the line is one of 96 miles to Cleveland;
this was filled by the celebrated Cleveland Painesville & Ashtabula
road, which in the six years between 1862--67 divided
120% in stock, 33% in bonds, and 79%
in cash. Having really cost less than $5,000,000 in money
it was consolidated at nearly $12,000,000.

The next step was from Cleveland to Toledo, 148 miles.
Here it was that Vanderbilt began his operations, for in 1866
he secured possession of this road and signalized his administration
of its affairs by the issuing of a scrip dividend of 25% upon its $5,000,000 of capital.

The last two roads were consolidated into the Lake Shore
road, 258 miles in length, in 1867; the stock and indebtedness
of the new company was $22,000,000. In 1869 the
work of consolidation was perfected from Buffalo to Chicago
by the merging of all the connecting links into the Lake Shore
& Michigan Southern Railroad Co., operating nearly 1,300
miles of road, represented by $57,000,000 of stock and indebtedness,
which was increased to $62,000,000 in 1871, and
which it had the further privilege of increasing to about
$73,000,000. These figures throw a very curious light upon
the real cost of railroad construction in America. They represent
a nominal outlay of but $48,000 per mile, and yet
it is not denied that in the amount was included $20,000,000
of fictitious capital. These roads, not improbably, may have
cost those who constructed them in cash, actually paid in either
directly in money or in dividends which had never been drawn
out, the full amount of the consolidation capital. The profits
had, it is true, been very unequally divided, but substantial
justice was done in the end; what had been lost in one road
was made good in another, but as a whole the community was,
perhaps, paying for nothing which it had not received. No
credit on this account is due to those managing the affairs of
the company. They undoubtedly regarded the Vanderbilt
operations as masterpieces of railroad management, and only
regretted that the earnings of the company under their control
could by no possibility justify any similar performances;
and yet the contrast between the results hitherto arrived
at upon this line, under a system of moderate, average watering,
and those achieved further east by Vanderbilt is singularly
suggestive. It is probably safe to say that the
Vanderbilt stock-waterings between Buffalo and New York annually
cost the American people not less than $3,000,000 in
excess of all remuneration which ever under any construction
of right belonged to the owners of the lines. Under
these circumstances it would seem, judging by the example
of the Lake Shore road, that comparatively legitimate and
reasonable waterings should satisfy any one not inordinately
rapacious.

The science of stock-watering as thus far described had not
yet, however, attained perfection; in fact had not gone beyond
the English precedents. What might be called the American
system remains to be described. The stock of corporations is
in this country given away as a sort of gratuity, --- the right
to direct railways and to tax trade is habitually thrown in
as a makeweight. In the earlier days of railroad financiering
it would naturally have seemed almost impossible to
accomplish such a result, but time and experience brought
even this about. It originated in the system of railroad
mortgages. Very early, and very naturally in the immature
days of the system, attempts were made to construct railways
upon an insufficient capital. Funds gave out before the enterprises
were half developed, and projectors had their election
between abandonment or progress at any price. The obvious
resource was to mortgage the property already in existence.
Soon the market was weighed down with every conceivable
description of railroad security. First there was a floating
debt; then preference stock, to be followed in rapid succession
by first, second, and third mortgages; construction
and equipment bonds closing up the dreary procession, which
not seldom ended at the tomb of a receivership. All these
evidences of indebtedness were, however, secured on property
really in existence. The art was not at once discovered of
mortgaging something thereafter to be created. Presently
new roads were projected, the business of railroad construction
and financiering being now reduced to a system. The country
through which these roads were to pass was young and poor,
and capital had to be brought in from outside. There was
abundance of it, but the risk involved was great, and the
temptation to incur it must not be small. In the first place,
the new road as an enterprise promises well. The next thing
is to raise the money necessary to construct it. This is done,
not by laying an assessment upon the stock,--- that is not
heard of as yet, and has no value in the market,--- it exists
only in name. In place of this, the bonds are put upon the
market at a stated price, which, or a portion of which, is
advanced by the capitalist, and construction is carried on
with the proceeds. The stock itself then passes as a gratuity
into the hands of those advancing money upon the bonds.
(The result is, that by this ingenious expedient the capitalist
holds a mortgage, paying a secured and liberal interest, on
his own property, which has been conveyed to him forever
for nothing. The stock is at once nothing and everything.
Given away, the donees own and manage the road, and,
receiving a fixed and assured interest upon their bonds, enjoy
a further right to exact an additional sum, and one as
large as they are able to make it, from the developing business
of the country, as dividends on the stock. Instances of this
form of railroad financiering need not be specified, for it
is now the common course of Western railroad construction.
The new country needs its railroads, and is willing to pay anything
for them, while the capitalists of the old country specify
their own terms of construction, which are only too eagerly
accepted.

So far as those immediately involved in these transactions
are concerned no exception can be taken to them. Both are
fair and equal contracting parties, and both understand the
bargain they make. The occupant of the new country wants
his railroad, and the capitalist is asked to embark his means
in an enterprise full of risk. They both make the best terms
they can, but the terms are made in advance; there is no
fraud and no chicane. While, therefore, the contract is not
unfair as a private transaction, as a matter of public policy
such a method of railroad construction cannot but excite very
lively apprehensions for the future. The community, in its
over eagerness to stimulate construction beyond all healthy
limit, is continually binding itself to conditions which hereafter
it will find very hard to fulfil.

The absolute disposal of the control of a road and all its
securities, on condition that it is built, would seem to be a
contract of a sufficiently sweeping nature, and it certainly
marks the limit of legitimate railroad construction. Not
seldom, however, the embryotic enterprise is bolstered up
extraneously. Simple mortgages are not sufficient, and the
credit of the road is guaranteed by land-grants, or by national
or state or town or county loans, or by the credit of
connecting or established lines, or by any or all of these
combined. Every expedient which the mind of man can devise
has been brought into play to secure to the capitalist
the largest possible profit, with the least possible risk. The
Pacific Railroad furnishes a fine example of all these ingenious
devices. In speaking of this enterprise it is not pleasant
to adopt a tone of criticism towards the able and daring men
who with such splendid energy forced it through to completion.
It was a work of great national import and of untold
material value. Those who took its construction in hand incurred
great risk, and at one time trembled on the verge of
ruin. This enterprise was to them a lottery, in which they
might well draw a blank, but, should they draw a prize, the
greatness of the prize must justify the risk incurred. The
community asked them to assume the risk, and was willing to
reward their success. Success was thought to be well worth all
it might cost. At the same time the process of construction
afforded a curious example of the methods through which
fictitious evidences of value can be piled upon each other.
The length of the united road was 1919 miles, and the cost
of construction was estimated at $60,000,000. To meet this
outlay a stock capital was authorized of $100,000,000 for each
of the two great divisions of the line; upon this, however, no
dependence was placed as a means of raising money; it was
only a debt to be imposed, if possible, on the future business
of the country. A curious mystery hangs over this part of
the financial arrangements of the concern. Probably not
$20,000,000 ever has been, or ever will be, derived from this
source. The rest is very clear. There was the government
subsidy of $30,000 a mile, and $30,000 a mile of mortgage
indebtedness; there was a land grant of $12,800 acres a mile,
and, where there were States, there were bonds, with interest
guaranteed by the State and gifts of real estate from cities,
where cities existed; and there were even millions of net earning
applied to construction. The means to build the road were
not grudgingly bestowed. Meanwhile, of the real cost of construction
but little is correctly known; absolutely nothing indeed
of the western division, or Central Pacific. Managed by
a small clique in California, the internal arrangements of this
company were involved in absolute secrecy. The eastern
division was built, however, by an organization known as the
_Credit Mobilier_, which received for so doing all the unissued
stock, the proceeds of the bonds sold, the government bonds,
and the earnings of the road, --- in fact, all its available
assets. Its profits were reported to have been enormous, and
they made the fortunes of many, and perhaps of most of those
connected with it. Who, then, constituted the Credit Mobilier?
It was but another name for the Pacific Railroad ring.
The members of it were in Congress; they were trustees for
the bondholders, they were directors, they were stockholders,
they were contractors; in Washington they voted the subsidies,
in New York they received them, upon the Plains they
expended them, and in the _Credit Mobilier_ they divided them.
Ever-shifting characters, they were ubiquitous, --- now engineering
a bill, and now a bridge, --- they received money into
one hand as a corporation, and paid it into the other as a
contractor. As stockholders they owned the road, as mortgagees
they had a lien upon it, as directors they contracted
for its construction, and as members of the _Credit Mobilier_
they built it. What is the community to pay for it?

At the close of 1870, with $103,000,000 of their capital yet
unsubscribed, and thus reserved for issue, should the earnings
of the roads at any future period make watering practicable;
with this amount of stock in reserve, the two companies operated
2,083 miles of road, represented by stock and debt to the
amount of $240,000,000. Thus the last results of Vanderbilt's
genius have been surpassed at the very outset of this
enterprise. The line from Chicago to New York represents
now but $60,000 to the mile, as the result of many years
of inflation, while the line between Omaha and Sacramento
begins life with the cost of $115,000 per mile. It would
be safe to say that the road cost in money considerably less
than one half of this sum. The difference is the price paid
for every vicious element of railroad construction and management;
costly construction, entailing future taxation on
trade; tens of millions of fictitious capital; a road built on
the sale of its bonds, and with the aid of subsidies; every
element of real outlay recklessly exaggerated, and the whole at
some future day is to make itself felt as a burden on the trade
which it is to create.

Enough has been said to illustrate the bearing which stockwatering
and extravagant construction have upon taxation.
It would be useless to attempt to estimate the weight of the
burden imposed through these means upon material development.
The statistics which should enter into any reliable
estimate are not accessible, and any approximation would be
simply a matter of guess-work. A table was published, during
the year 1869, in a leading financial organ,[^/409] comparing
the capital stocks of twenty-eight roads as they stood on July
1, 1867, and May 1, 1869. During those twenty-two months
it was found that the total had increased from $287,036,000
to $400,684,000, or 40%. Carrying the comparison
on nine of these roads back two years further, it was found
that, in less than four years, their capitals had increased from
less than $ 84,000,000 to over $ 208,000,000, or 150%.
A portion of this, perhaps 25% of the whole, represents
private capital actually paid in and expended; another portion,
perhaps equally large, represents dividends the payment
of which was foregone and the money applied to construction;
the whole of the remainder may be set down as pure, unadulterated
"water," which calls for an annual tax-levy of
some three or four millions a year.

There is, however, another and very important side to this
question. What may be called the wrongs of the community
and the exactions of the capitalist have alone been discussed
hitherto. It now remains to consider the subject from the
capitalist point of view. Almost every balance-sheet presents
items of loss as well as of profit; --- that relating to railroads
is no exception to this rule. It has been noticed that the
laws which limited the profit on capital paid into railroad construction
made no provision to guarantee any profit up to
that limit. In regard to this the capitalist took his risk. He
built railroads in every direction, and the community undertook
to say to him that, where he made a success he must
content himself with reasonable profits; --- where he made a
failure he must submit to a total loss. Here, then, in this
absence of a guarantee of reasonable profit, lay the real
security which the community saw fit to take for itself against
excessive profit. It was a case of resort had to the doctrine of
averages. That it was no meaningless security is a thing very
susceptible of proof; --- indeed, it is not too much to say that
the loss incurred by private capital in ill-considered railroad
enterprises,--- the mere amounts of money actually paid into
construction, and since wiped out of existence by insolvency
or loss of interest, --- it is safe to say that this often forgotten
element in the account would constitute more than a set off
for the largest amount of watered stock ever alleged to have
been issued. People continually refer to the brilliant successes
in railroad enterprises; --- they do not so often count the
failures, or remember the fact that not a few of our thoroughfares
were actually given by capitalists to the communities
which now enjoy them. This statement is very susceptible of
proof. The profits upon railroad enterprises, as a whole, are not
excessive, --- the business is one which affords in this country
even less than the average return upon the capital invested in
it. The actual cost in money, up to the present time, of the
55,000 miles of railroad now in operation in the United States
cannot have been less than $ 40,000 per mile, or, in all, twentytwo
hundred millions of dollars, and was probably much more.
Perhaps one quarter in amount of the cost to both sides of
the war of the rebellion. The net earnings of the system,---
that part which alone represents profit on capital, --- cannot certainly
be estimated at more than 33% of the gross
earnings, or in this case $150,000,000 per annum. Here,
then, under the most favorable circumstances, is a system returning
6.82% upon the capital actually invested in it.
In America this cannot surely be considered excessive ; --- had
the State governments guaranteed the investments the money
could not have been obtained at a lower rate.


[^/409]: The Commercial and Financial Chronicle of May 15, 1869.

An examination of the system in detail would indicate a
similar result. In Massachusetts, the net earnings average
7.26% on the construction accounts of the roads; in
New York, they average 7.5%; but in Ohio they fall
to 4.8%; while in Pennsylvania they rise to 8.3%. Such facts as these would seem to indicate many and
very heavy counterbalancing losses. Nor are such difficult to
find. Beginning with the Grand Trunk in Maine, and passing
down by the Vermont Central to the Boston, Hartford & Erie
in Massachusetts, and thence to the Erie in New York, and the
Philadelphia & Erie in Pennsylvania, and the Atlantic & Great
Western in Ohio, and so on by the Ohio & Mississippi to the
North Missouri, it is not difficult to enumerate name after
name, representing thousands of miles of roads and hundreds
of millions of investment, which are synonymous only with
loss and insolvency, or at best with hopes long deferred.

It is in this way that a certain just, though rude average is
evolved out of a conflict of shrewdness and simplicity, excessive
cunning and unreasoned action. The difficulty with
averages is, however, an obvious one. The burden is necessarily
to be placed just where the public interest demands that
it should not be placed. A thoroughfare like the New York
Central makes good the deficiencies of a number of local enterprises
which have no connection with it. It is thus on the
chief arteries that the greatest obstruction is placed, and the
transportation tax is to be levied indefinitely wherever it can
most readily be found. The mere fact that a sort of average
is educed is no alleviation of particular ills complained of.
Each road is constructed on its own merits, and without regard
to the profit or loss involved in the operation of another road
perhaps hundreds of miles off. That the through routes of
the country, --- the main arteries of travel and commerce
should ultimately be as nearly as possible free, is of the greatest
moment to the whole American people; that they should
ever become so under a system which causes them to make
good the deficiencies of an entire system, is to the last degree
improbable. The true rule would seem to be, that, while the
owners have a right to the stipulated return on the cost of
their whole property, whether the same was paid in by them
in money or in undivided profits within the limit of dividends,
yet that beyond this the community ought resolutely to insist
that every increase of value should contribute only to the
freedom of intercourse.

In conclusion, the practical remedy of the abuse of stockwatering
in its most objectionable shape would after all seem
to be both obvious and easily to be secured. There has never
been in America any recognized and uniform mode of keeping
railroad accounts. The want of this has opened the door to
all the evils, not fraudulent, which have been described. A
very brief statement of the case will make this apparent.
All railroad expenditures are incurred either on account of
the construction or of the operation of roads. Construction
should properly represent cash paid in by stockholders, upon
the full amount of which they have a right to receive dividends,
if the earnings justify their payment; the operation of
the road, on the other hand, is to be fully provided for out
of the earnings, and it is only the balance left over after thus
providing for it which can be devoted to the payment of
dividends. No method of keeping these accounts having been
prescribed by government, as a consequence no two corporations
have kept them alike. Certain corporations early closed
their construction accounts, and consequently the whole cost
of developing their roads was afterwards charged to operating
expenses. In such cases the community simply doubled and
trebled its railroad facilities out of an excessive transportation
tax. In other words, instead of paying an annual interest on
capital invested in railroads, it pays in the capital itself, thus
gradually accumulating a property out of all proportion to the
evidences of value which represent it in private hands. This
is what is known as a conservative system of management.
On the other hand, another system of management charges all
doubtful amounts to construction, thus perhaps running the
company in debt, but at the same time reducing operating
expenses to a minimum and nominally leaving heavy net
profits to furnish dividends to the stockholders. The result
of this system is that the securities of a road rapidly reach an
amount which more than represents the full value of the .
property. This is what is not infrequently known as a progressive
or enterprising management. In each extreme the
public is practically defrauded.

So long as this license in railroad accounts is permitted it is
impossible for any community to do more than guess at the
real amount of paid-in capital represented by its railroad system.
On the one hand the proceeds of the transportation tax
are habitually perverted to the work of construction; and,
upon the other hand, the private capital which should do the
work of construction is applied to the payment of dividends.
The responsibility of fixing the cost of their thoroughfares is
thus devolved upon the private corporations which own them.
That such a power should be abused is almost inevitable; that
it now does exist and always has existed is a striking evidence
of legislative improvidence. A public and uniform system of
railroad accounts, kept in a manner specified by government,
and audited by government officials, would have obviated
much of the difficulty and prevented innumerable frauds.
Finally, a responsible department of the executive should
have charge of the subject and should be empowered to decide
as to the amounts of private capital, directly or indirectly
paid into construction, and authorize the issue of securities
accordingly.

## The Government and the Railroad Corporations

If neither competition nor legislation have proved themselves
effective agents for the regulation of the railroad
system what other and more effective one is there within the
reach of the American people? This is the final issue to
which the railroad problem must apparently reduce itself.
The material and moral difficulties which surround the question
are further complicated by grave political considerations,
which need now to be stated with all possible emphasis, for
they will continually present themselves throughout what
remains of this discussion, and must ever be borne in mind.
The difficulty in great degree arises from the development of
a material and moral power, or rather, perhaps, combination
of powers, in our social organism which our political system
was not calculated to deal with. At the time the framework
of our government was put together, a system of necessary
monopolies was the very last thing which was expected to present
itself on this continent. Our governments, state and
national, grew up among, and were calculated for, a community
in the less complex stages of civilization. Our whole
machinery looked to dealing with individuals, and that only in
the least degree which deserved the name of government at
all. The idea of one man or set of men combining to own
in absolute monopoly the great channels of internal communication
as they then existed, --- the Hudson, or the Ohio, or
the great lakes, --- would have been regarded as a wholly inadmissible
supposition, a contingency impossible to occur. Consequently
no machinery was devised calculated to meet such
an improbable emergency. Yet that very emergency would
now seem to be imminent. Here then are two systems growing
and expanding side by side, --- the representative, republican
system of government, adapted to a simple and somewhat
undeveloped phase of society; and the corporate industrial
system, the result and concomitant of a complex and
artificial civilization. How long can they develop together?
The peculiarities and combinations now noticed in our legislatures
and market-places, the growing torpidity of public
opinion, the constant strain under which our machinery of
government visibly works, the crude, undigested propositions
for reform which emanate from every quarter, the startling
rapidity with which change develops itself, and the rapidly
shifting phases which all interests assume, clearly indicate
some deep-seated social and political revolution in progress.
What this will result in, time only can disclose. It would
be a mere waste of space and ingenuity to endeavor to forecast
it at present.

Meanwhile so far as the railroad system is concerned it
seems almost inevitable that the national government must,
soon or late, and in a greater or less degree, assume a jurisdiction.
This is an obvious conclusion to be deduced from the
irresistible development of the system in a course it has hitherto
pursued. The next question is when, and in what way,
and to what extent, is this to be done? What is to be the
basis of legislation? This now admits of almost infinite modification,
ranging from public ownership on the one hand, to
the most limited regulation on the other. The same may be
said as to extent of jurisdiction. It may be assumed over all
roads lying in more than one State, or it may be confined to
certain trunk lines specially designated as military and post
roads. These questions it is now premature to discuss. They
constitute the final problem. All other proposed solutions of
it, resting upon State regulation or State control, are but
temporizing expedients, important simply as illustrating the
practical value of certain theories. Such may prove instructive
resting-places; they can hardly be the final objective. To
these, however, attention should now be confined, for through
them the ultimate results are to be evolved.

Two of these proposed solutions have of late excited an unusual
degree of discussion. The one seeks to supply our government
with a supplementary power, which will better adapt
it to the new exigency which it is called upon to meet; --- the
other directly meets the emergency with a proposal of some
form of ownership of railroads by the State; it pronounces the
English and American railroad system in many respects a
failure, and seeks to make good its defects by the introduction
into it of certain features of the Belgian system.

It is impossible, in view of past experience, not to entertain
grave doubts as to the result of any experiment of the sort last
referred to, made through the political machinery which exists
in America. As regards the construction of a railroad system
it has repeatedly been tried and uniformly ended in failure.
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, and many other States
went through the same sad experience. Every section with us
had its claims, and those claims could not be disregarded.
In Belgium, in France, or in Russia a government engineer
can locate a railway, and there an end; it was found to be
otherwise in America, and an impartial disregard of the figures
of the census by no means resulted in a commercial success.
It is, however, argued that it would be otherwise in the case
of a completed system; that if our State governments could
not construct, they could at least manage railroads by deputy.
This remains to be seen. That the government should engage
in any business, whether as producers, as carriers, as bankers,
or as manufacturers, is opposed to the whole theory of strictly
limited governmental functions.

This aspect of the question is most important, and in America
it cannot well be dwelt upon too frequently or stated too
broadly. Our whole political organization, our history as a
nation, the prodigious material development of which we are
so vain, --- all of these rest upon the great principle of limited
governmental functions, and the leaving of persons and interests
to rely solely on themselves, and to work out their own destiny
in their own way, subject to the least possible external interference.
To turn over to a government constructed on such
a principle the management of so complex an organization as
the railroad system is certainly a measure of the last resort.
But, unfortunately, this is a case in which choice must be
made between two evils. So far from disentangling themselves
from connection with the railroad system, there is not to-day
a government in the United States, including the national
government itself, which is not steadily drifting into the most
dangerous form of connection with it of which it is possible
to conceive. It is scarcely an exaggeration to say that our
legislatures are now universally becoming a species of irregular
boards of railroad direction. Questions of the purest
detail affecting the operation of railroads are regularly brought
before them, and the increasing disposition to manage this
elaborate system by statute enactment is notorious. Not only
is it more than questionable whether this can be successfully
done, but the attempt itself irresistibly forces the owners of
the system in self-defence into the lobby. The inevitable consequence
does not need to be dwelt upon; it has already become
a fruitful source of scandal and alarm. The question at
issue, therefore, is not between interference and non-interference
by the State, but between two forms of interference.

For, indeed, it is practically conceded on all sides that the
task of supervising in some way the railroads of a modern
State does constitute one of the necessary functions of government.
A writer as jealous of limiting those functions as
J. S. Mill expressly makes this exception: "There are many
cases in which the agency, of whatever nature, by which a
service is performed, is certain from the nature of the case, to
be virtually single, in which a practical monopoly, with all the
power it confers of taxing the community, cannot be prevented
from existing. ... it is the part of government either to subject
this service to reasonable conditions for the general advantage,
or to retain such power over it, that the profits of
the monopoly may at least be obtained for the public. This
applies to the case of a road, a canal, or a railway. These are
always in a great degree practical monopolies; and a government
which concedes such monopolies unreservedly to a private
company, does much the same thing as if it allowed an individual
or an association to levy any tax they chose, for their
own benefit, on all the malt produced in the country, or on all
the coffee imported into it." Accepting this statement of the
case as sound, and it is difficult to see how it can be controverted,
it simply remains to consider what form of interference
will be most effective, and at the same time in the least degree
politically injurious. At this point opinions diverge.

The results of legislative regulation of private railroad corporations
have been sufficiently dwelt upon. It can hardly be
claimed that in any aspect they have been encouraging. Not
only have the material interests of the community suffered,
but the effects upon political morality have been injurious,
and are felt at the most vital point of our system, --- in the
legislative department. A vicious civil service or an inefficient
executive can be reformed, but there is no power which can
purify a corrupted legislature. Many States in this country,
and especially New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and
Maryland have now for years notoriously been controlled by
their railroad corporations. Not one of these States owns a
mile of railroad, and yet it is very difficult to conceive of any
form of State ownership which would entail greater scandals
or political evils than those which now spring from the system
in use in them. The empty name of non-interference is thus
jealously guarded, while constant interference notoriously constitutes
one half of the legislative business of the country.

The expediency of making an experiment at the State
ownership of a railway and its management through the
agency of public trustees, instead of a board of private directors,
has been more or less discussed during each of the
last three sessions of the Massachusetts legislature. A fair
though carefully limited trial of the Belgian system was proposed
by the Board of Railroad Commissioners of the State
in their report for 1871. They advocated the purchase by the
Commonwealth of the fifty miles of road between Boston
and Fitchburg, which will ultimately connect with the West
by means of the Hoosac Tunnel. The argument of the Commissioners
practically was, that competition, if it could be
secured, was, under the present circumstances, the most effective
agent which could be brought to bear to introduce many
greatly needed reforms into the Massachusetts railway system.
To effect these reforms by means of legislation in the case of
roads owned and managed by private companies, even if it
were practicable, would in fact occasion a far more dangerous
and corrupting political association between the private companies
and the government, than the absolute ownership of
any experimental line. Such a line once in the hands of
trustees, and energetically managed, would obviate all necessity
of further attempts at the most difficult class of railroad legislation
by effecting that through the force of competition,
which it was now in vain sought to compel by law. The competition
and comparison continually existing between the public
and private lines could be relied upon to keep the administration
of each pure; neither, it was argued, would the State
in this way be gradually led on to assume the other railroads
within its limits. If public management failed to operate the
one road assumed so as to compete with private roads, and in
addition thereto to pay the interest on its purchase money,---
equal to the dividends on private roads,--- then other portions
of the State would insist upon the sale of the property
rather than pay taxes to support a local public road; did public
management succeed in its reforms and still meet all demands
on account of interest, then private managements
would, under the pressure of public opinion, naturally adopt
reforms thus proved to be safe; they would follow in the
beaten track.

The only cases furnished by American experience at all
parallel to the one here proposed, certainly do not militate
against this line of argument. Most prominent is that of the
Erie Canal in New York. The influence of this canal as an
independent and steady competing force upon railroads is
well known; --- it, and it only, can be relied upon never to
enter either into freight combinations or ruinous competition.
It has been public property, and its management certainly has
not been above criticism, but it is equally indisputable that it
has never exercised upon the politics of New York an influence
either so great or so pernicious as at least two of the private
railroad corporations with which it competes. So far as
administration is concerned, the precedent of the Erie Canal
wholly fails. The service in the case of a canal and a railroad
being dissimilar, the element of comparison between the public
and the private roads which has produced such great results
in Belgium is wanting. One thing, however, is very certain,
and not less suggestive as bearing on one present phase
of the railroad problem, were the canal a public railway, instead
of what it is, Mr. Vanderbilt might safely be permitted
to water the stock of the Central to any degree which he
might desire; --- the community could always control the
tariff of his road without being compelled to resort to hostile
legislation. Neither would the influence of this competition
probably be confined to the Central road. Railroad management
in the same community always seeks a certain level;
reforms once introduced are never confined to their original
limits. Let a positive advance in any direction be thoroughly
established, and the pressure of self interest and popular feeling
may safely be relied upon to make it general.

The Post-Office Department of the United States government
also throws some light through its workings upon the
proposed innovation. The postal service is a close monopoly,
employing thousands of agents and entailing heavy expenditures;
--- it has for a long time been subjected to all the evils
which flow from a system of rotation in office, --- it is a recognized
part of the political spoils of the country. While, in
spite of these adverse circumstances, its administration will
probably compare favorably with that of any railroad in the
country, and while it furnishes facilities and accommodates the
public as no private corporation possibly could do, yet no
one will mantain that the Post-Office in its connection with
the government is politically either as disturbing or as corrupting
an agent as any one of numerous railroad corporations
which are perpetually soliciting Congress.

Should this experiment be tried and succeed it might well
give a new phase to the whole question of internal communication,
and bring the railroad problem one step nearer to a
solution. Meanwhile, it would be wholly futile to suppose in
the face of the growing tendency to nationality, the constantly
increasing disposition to ignore State lines and to transfer
control to the general government, that this revolution would
confine itself to State limits, or that a dozen different State
organizations could control a Pacific railway. Such a system,
with local jealousies, interests, and pride to contend with, ---
each great line running the gauntlet of a dozen rival competing
points, and artificially turned into twenty interested channels,
--- would so hamper the commerce of the continent that it would
crumble into chaos in less than a twelvemonth. Government
ownership of railroads can therefore with us only mean their
ultimate, though not necessarily exclusive, ownership by the
national government. At present, however, that government
is peculiarly unfitted to assume any functions of this sort,
and must continue to be so until after a thorough and sweeping
reform of the civil service is effected. A purified political
atmosphere may be imagined, in which at some future time it
would be safe for Congress to assume the management, through
supervising boards, of certain designated continental routes;
but any movement in that direction would certainly, and very
properly, encounter a strong and determined opposition so
long as the present condition of affairs exists.

It is not wholly impossible, however, that a safer, even if less
effective, solution of the difficulty may be found in the furnishing
our governments with the supplementary power which
shall adapt them to the new condition of affairs which has
arisen. A practical attempt in this direction is now in process
of development in Illinois. That State was the first to recognize
the essential fact that the railroad system is an exceptional
interest, and therefore requires to be exceptionally dealt with.
This great stride in advance was secured by the Constitution
of 1870. It was the concession of a starting-point, the recognition
of the new social and political force for which no provision
had been made. When a deficiency is fairly acknowledged,
we can in America feel a tolerable confidence that it
will shortly be supplied. The provisions introduced into the
Illinois Constitution are, indeed, crude and unsatisfactory, but
they are a beginning. A discussion of these provisions will
again bring into view at once the very point upon which our
State systems have hitherto broken down in their attempts to
deal with the railroad development.

The most striking feature of the Illinois Constitution is the
strong resolve of its framers to do away with what are known
in England as "private bills," and in this country as special
legislation. It is unnecessary to dilate upon the nature of
this abuse, which may safely be set down as the greatest danger
to which any system of government is liable; it may
almost be said to be the root of all political ills. Legislation
should know nothing of individuals. All modern thought
tends to the conclusion that the universe is controlled by general
laws; and a belief in special providences is entertained
only by the most superstitious. A sound system of government
should recognize individuals no more than the laws of
nature recognize them. The law should apply to all, without
discrimination for or against. The system of special legislation,
on the contrary, from top to bottom, is based on a supposed
necessity, which is taken for granted as existing, that
privileges may be conceded to one or a few which it is not safe
or politic to concede to all. Nature never acts in this way,
nor will thoroughly enlightened governments do so, when any
such exist. The Illinois Constitution deserves to be hailed as
a great advance towards the realization of this idea. The
framers of this instrument, when they came to dealing with
railways, provided for their regulation these articles, among
others:---

### Corporations

§ 1. "No corporation shall be created by special laws, or its charter
extended, changed, or amended; . . . but the General Assembly
shall provide, by general laws, for the organization of all corporations
hereafter to be created,"

§ 11. "No railroad corporation shall consolidate its stock, property,
or franchises with any other railroad corporation owning a
parallel or competing line. ..."

§ 12. "Railways heretofore constructed, or that may hereafter be
constructed, in this State, are hereby declared public highways, and
shall be free to all persons for the transportation of their property
thereon, under such regulations as may be prescribed by law. And
the General Assembly shall, from time to time, pass laws establishing
reasonable maximum rates of charges for the transportation of passengers
and freight on the different railroads in this State."

§ 13. "No railroad corporation shall issue any stock or bonds,
except for money, labor, or property, actually received and applied
to the purposes for which such corporation was created; and all
stock dividends and other fictitious increase of the capital stock or
indebtedness of any such corporation shall be void. ..."

§ 15. "The General Assembly shall pass laws to correct abuses,
and prevent unjust discrimination and extortion in the rates of
freight and passenger tariffs on the different railroads in this State,
and enforce such laws by adequate penalties, to the extent, if necessary
for that purpose, of forfeiture of their property and franchises."

Now while it is conceded that special legislation is the
bane of all government, it must also be conceded that special
legislation has hitherto been found indispensable to any regulation
of the railroad system. The exception once conceded,
every railroad came up and demanded it own special immunities
and privileges, --- its peculiar charter, which was a law
unto itself. The extent to which this was carried may be inferred
from the three thousand two hundred acts on the
statute-book of Great Britain, and the one thousand on that
of Massachusetts, --- nine-tenths of them, in each case, special
legislation to meet the supposed requirements of an organized
monopoly. The exception and its dangerous nature --- the
frauds which were perpetrated under it, and the lax and confused
system of legislation it was engendering --- long ago
attracted the public attention and excited its alarm. The
press raised its voice, and the people responded by inserting
into more than one constitution provisions absolutely inhibiting
the passage of any act of a private nature. In other States
the Executive accepted the issue; and in New York a long
succession of vetoes has only recently vindicated the principle
of general legislation. There was in each of these efforts at
reform an element of fatal weakness. The fact that the railroad
system occupied an exceptional position was ignored.
Instead of conceding that this system was made up of a number
of monopolies, in regard to the necessities of which a discretion
must be exercised, journalists and legislators insisted
on placing them in a position exactly similar to that of individuals,
amenable to every law of trade. The result was,
of course, failure. The monopolies evaded or broke down the
law, and were omnipresent in legislatures. There was no
machinery in the government adapted to meeting the exceptional
case. Reformers failed to realize that, though special
legislation was corrupting the whole political system, yet
general legislation of the ordinary description would not meet
the requirements of the case. It is here that the whole question
lies in a nutshell, --- how can the requirements of the
railroad system be met, and yet its individual members driven
from the legislature?

This final result was not attained in the Illinois Constitution;
had it been, the value of that instrument would have
been more than doubled. Indeed, the provision made in it
brings the innovator just to the fatal point; as yet he has
done nothing, but the next step involves everything. In spite
of its Constitution, Illinois must now slip back into the deep
mire of special railroad legislation, or it must go on and solve
the problem. The case stands thus: the Constitution implies
the passage of (1) laws prescribing reasonable rates of charges
on the different railroads, and (2) laws to correct abuses and
prevent unjust discrimination and extortion in the rates of
freight and passenger tariff.

The legislature it seems is to do this work; if so, the work
cannot be done; the provision is so much waste paper. It
may boldly be laid down as a principle, that no general law
can be framed which will meet the exigencies of a whole railroad
system in all its manifold details. This is true in almost
every respect. A law, for instance, authorizes the taking of
land for railroad purposes, but one road requires an exceptional
amount of land in a particular locality. A general law
regulates station facilities; but while it may apply well to one
district, it will be simply ridiculous in its application to
another. The difficulties in the way of framing a general law
regulating fairs and freights, --- the very one provided for in
the Illinois Constitution, have already been sufficiently discussed.
If, turning from this manifest difficulty, the legislature
seeks to establish tariffs adapted to particular roads, then
the whole evil of special legislation in its worst possible form
is upon it. Where, then, is the escape?

We have thus got back to the old puzzle, --- how to meet
special requirements under general laws. The solution, if
found at all, --- if failure is not predestined, --- will be found
by the Illinois legislature in fairly recognizing an evident exception
to general conditions, and supplying an executory power
specially calculated to meet it. It is the want of this which
has brought to nought all efforts at general legislation on this
subject up to this time. They have uniformly failed from one
defect; they were hard, unyielding, intended to apply to differently
conditioned members of one exceptional and most complex
system, and yet wholly unprovided with any discretionary,
adaptive, or executory power. The law was there, but it did
not move. It was as if a criminal law were put upon the
statute-book which was to apply to all degrees of crime indiscriminately,
without the aid of judge or of officer. And, indeed,
this very example illustrates the whole subject. The
criminal law was once a subject of special legislation. Individual
criminals had acts passed to meet their particular
cases. The legislature was at one and the same time judge
and jury. The legislative and judicial functions of government
were, however, separated so long ago, that the community
has forgotten that they were ever united; yet it
was this division, first introduced under Alfred the Great,
which alone made possible the success of parliamentary government.
Had it been the discovery of one man, he who
made it would have deserved to rank among the greatest
benefactors of his kind. In early New England history the
distinction was again obliterated. The Great and General
Court was in Massachusetts Bay both the source of law and
the seat of supreme justice. This simplicity very shortly dis
appeared as society became more complex, but it left behind it
the fatal legacy of special legislation. The same confusion of
functions is exactly what has hitherto existed in regard to railroads;
the result, both in New and Old England, is seen in a
statute-book swollen with special enactments, a legislature
overwhelmed with business it cannot do and tainted with
jobbery of which it cannot rid itself, all resulting in a railroad
system which is a confessed failure in everything but its
material aspect, with which the legislature could have nothing
to do. Can the desired separation be effected?

The solution of the problem stated in this form seems so
obvious, that it is fairly matter of surprise that it has never
yet been practically attempted. The legislature should enact
its general laws for the requirements of railroads, as it does
to meet the innumerable civil and criminal complications which
arise; but, in the one case as in the other, the judicial and
discretionary action under the general law should be devolved
upon tribunals specially created to take cognizance of them.
The legislature declares the rule which is the same to all;
but the degrees of discretion which varying circumstances exact
in the application of the rule must constitute a trust necessarily
delegated to others. At present all these distinct powers
are jealously retained by the legislatures. Their committees
sit as courts and take evidence and listen to arguments. So
far it is well. At this point, however, instead of framing a
general law or dismissing the individual case, they undertake
to give a charter to this applicant and to refuse it to that; to
pass a special act in favor of this corporation, and to reject it
as regards that; to authorize an increase of stock here, and to
direct the construction of a new depot there. These are functions
which no legislative body can successfully perform; as
well undertake to decide every suit at law or to affix the penalty
to every crime. Just so long as legislatures insist on
themselves doing work of this nature, just so long will corruption
increase and the statute-book fall into confusion.

But it will be said, Who will guard the virtue of the tribunal?
Why should the corporations not deal with them as
with the legislatures? They may do so, but somewhere and
at some point, put on all the checks and balances that human
ingenuity can devise, we must come back and rely on human
honesty at last. One rule always holds good,--- where the
most direct responsibility exists, there will the best conduct
be found. Corruption loves a throng and shrinks from isolated
places. To divide responsibility is to destroy it. The
judges of our courts are rarely otherwise than pure; the
heads of our official departments are conspicuous for honesty;
they are always directly and individually responsible. If we
thus can, and indeed, from the necessity of the case, must
confide the charge of the public funds and our personal liberties
to mortals like ourselves, acting under the law, it is difficult
to see why, except that we never have done so, we cannot
trust these other interests to similar mortals. All in such
cases depends upon the men. We have had in England and in
this country a sufficiency of feeble attempts in this direction ---
boards of trade, railroad commissions, and various other
pieces of machinery. They have all failed, for one reason,---
the principle of special legislation was ever kept open in the
background behind them. They have uniformly possessed a
mere simulacrum of power; their decisions were appealed
from, their recommendations were ignored, and their principal
duty was to sit patiently by and watch the corporations as
they dealt directly with the legislature over their heads.
Instead of the legislature saying to the sturdy corporation
beggars who infested the lobby, as it would say to civil litigants
or to criminals, "Leave us! there is the general law
and there is a tribunal specially charged with the interests of
you monopolists; go to it!" --- instead of this, the boards,
commissions, and what not, have ever been placed in the ignominious
position of a court, whether civil or criminal, from
which in every case an appeal would lie to the legislature itself.
A tribunal so constituted can hardly fail, soon or late,
to sink into contempt; least of all is it calculated to deal with
powerful corporations. As a direct consequence of this conspicuous
distrust, these tribunals have almost invariably been
made up of very inferior and, not seldom, corrupt men, for no
such responsibility and prominence was thrown upon them as
forced out capacity and integrity as the only alternative to
failure. Had the same class of appointees, as a rule, been
placed upon the bench, the judiciary would long since have
sunk into contempt. The duties, the responsibilities, and the
characters of those composing these boards should, on the
contrary, be brought up to the highest standard, --- to an
equality, in short, with those of the judges of our courts.
Their tribunals should be clothed with all necessary powers
and be put forward as if the members were fully competent to
represent the interests of the State with an experience and
ability, a knowledge of details, and a zeal in their occupation
equal to that ever so conspicuously displayed by the agents
of the corporations. Such men could certainly be found;
the corporations always have them. Meanwhile the whole
subject may be summed up in few words: under a system
which permits special legislation, boards for the regulation of
railroads are useless; they are, however, indispensable under
one which confines itself to general laws.

It is not impossible that the defective machinery in our
government, to use once more the simile originally employed
at the beginning of this chapter, may be strengthened in the
way indicated. A new strain has been brought to bear. At
present our government occupies the impossible position of
a wooden liner exposed to the fire of modern artillery. It
was built for no such trial. The railroad corporations, necessarily
monopolists, constitute a privileged class living under a
form of government intended to inhibit all class legislation.
We must, then, see our government fail in this unexpected
crisis, or we must strengthen it in such a manner as to enable
it to vindicate its authority. This can only be done through
human agency; ingenious statute machinery, without a man
inside of it, will only result in certain failure. The other
course, also, may fail, as the iron plates of our monitors may
be crushed by the weight of novel projectiles; but here, at
least, the power of resistance can in some degree be proportioned
to the intensity of the strain.

The only advance which has for years been made in
railroad legislation was effected in the direction indicated by
the legislature of Illinois in the first session after the adoption
of the new constitution. Amid some legislation of very questionable
character and propriety, and which can hardly fail injuriously
to react upon the reform desired, two laws were
enacted of great importance; --- by one a board of commissioners
was constituted, and by the other a general attempt
was made to classify roads and to affix limits to the charges for
travel. It is extremely improbable that the last act will be
found perfect in its provisions, but it contains in itself the
two great germs from which an efficient regulation of roads by
law must grow if the thing is in any way possible; --- these
two germs are the recognition of the natural differences between
different railroad enterprises, and the consequent delegation
of a discretion in details and administration to a permanent
and competent tribunal.
