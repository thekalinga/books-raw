_History of the Legal-Tender Paper Money issued during the

CHIEF JUSTICE CHASE, on the 7th of February, 1870, in re:gard
to the Construction of the Legal-Tender Act._

\ 

During the Rebellion the United States armies suffered
many disasters in the field, which for the moment were
felt as direct and personal misfortunes by every loyal citizen.
So strong was the public feeling of anger and astonishment,
that Congress appointed committees of investigation, to examine
into the causes of these military failures, and subjected the
whole conduct of the war to a searching and sometimes a severe
criticism. In finance, on the other hand, the nation suffered
only one great disaster, but its effects have extended far
beyond the period of the war, and are likely to be felt with
unmitigated force for an indefinite time yet to come. The
causes of this catastrophe have not been investigated by Congress;
but as the day may probably arrive when the national
government will have been forced to accept the fact that the
act of national bankruptcy was a calamity so terrible as to involve
the personal and political credit of every man in whose
charge the people had then placed the common interests, it
may be useful to point out the path which the future congressional
committee on the Conduct of the Finances will be compelled
to follow in investigating the causes which led to that
miscarriage, the results of which have far exceeded in importance
the defeat of any of the national armies or the failure of
any campaign. The timid and hesitating criticism with which
the subject has been commonly treated speaks ill for the sound
sense of the community. The public has so thoroughly adopted
the idea that it is itself the responsible governing power, and
its representatives only delegates to enroll its orders, that the
healthy process of criticising a policy once adopted seems to
it almost an attack on its own authority. The confusion of
ideas involved in this assumption of responsibility is peculiarly
unfortunate. The task of citizens who are selected to govern
is one thing. They bear the burden of leaders, and they enjoy
the honor. They are, too, at liberty to excuse or palliate
their mistakes, their ignorance, or their crimes by whatever
argument they can make to answer their purpose. But the
task of the public is wholly different. It is that of insisting,
without favor or prejudice, on the observance of truth in legislation
and in the execution of the laws. To apply the principles
of truth in criticism is the first duty of every writer for
the press and every speaker on the hustings. Whatever seems
harsh in criticism or vehement in temper may be excused in
the citizen who clings to the rigid logic of fundamental principles,
and who leaves to those whose public conduct fails to
reach his standard, the labor of justifying themselves in the
best way they can.


[^/301]: From the North American Review for April, 1870.

It is customary, however, for critics of American finance to
begin at this point with the assumption that the Legal-Tender
Act was necessary and inevitable. As a matter of criticism,
nothing can be more absurd than such a beginning; and as a
matter of intelligence, nothing can be feebler. Congress and
the country permitted no such assumption to be made in excuse
for the beaten generals at Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville.
There can be no satisfactory conclusion from such a
premise. No sound result can be reached except by assuming
at the outset that the Legal-Tender Act was not necessary;
that the public was not responsible for it; that the men who
made it law were answerable to the people for their act, and
are bound to show that so extraordinary and so grave a misfortune
could, by no means, have been avoided. If they fail
to prove their case, they are condemned. It is, too, a matter
of the greatest consequence to decide what the ultimate judgment
will be, since on it must turn not only questions of the
most considerable material interests, but points of fundamental
law in the United States, and of the theory of government for
future time. The urgent necessity of establishing some fixed
principles in regard to this disease of debased currency may
be measured by the extent of the disease itself. Russia, Austria,
Turkey, Italy, Spain, Brazil, Japan, and an indefinite
number of smaller communities, besides the United States,
have, to-day, no fixed standard of value in domestic exchanges.
With rare exceptions, no government that has once debased its
standard has ever restored it, except through the desperate
resource of partial or entire repudiation. Unless the world is
prepared to agree that society has no protection, and that the
assumed progress of political science is a mere dream, there
can be no excuse for continuing to accept as inevitable an evil
which, in all times, has been merely the result of ignorance
and misgovernment.

The law of legal tender, passed by Congress in February,
1862, cannot, therefore, be assumed to have been necessary,
and its supporters are bound to prove that they had no alternative.
To this task Mr. Spaulding, the principal author of
the measure, has applied himself; while, on the other hand,
Mr. Chase, without whose assent the law could not have
passed, has assumed the contrary ground. There is, unfortunately,
at the outset a strong presumption against the law,
rising from the unquestionable fact that the men who, in 1862,
were charged with the conduct of the finances, and were responsible
for this law in particular, had no claim to confidence.
on the ground of their financial knowledge or experience.
Something better might indeed have been expected among a
people so devoted to commerce and so habituated to self-government.
Military disasters were to be looked for, seeing that
the nation had no training nor taste for war; but though war,
or art, or philosophy, or abstract knowledge, were beyond the
range of public or popular interest, an experience of two hundred
years ought at least to have insured the country against
mistakes in practical politics. Such, however, was very far
from the truth. Among the leading statesmen then charged
with responsibility, not one was, by training, well fitted to
perform the duties of finance minister, or to guide the financial
opinions of Congress. The Secretary of the Treasury,
certainly the most capable of the men then connected with
finance, suffered severely under the disadvantage of inexperience.
In the Senate, finance, like every other subject, was
treated rather as though it were a branch of the common or
constitutional law, than as though it were a system with
established principles and processes of its own. But it was
in the House of Representatives that the want of education
was most apparent and most mischievous, while, by a significant
coincidence, it happens that the law of legal tender, more
than almost any other great financial measure of the Rebellion,
was peculiarly and essentially the work of this House.
As for the members who originated and whose activity carried
through all opposition the act of February, 1862, it is difficult
to characterize them in language which would not seem unduly
and unreasonably severe. Yet it may honestly be
doubted whether there has ever been a time since Kleon, the
leather-seller, was sent by the people of Athens to command
its armies at Sphacteria and Amphipolis, and since Aristophanes
on the public stage covered the powerful popular leader with
an immortal ridicule which surely reflected most severely on
the Athenian people itself,--- it may honestly be doubted
whether history records an occasion when the interests of a
great country in an extreme emergency have been committed
to hands more eminently disqualified for the trust. In February,
1862, Mr. Thaddeus Stevens was chairman of the Committee
of Ways and Means, from which emanates the ordinary
financial legislation of Congress. To say that Mr. Stevens was
as little suited to direct the economical policy of the country
at a critical moment, as a naked Indian from the plains to
plan the architecture of St. Peter's or to direct the construction
of the Capitol, would express in no extreme language the
degree of his unfitness. That Mr. Stevens was grossly ignorant
upon all economical subjects and principles was the least
of his deficiencies. A dogmatic mind, a high temper, and an
overbearing will are three serious disqualifications for financial
success, especially when combined with contempt for financial
knowledge. It is no exaggeration to say, that every quality
of his nature and every incident of his life which gave Mr.
Stevens power in the House, where he was almost omnipotent
in the legislation which belonged to the war and to reconstruction,
conspired to unfit him for the deliberate and difficult
discussions of finance. But it is not to Mr. Stevens
that the principal burden of blame or praise for the financial
legislation of that momentous year is to be awarded. In the
press of business upon the committee, when in the brief
space of a few months the whole system of loans, of taxation,
and of currency, demanded by a war of such tremendous
proportions, had to be created, so to speak, out of nothing,
two sub-committees were formed to divide the duties which
fell upon the committee. One of these, under the lead of Mr.
Morrill of Vermont, undertook to enlarge and adjust the
scheme of taxation to the new necessities of the government.
The other, under the chairmanship of the Hon. Elbridge G.
Spaulding of New York, assumed the care of the national currency,
the raising of loans, and the issue of treasury notes or
bonds. Mr. Stevens remained chairman of the whole committee,
charging himself particularly with the matter of appropriations,
and lending his powerful voice to both sections below
him, as either by turn _encountered_ opposition in forcing
its measures through the House.

The intellect of a Congressman, gifted with no more than
the ordinary abilities of his class, is scarcely an interesting or
instructive subject of study; nor are the discussions that arise
among such men likely to be rich in stores of knowledge or
experience. But when an accidental representative is able to
carry "over the administration and through Congress,[^/308] as
Mr. Spaulding claims to have done, and as it is clear that Mr.
Spaulding did, a measure of such far-reaching consequences as
the Legal-Tender Act of 1862, the character of that person's
mind and the facts of his life cease to be matters of insignificance.
One may well inquire what sort of a man it was that
could lead a nation so far astray, and what the condition of
things that made it possible to effect results of such magnitude.
Financiers who make an addition of hundreds of
millions of dollars to the debts of their countries, representing
not a penny of value enjoyed, are entitled to a place in
history, whether they boast the intellectual capacity of Mr.
Pitt or of Mr. Spaulding.

Unlike Mr. Stevens, Mr. Spaulding had the advantage or
disadvantage of a certain sort of financial experience. He had
been for a time treasurer of the State of New York. By profession
he was, in 1862, president of a joint-stock bank at
Buffalo, and it was on this circumstance that he based his
chief claim to speak as an expert in finance. At the conference
on the 11th of January, 1862, at the treasury, between
the Secretary, the committees of Congress, and the representatives
of the principal Northern banks,--- a conference whose
momentous importance will require close attention, --- Mr.
Spaulding expressed his convictions both "as a banker and
legislator." The association of functions was not unimportant,
and Mr. Spaulding was right in laying stress upon it. Had he
not been a banker as well as a legislator, the Legal-Tender Act
might, it is not improbable, never have been enacted. Being
a provincial banker, and at the same time chairman of a subcommittee
dealing with the nominally financial but really
universal interests of thirty millions or more of citizens, and
dealing, too, with the whole future of a nation whose developraent
no bounds seem to limit, Mr. Spaulding naturally proceeded
to apply to the necessities of the situation the principles
of finance which he had learned in shaving notes at a
country bank.


[^/308]: Mr. Spaulding's share in the passage of the Bill is described in these words
by his colleague, Hon. T. M. Pomeroy, in a speech delivered in the House of
Representatives on the 19th February, 1862.

These necessities were unquestionably serious, but few persons
now retain any distinct recollection of their actual shape.
To the minds of men living in 1870 the events of 1862 appear
bound up in close connection with the long series of events
that have intervened. The necessity of the Legal-Tender Act
is now assumed, not on account of what had happened before
the law was passed, nor on account of anything that was foreseen
by its authors, but because of what afterwards occurred,
the exigencies of a situation far more difficult and alarming
than existed at that earlier time. Against such a confusion
of ideas it is necessary that every candid man should be on
his guard. The vague, general notion that, sooner or later,
legal-tender paper was inevitable, is a part of the same loose
and slovenly popular criticism with which the whole subject
has been so habitually treated, and is scarcely worth comment;
but the actual circumstances under which Congress declared
the measure to be necessary are a matter of fact, and it is with
these that law, history, and political science have first of all
to deal.

Congress met on the 2d of December, 1861, and the Secretary
immediately set before it an account of the financial
situation, and his own scheme for supplying the wants of the
treasury. He required about $200,000,000, in addition to resources
already provided, in order to meet the demands of the
next half-year. His immediate necessity was for $100,000,000
within three months. He estimated that the debt would
reach $517,000,000 on the 1st of July, 1862, and that a year
later it would probably become $900,000,000. In fact it rose
to $1,100,000,000. A part of the heavy government expenses
were to be met by taxation; a part by the sale of
bonds; and for the rest Mr. Chase proposed the assumption
by the government of the bank circulation, amounting to some
$200,000,000, with a view not only of obtaining the money,
but of providing a sound currency on which to conduct the
war. The Secretary did not, in this connection, overlook the
possibility of resorting to a forced paper circulation, but "the
immeasurable evils of dishonored public faith and national
bankruptcy" deterred him from recommending the measure,
or rather obliged him to reject it as dangerous and unnecessary.

Thus, on the 1st of December, 1861, according to the Secretary
of the Treasury, no occasion existed for resorting even
to the moderate measure of issuing government paper at all,
except so far as concerned a possible guaranty to a new bank
eirculation. The idea of legal tender was expressly rejected.
The government believed itself able to meet its demands on
the basis of the bank circulation, provided Congress would
place the bank circulation on an available footing. Nothing,
however, was done by Congress towards supplying the wants
of the treasury, until, towards the end of December, Mr.
Spaulding began to draft a bill for establishing a national
banking currency. While preparing this draft, Mr. Spaulding,
"upon mature reflection, came to the conclusion that the bill
could not be passed and made available quick enough to meet
the crisis then pressing upon the government for money to
sustain the army and navy. He therefore drafted a legaltender
treasury note section." This was done about the 30th
December; and this was the origin of the measure destined
to have so vast and permanent an influence on the American
people. The "mature reflection" of Mr. Spaulding could discover
no other or better method of supplying a temporary
want of $100,000,000, than a resort to the last expedient
known to finance; what he himself calls a forced loan, made
in the first year of the war by means which were equivalent
to a debasement of the standard of value and a bankruptcy
of the government. It is scarcely necessary to add a comment
upon this simple statement. Any reader in the least
familiar with financial history must appreciate the extravagance
of Mr. Spaulding's assumption. That he acted with
perfect honesty and good intention no one will think it worth
while to dispute; but that he had the least conception of the
consequences of what he was doing, or that he grasped even in
a limited degree the principles of statesmanship, no unprejudiced
or cool observer could imagine. Like all ignorant men,
impatient of resistance or restraint, the moment he saw an
obstacle, he knew but one resource, that of a blind and reckless
appeal to force.

Mr. Spaulding then, "upon more mature consideration,"
converted this section into a separate bill, and laid it before
his committee. The committee, however, was by no means
unanimous in accepting Mr. Spaulding's views of necessity.
It is true, and it is an interesting fact, that the only doubt
entertained by Mr. Thaddeus Stevens was in regard to the constitutionality
of the law; and one is somewhat at a loss
whether most to wonder at the profound ignorance thus betrayed
or at the constitutional scruples which suggested
themselves to this veteran expunger of constitutions. But
though Mr. Stevens and one half the committee approved the
bill, the other half stood out firmly against it, and only as a
matter of courtesy allowed it to be reported to the House.

On the 7th of January, 1862, the bill was reported. It authorized
the issue of $100,000,000 in treasury notes, to be a
legal tender, and exchangeable on demand for six %
bonds. Public opinion at once became sharply divided on the
merits of the measure. Delegates from the Boards of Trade
and banks of the principal Northern cities appeared in Washington
to oppose the bill, and on the 11th of January these
gentlemen met the Secretary of the Treasury and the finance
committees of the Senate and House, at Mr. Chase's office in
the department. Here the whole financial policy of the government
was made a subject of discussion, and the two paths
between which the country was still at liberty to choose were
marked out with unmistakable precision. Mr. Spaulding, on
the one hand, insisted not only that his measure was the best,
but that it was the only means of raising the money required,
and he demanded to know what alternative could be suggested.
On the part of the bank committees Mr. James Gallatin of
New York, submitted a complete financial scheme, and, with
the plain common sense of a practical man, replied to Mr.
Spaulding's inquiry with the simple proposal that the government
should sell its bonds in the open market for what they
would bring, without limitation of price. To this suggestion
Mr. Spaulding made the following reponse :---

>The Sub-Committee of Ways and Means, through Mr. Spaulding,
objected to any and every form of 'shinning' by government through
Wall or State Streets, to begin with; objected to the knocking down
of government stocks to seventy-five or sixty cents on the dollar,
the inevitable result of throwing a new and large loan on the market
without limitation as to price; claimed for treasury notes as
much virtue of par value as the notes of banks which have suspended
specie payments, but which yet circulate in the trade of the North;
_and finished with firmly refusing to assent to any scheme which should
permit a speculation by brokers, bankers, and others in the government
securities, and particularly any scheme which should double the public
debt of the country, and double the expenses of the war, by damaging
the credit of the government_ to the extent of sending it to 'shin'
through the shaving-shops of New York, Boston, and Philadelphia.
He affirmed his conviction as a banker and legislator, that it was
the lawful policy as well as the manifest duty of the government, in
the present exigency, to legalize as tender its fifty millions issue of
demand treasury notes, authorized at the extra session in July last,
and to add to this stock of legal tender, immediately, one hundred
millions more. _He thought that this financial measure would carry
the country through the war, and save its credit and dignity._ At the
same time we should insist upon taxation abundantly ample to pay
the expenses of the government on a peace footing, and interest of
every dollar of the public obligation, and to give this generation a
clear show of a speedy liquidation of the public debt.

Before commenting further upon this speech, it is necessary
to mark with care the fact that, throughout the whole legaltender
contest in 1862, there was no question involved but
that of _resource_. The sum of one hundred million dollars was
wanted to carry on the government, and Mr. Spaulding closed
every mouth by asking how else the money could be raised,
since the banks could provide no more coin and their paper
would not properly answer the purpose. At this time there.
was no thought of any ulterior process of "floating the bonds,"
which became the ultimate function of the legal-tender paper,
and indeed this argument, which implied an intentional depreciation
of the paper, would in 1862 have scarcely worked in
favor of the bill. How little weight was put on the idea of
"making money easy" is evident from the whole debate, but
so far as Mr. Spaulding is concerned, the following letter,
written on the 8th of January, 1862, is a sufficiently clear
statement:---

>DEAR SIR, --- In reply to yours of the 4th instant, I would say
that the Treasury Note Bill for $100,000,000 agreed upon in committee
yesterday is a measure of necessity and not one of choice. You
criticise matters very freely, and very likely you may be right in
what you say. We will be out of means to pay the daily expenses
in about thirty days, and the committee do not see any other way to
get along till we can get the tax-bills ready, except to issue temporarily
treasury notes. Perhaps you can suggest some other mode
of carrying on the government for the next one hundred days. ...
It is much easier to find fault than it is to suggest practicable means
or measures. We must have at least $ 100,000,000 of paying means
during the next three months, or the government must stop payment.
... I will thank you to suggest a better practicable mode of
getting $100,000,000 of paying means during the next three months.
I would be glad to adopt it, and the committee would be glad to
adopt it. Let us have your specific plan for this purpose, one that
will produce the money, and we will be very much obliged to you.

This curious letter, which, strange to say, Mr. Spaulding
has actually published, italics and all, as a meritorious document,
tells the whole story of the legal tender in its origin.
As a specimen of American finance and congressional ability
it will live in history. It presents the view on which, then as
now, the adherents of this measure have always wished to
place it before the public, --- as the only alternative to the immediate
stoppage of government. Not as a means of supplying
currency, nor of easing the money market, nor of "floating"
bonds, was the legal-tender paper first created, but solely
to supply a temporary want of $100,000,000, without which
the treasury must stop payments. And Mr. Spaulding flung
into the face of every doubter his contemptuous request to
suggest some better mode of raising the money, or in future
to keep silence.

Three days after this letter was written, Mr. Gallatin, on
the part of the New York banks, replied to Mr. Spaulding's
entreaties by the simple and business-like remark of a man
who knew what he was talking about, that it was only necessary
for Mr. Chase to sell his bonds at their market value, and
obtain what money he wanted. To this suggestion Mr.
Spaulding was called upon for a rejoinder. Obviously he was
bound to show that Mr. Gallatin was mistaken; that no such
alternative really existed; and that it was, for some reason or
other, impossible to sell the government bonds in the way
proposed. In the speech which has just been quoted Mr.
Spaulding did undertake to answer Mr. Gallatin, but he took
no such ground as this. He did not deny the efficacy of the
proposed measure. He did not even question the fact that
the resource suggested was both simple and easy. He only
appealed to the dignity of the government.

It appears, therefore, that there was an alternative to legal
tender, in spite of Mr. Spaulding's assertions that there was
none. What this alternative consisted in will be discussed in
a moment; but as the point is most material in the argument,
it will be well to establish here beyond dispute the fact that
the existence of this alternative was acknowledged by the supporters
of the bill almost in the same breath with which they
declared legal tender to be a necessity. In his speech of the
28th January, on introducing the bill in the House of Representatives,
Mr. Spaulding said:---

>The bill before us is a war measure, a measure of necessity, and not
of choice. ... We have the alternative either to go into the market
and sell our bonds for what they will command, or to pass this
bill. ... If you offer to the people and put upon the market
$ 300,000,000 to the highest bidder in the present state of affairs,
they would not be taken except at ruinous rates of discount. ...
I fear the twenty years six % bonds would under the pressure
fall to 75, 70, 60 and even 50 cents. ... Why, then, go into the
streets at all to borrow money! I prefer to assert the power and
dignity of the government by the issue of its own notes.

Mr. Hooper, who was second on Mr. Spaulding's committee,
said:---

>The propositions of committees from boards of trade and banks,
which recently visited Washington, differed from the theory of this
bill so far as to require that. ... the government bonds must first
be disposed of, and the money received for them paid to the contractors.
... The obvious effect of such an arrangement would
be to put the reins of our national finances in the hands of the
banks. ... To render the government financially more independent,
it is necessary to make the United States notes a legal tender. It
is possible that they would become a practical tender without providing
for them to be a legal tender.

The alternative, therefore, as seen by Mr. Hooper, was not
between legal tender and a stoppage of payments, but between
legal tender and dependence on the banks. Mr. Bingham's
idea of necessity was only a little more ridiculous:---

>"Great names," said Mr. Bingham, "have been invoked \[against
legal tender\] in this debate. For what purpose? For the purpose
of laying at the feet and at the mercy of brokers and hawkers on
'Change, the power of the people over their monetary interests in
this hour of their national exigency."

Mr. Thaddeus Stevens, again, had views of his own in re:gard
to the meaning of the word "necessity":---

>"This bill," said he, "is a measure of necessity, not of choice. ...
Here, then, in a few words lies your сHOICE. Throw bonds at six or
seven % on the market between this and December enough
to raise at least $600,000,000, or issue United States notes.
I maintain that the highest sum you could sell your bonds at would
be seventy-five %, payable in currency itself at a discount.
That would produce a loss which no nation or individual doing a
large business could stand a year."

Senator Sherman also used the word "necessity" in a sense
which would have been ludicrous if the subject had concerned
the metaphysical doctrine of fate and free will: "We must no
longer hesitate as to the necessity of this measure. That necessity
does exist, and now presses upon us. I rest my vote
upon the proposition that this is a necessary and proper measure
_to furnish a currency_." A more amusing example of anticlimax
than this is seldom seen in rhetoric.

It would be pleasant to linger over this subject, and enjoy
among these apparently tedious speeches the delicate touches
of involuntary humor which a critic finds so difficult to resist,
but it is useless to accumulate evidence of a point that is selfevident;
and it is unquestionable that even the strongest supporters
of the bill did not in any true and absolute sense
maintain that legal tender was necessary, but only that it
was preferable to the process of selling bonds at a discount
and retaining the old bank currency. The next step, therefore,
must lead to some closer discussion of this opinion, and
of the financial principles by which its justice can alone be
tested.

Finance is a subject which the liveliest writer may well
despair of making popular, since the mere sight or suspicion
of it is alone enough to cause every reader, except the dullest,
to close the most promising volume. A writer, therefore, can
have no hope of gaining a general hearing on such a topic.
Rarely can he expect sympathy among even business men,
unless he adopts the views they hold. Yet notwithstanding
this, it is and will remain true, and not only true but interesting,
that in the large experience of modern nations, some
few solid principles in finance have been established too firmly
to be shaken; and whether or no busy politicians or local
bankers choose to believe them, and whether or no the ordinary
reader choose to listen to them, the principles are sound
and will hold.

Hitherto in human history, the mind of man has succeeded
in conceiving of but two means by which governments can
obtain money. One of these is, to take. The other is, to
borrow. The hybrid and self-contradictory notion of a forced
loan resolves itself ultimately into one or the other of these
conceptions, and as a permanent policy is impossible. In
practice, where a government does not take, it must borrow.
Almost all modern nations are, to a greater or less extent,
habitual borrowers so far as their governments are concerned,
and therefore it is natural that, during two hundred years of
experience, the principles which regulate loans should have
been studied with some care, and simplified in some degree
into a science. After innumerable costly experiments and
elaborate study of the interests and motives of lenders and
borrowers, the effect of complicated financial schemes and
special pledges and conditions, it seems to be now acknowledged
by the shrewdest governments that the simplest bargain
is the best for the public, and that all financial tricks and devices,
all attempts to coax or deceive capitalists into better
conditions than they are ready to offer, in the end injure only
the government and the public. Simplicity has, therefore,
of late years been carried by the great borrowing nations to a
degree of scientific perfection beyond which there seems to be
no possibility of passing. According to this principle, governments
now sell their own credit without stipulation, reserve,
or condition. They sell, for example, their simple promise to
pay a thousand dollars a year so long as it is demanded. To
this promise no condition, expressed or implied, is attached,
except that the payment of a nominal principal may at any
time discharge the debt. For this promise they obtain whatever
they can, and experience has proved that, in the competition
of the world, the bargain thus struck is for both parties
the fairest.

Another simple law has also been established, and this is
that lenders will always prefer and pay most for a security on
which there is a certainty of permanence or a chance of profit,
other things being equal; that is to say, that a security is relatively
less valuable as it approaches its par and its redemption
than it should be, judging from the price paid for an
exactly similar security which has a better chance of permanence
or a wider limit of possible profit. The English 3 per
cents at eighty would commonly have a marked advantage in
the markets over 3½ per cents; in the first place, because the
margin of possible profit would be greater, and in the second
place, because there would be no prospect of disturbance in
the one case, while in the other redemption would be near at
hand. Experience, therefore, shows that governments as a
rule obtain relatively a low price for a security which they
insist upon selling at par.

This obvious fact induces most governments to adapt their
offer to the market in such a way as to combine these inducements.
If the market rate of interest is at 4%, they
commonly offer 3½ or 3%, and thus dispose of their
credit at a discount on better terms than if they attempted
to outbid the market rate. The American government, on the
other hand, has commonly pursued a different course. While
insisting that it will borrow only at the market rate, that is,
at par, it has found itself compelled to concede something in
order to be allowed to borrow at all. In the first place it has
to concede a high rate of interest, but even this is not enough.
Lenders require permanence. It accepts, therefore, the condition
that it shall not attempt to redeem its bonds until after
the lapse of a term of years, --- five or ten, or whatever may
be agreed upon. The expedient is clumsy, but the ignorant
prejudice against usury compels its adoption, although, like
all such devices, it works in practice only against the public
interest and in favor of the capitalist. Another condition,
however, to which the United States government is in the
habit of pledging itself is entirely gratuitous. This is the obligation
to redeem after a certain number of years, --- an obligation
which works wholly against the public interest, and
which is without excuse on financial grounds, although the
incessant enforcement of a temporary character in the national
debt is considered its excuse from a political stand-point.

Every established principle of finance, therefore, indicated
that government credit could be sold to more advantage at
a certain nominal discount than if a higher interest or any
equivalent condition were insisted upon in order to "float" it
at par. If, therefore, the government had chosen to authorize
the sale of six % bonds at their market price, omitting
from the contract all restriction on its own free control over
them, it would have done precisely what all established financial
rules enjoin, and for such bonds it would unquestionably
have obtained the best terms which were then to be had, while
at the present day the nation would have owed a homogeneous
debt, with which it would have been free to deal as it chose.
Mr. Spaulding, however, apparently imagined that he had discovered
some new principle in finance, by which the government
might raise money through a process which should be
neither taxation nor loan. Before three years had passed the
government was selling its six % bonds at a rate equivalent
to very nearly thirty-five cents on the dollar; but at
this time the idea of its credit selling at a discount of twenty
or thirty or forty % was so revolting to Congress that
it was not even to be entertained. Mr. Gallatin talked in vain.
Nor was it Mr. Spaulding and members of Congress alone who
were extravagant on this theme. At least one gentleman who
should have known better, --- Mr. Moses H. Grinnell of New
York,--- encouraged the same delusion. "As for G\[allatin\]
and a few egotistical gentlemen that act with him, they should
be driven out of Washington, as they only embarrass the government.
There are not eight bank presidents that side with
G\[allatin\]. He is an odd fish,--- has very little influence here."
These were the terms used by Mr. Grinnell in a letter dated
the 30th January, 1862, and it was a curious sign of the times
that the only man who seems to have had a clear and practical
knowledge of what the occasion required should have really
been "an odd fish."

But it is not enough to show that this idea about "shinning"
through Wall Street was almost inconceivably absurd,
seeing that every government always does and always must
borrow on the best terms it can get, or not borrow at all, in
which case it can have no resource but to tax. The event
soon showed that the men who treated so contemptuously the
idea of the nation's credit being sold at a discount were the
first to convert this same legal-tender paper into the instrument
by which the government was to "shin," not only
through Wall Street during the short emergency of the war,
but through every lane and alley of the land during a period
that now seems interminable. Congress and the government
followed Mr. Spaulding's doctrine, that the nation's credit must
not be sold at a discount, and the result was that, as the laws
of society are inflexible, while the laws of Congress are not
omnipotent, there ensued a period of "shinning " which has
seldom had a parallel. The dollar which Congress had set up
was "shaved" through Wall Street at twenty, thirty, forty,
fifty, and sixty cents discount. Europe bought the United
States six per cents at about thirty-five cents on the dollar,
notwithstanding Mr. Stevens's asseverations that no nation.
could afford to borrow at seventy without being ruined in a
year. But if Mr. Spaulding and his friends could have foreseen,
not only that the government would be compelled to
perform this process of "shinning" during four long years,
but that, thanks to them and to them alone, the government
credit and its broken promises-to-pay would for years longer
be hawked about Wall Street at whatever price they could
command, and would become the support by which Mr. Jay
Gould and Mr. James Fisk, Jr., and their like, would succeed
in bolstering up their scandalous schemes against the pressure
of sound economical laws, the statesmen of 1862 might perhaps
have gained more sensible ideas in regard to the treatment
of government credit.

In justice to the Secretary of the Treasury, it must be said
that, on the day of the conference, he showed no symptom of
yielding to Mr. Spaulding's influence. He remained then as
before hostile to the principle of legal tender, and before the
bank delegates left Washington he succeeded in agreeing with
them upon a new financial arrangement which included the
adoption of his policy in regard to the bank currency, and rejected
the resort to legal tender. Nor would it perhaps have
affected the success of his scheme, that Mr. Spaulding and his
committee deemed it inadequate and withheld their assent.
There was a different reason than this, which caused the compromise
between Mr. Chase and the banks to fail. The gentleman
who represented the Boston banks on that occasion found
on his return to Massachusetts that the arrangement he had
made was not satisfactory to them, and he at once telegraphed
this information to the Secretary. Then for the first time Mr.
Chase yielded his better judgment, and, relying on his own
power and will to control the issues, accepted the policy of
legal tender, for which Boston influence thus became immediately
answerable. Having once made his determination
to adopt the policy, the Secretary was not a man to hesitate
in carrying it out. He had been drawn into it against his
most deeply rooted convictions and his better judgment, but
no sooner was the decision made than he threw his whole
weight in favor of the bill.

Thus, in spite of the treasury and the banks and the active
remonstrances of a great part of the community, the bill came
before the House of Representatives as a government measure.
Two months of delay and confusion had seriously complicated
the difficulties of the case, but even yet no necessity existed
which could in any just sense be considered to exact the adoption
of legal tender. The cry of necessity was indeed raised,
and prolonged without a pause, but it was raised merely because
no solid argument could be found. The ablest members
of Congress denied the necessity without qualification,
and, as has already been shown, the ideas of necessity held by
the different supporters of the bill were almost as various as
the speeches.

The debate began on the 28th of January, by a speech from
Mr. Spaulding, in which he explained at considerable length
his reasons for forcing on the country a measure which was so
generally obnoxious. There seems to be something almost
extravagant in so often recalling attention to Mr. Spaulding's
speeches, which have little intrinsic claim to notice. But Mr.
Spaulding was at this moment in a position of vast responsibility.
His activity and persistence had carried the bill "over
the administration," and were now to carry it through the
House. It is not easy, therefore, to set him aside as a person
of no consequence, or to pass his opinions by as undeserving
of attention; and indeed, however open to criticism these
opinions may have been, Mr. Spaulding has a perfect right to
claim that they were little if at all inferior in merit to those
expressed by the other friends of the bill. It is true that if
any object were to be gained by reviewing this ground, if it
were intended to conciliate support for new opinions, or to lay
down principles for a new party, it would be well to speak in
milder terms of men whose power and authority have not yet
passed wholly away. But the only inquiry that can have value
here is to ask how the future historian will be compelled to treat
this chapter of American history; and, unless the world is to
move backward, it seems as though he must inevitably declare
that not all the campaigns of all the unfortunate or incompetent
generals employed during the Rebellion can furnish an
instance of grosser mistreatment than was offered by Congress
in these debates. The good sense and high moral standard
of a few men served only to relieve and make more conspicuous
the dark and impenetrable cloud of ignorance against
which their efforts were utterly thrown away. This language
is no doubt strong, but it is strictly true. It would, for example,
have been difficult for any human being to compress
within the same limited space a greater number of mistaken
ideas than are contained in the following extract from Mr.
Spaulding's speech of January 28th:---

>The bill before us is a war measure, a measure of necessity, not
of choice. ... Congress may judge of the necessity in the present
exigency. It may decide whether it will authorize the Secretary
of the Treasury to issue demand treasury notes, and make them a
legal tender in payment of debts, or whether it will put its 6 or 7% bonds on the market, at ruinous rates of discount, and raise
the money at any sacrifice the money-lenders may require, to meet
the pressing demands upon the treasury. In the one case the government
will be able to pay its debts at fair rates of interest; in the
other, it must go into the streets shinning for the means, like an individual
in failing circumstances, and sure of being used up in the
end by the avarice of those who may exact unreasonable terms.
But, sir, knowing the power of money, and the disposition there is
among men to use it for the acquisition of greater gain, I am unwilling
that this government, with all its immense power and resources,
should be left in the hands of any class of men, bankers, or moneylenders,
however respectable or patriotic they may be. The government
is much stronger than any of them. Its capital is much greater.
It has control of all the bankers' money and all the brokers' money,
and all the property of the thirty millions of people under its jurisdiction.
Why then should it go into Wall Street, State Street, Chestnut
Street, or any other street, begging for money? Their money is
not as secure as government money. All the gold they possess
would not carry on the goverment for ninety days. They issue only
promises to pay, which, if Congress does its duty, are not half as
secure as United States treasury notes based on adequate taxation
of all the property of the country. Why, then, go into the streets at
all to borrow money? I am opposed in our present extremities to
all shifts of this kind. I prefer to assert the power and dignity of
the government by the issue of its own notes.

He would be a bold man who should undertake to say that
these remarks can, by any process of explanation, be made intelligible.
The conclusion, however, is clear enough, and is
well worth attention. Had Mr. Spaulding's studies ever led
him to read Goethe's Faust, he might at this point have recalled
the scene where Mephistopheles, in the character of
court-jester, invents for the empire a legal-tender currency
based on the firm foundation of old treasures which in past
ages might have been hidden underground, and applauds his
own creation as better than coin, because, if the bankers refused
to give coin for it, the holder would at worst have only
the trouble of digging. The great satirist, however, with all
his genius, was not so great a satirist as Mr. Spaulding. He
never thought of carrying the bitterness of his sarcasm so far
as to invoke the dignity of the empire as the chief glory of his
paper money, and yet Mephistopheles closes his scene with the
exulting exclamation :---

>Wer zweifelt noch an unsers Narren Witz!

Yet one thing remains to be said before quitting Mr. Spaulding.
If he really had an idea in his own mind, and sincerely
believed that the government need not go into the streets at
all to borrow money, and that a simple assertion of its own
dignity would place it in command of indefinite resources; in
other words, if he thought that the dignity of the government
forbade its borrowing, except on its own terms, and that there
was no necessity for it to borrow at all, it is a matter of grave
question how he can justify himself in having consented that
the government should pay 6% or even 1% for
money, or should promise to repay any money whatever.

The argument of Mr. Hooper was less extravagant. He
avoided committing himself to anything except to a cautious
opinion that the paper issue would make the government financially
more independent, and that if Mr. Chase were discreet,
the quality of legal tender would help him to keep the notes
at par. The latter opinion may, perhaps, be questioned, and
indeed Mr. Chase has himself questioned it in his late judgment,
but at least it was not absurd.

Mr. Bingham, however, rivalled Mr. Spaulding, though in
different way. His speech was necessarily made without reference
to financial principles, since Mr. Bingham made no pretence
to the slightest acquaintance with that subject. He
therefore assumed at the outset that the bill was necessary,
because it was said to be necessary, and he then burst into a
brilliant denunciation of all persons who refused to believe
in the necessity. Mr. Roscoe Conkling was the victim first
immolated.

>Sir, said Mr. Bingham, "as a representative of the people I cannot
keep silent when I see efforts made upon this side of the house
and upon that, to lay the power of the American people to control
the currency at the feet of brokers and of city bankers, who have
not a tittle of authority, save by the assent or forbearance of the
people, to deal in their paper issued as money. I am here to-day
to assert the rightful authority of the American people as a nationality,
sovereignty, under and by virtue of their Constitution.

Such legal finance would not call for notice, except that it
came from a leader in Congress, who, in order to protect the
sovereignty of the American people from bankers and brokers,
insisted upon creating a legal-tender paper currency, which has
always been and always will be the most efficient instrument
ever yet discovered for the worst purposes of this very class
of men. Yet Mr. Bingham denounced his opponents for acting
with the purpose of sacrificing the public interest to the
interest of bankers and brokers. At the same time it is mortifying
to observe the ignorance and vulgar prejudice with
which the bankers and brokers of the country were always
mentioned in these debates. Perhaps no other single characteristic
offers so much instruction as this simple fact, in re:gard
to the temper and the range of thought exhibited in this
momentous discussion. Mr. Bingham's remarks have already
been quoted. Mr. Stevens, with his usual nice discrimination,
characterized the dealers in money as "sharks and brokers,"
to which he afterwards added "harpies." Mr. Shellabarger,
after appropriating bodily and almost literally several pages
of Macaulay's most luminous and most familiar writing, in
the effort to maintain himself on Macaulay's level without
Macaulay's aid, could discover no more original idea for his
peroration than to denounce the outside opposition to this bill
as coming from interested persons in the expectation "that out
of the blood of their sinking country they may be enabled to
coin the gains of their infamy." Senator Wilson announced
that the practical question lay between "brokers and jobbers
and money-changers on the one side, and the people of the
United States on the other." Invective like this properly belongs
only to a debating-club of boys. But if invective were
to be used at all, and if these bankers had been represented
in Congress by any person capable of using it, he might easily
have retaliated in a manner which would have left little opportunity
for an effective rejoinder. He might have replied
that men who claim to be trusted for all they say in regard to
a financial exigency; who assert in one breath that a necessity
exists, which in the next breath they acknowledge does
not exist; who presume on this utterly unwarrantable plea of
necessity to exculpate themselves from what, without exculpation,
is the wickedest vote the representative of the people can
ever give; a vote which delivers labor to the mercy of capital;
a vote which forces upon the people that as money which in
no just sense is money; a vote which establishes as law one
of the most abominable frauds which law can ever be prostituted
to enforce; --- that such men are not the persons to
judge of others' patriotism, honesty, or good sense.

And here it may be proper to add a remark as to the disposition
of Congress to stumble over constitutional difficulties.
A very large part of the debate turned on the point of
technical construction of the Constitution; and many members
of the legislature who hesitated about nothing else found
an insurmountable obstacle here. The constitutional argument,
whatever its weight may be, is one on which only
lawyers will be likely to insist. Whether, under a strict interpretation
of constitutional powers, the law of legal tender is
to be justified or not, can make but little difference to persons
who look for their principles of action beneath the letter of
the Constitution, to the principles upon which all government
and all society must ultimately rest. The law of legal tender
was an attempt by artificial legislation to make something
true which was false. This is the sum-total of the argument
against legal tender, and this argument is based on the eternal
maxim that the foundation of law is truth. If it is possible
for the rhetoric of congressional orators or the ingenuity of
professional lawyers to reduce the principle involved to simpler
elements than this, at all events neither the debates at the
Capitol nor the arguments at the bar, however brilliant or
elaborate they may have been, have as yet shown any probability
of success.

It would be pleasant to extract from the speeches delivered
in favor of this bill any such portions as show depths of knowledge,
elevation of morals, or breadth of mind. Unfortunately
nothing of the sort exists. Almost all the soundest minds in
the House declared themselves against legal tender and denied
its necessity. Judge Thomas of Massachusetts and Mr. Roscoe
Conkling of New York, Mr. Morrill of Vermont, from the Committee
of Ways and Means, Mr. Horton of Ohio, also of the
Ways and Means, all the Democratic members, and others who
contented themselves with a silent vote, opposed the legaltender
clause. And by some freak of nature, which seems
occasionally to amuse itself with putting into the mouths of
extreme and violent men language and argument which express
the most elevated sense of fitness, the speech of Mr.
Owen Lovejoy of Illinois was in its short space as clear, as
vigorous, and, from a rhetorical point of view, as perfect, as
the oldest statesman or the most exacting critic or the deepest
student of finance could have hoped or wished to make. But
although the opponents of the measure were far superior in
intellect to its supporters, and although their arguments were
essentially sound, and under ordinary circumstances would
probably have proved successful, they could not deal with the
authority of the executive, which Mr. Chase now used with all
his energy in favor of the bill. On the 6th of February Mr.
Spaulding pressed his measure to a vote, and it passed the
House by a majority of 93 to 59.

One can scarcely resist the conclusion that, had the bill
originated in the Senate, and been discussed without the prejudice
arising from the responsibility of rejecting what was
approved by the House and urged by the Executive, and had
it been acted upon before so much valuable time had been
lost, the country would probably for the time have been spared
the great misfortune of its adoption. This opinion is rendered
probable by the higher and more statesmanlike spirit in
which the Senate discussed the proposed measure. If it were
possible that a mere word of unqualified admiration could
please the ear or help to soothe the rest of a statesman whose
loss the nation has regretted but has never fairly appreciated,
there would be a keen and personal pleasure in repeating
the language of Mr. Fessenden, who reported this bill to the
Senate:---

>The question after all returns: is this measure absolutely indispensable
>to procure means? If so, as I said before, necessity knows
>no law. What are the objections to it? I will state them as briefly
>as I can. The first is a negative objection. A measure of this kind
>certainly cannot increase confidence in the ability or integrity of the
>country. ...
>
>Next, in my judgment, it is a confession of bankruptcy. ...
>
>Again, say what you will, nobody can deny that it is bad faith
>. ... and encourages bad morality both in public and private. ...
>
>Again, it encourages bad morals, because if the currency falls
>(as it is supposed it must, else why defend it by a legal enactment),
>what is the result? It is that every man who desires to pay off his
>debts at a discount, no matter what the circumstances are, is able to
>avail himself of it against the will of his neighbor who honestly contracted
>to receive something better.
>
>Again, sir, necessarily as a result, in my judgment, it must inflict
>a stain upon the national honor. ...
>
>Again, sir, it necessarily changes the value of all property. ...
>
>Again, sir, a stronger objection than all that I have to this proposition
>is that the loss must fall most heavily upon the poor by reason
>of the inflation.

He concluded by declaring that in his opinion the legal-tender
clause was not necessary, and he reported several amendments.
One of these, the second, he described in these terms:
"The committee . ... give to the Secretary the power to sell
the bonds of the government at any time that it may be
necessary, at the market price, in order to raise coin. That
can always be done." This amendment was ultimately adopted
and became part of the bill, but the Secretary preferred reaching
the same result by a different policy, and the old system
was therefore retained.

But it was reserved for Mr. Collamer of Vermont to take
yet stronger and more uncompromising ground. "Even if it
was a necessity," said he, "I would not vote for this measure."
Fidelity to a trust is not so universal that one might not be
permitted to sympathize with a man who, when placed between
the alternatives of utter destruction on the one hand and what
he thinks a breach of trust on the other, in spite of necessity
still maintains the standard of his personal honor. But there
was in reality no such bravado in this declaration of Judge
Collamer's. It was not mere impracticability that prompted
his resistance, but a superior discernment that the evidence
of necessity which imposes on a legislative body in times of
panic is not to be trusted. Even on a calculation of chances,
it is far more likely that other resources are available than
that so desperate an expedient should offer the only hope of
salvation. Nay, a measure which in itself is inherently and
irredeemably wrong cannot in any just sense be a necessity.
Mr. Collamer's speech, therefore, was only an energetic expression
of his resolution, not that he would refuse to obey
necessity, but that he would refuse to believe it.

The position taken by Mr. Sumner wanted only the same
defiant confidence in the eternal laws of truth to have made it
still more impressive than any of the others. Unhappily, by
the side of Mr. Fessenden and Mr. Collamer, his conclusions
seemed tinged with irresolution :---

>And now, as I close, I will not cease to be frank. Is it necessary
to incur all the unquestionable evils of inconvertible paper,
forced into circulation by act of Congress,--- to suffer the stain upon
our national faith,--- to bear the stigma of a seeming repudiation, ---
to lose for the present that credit which in itself is a treasury, --- and
to teach debtors everywhere that contracts may be varied at the
will of the stronger? Surely there is much in these inquiries which
may make us pause. ... It is hard, very hard, to think that such a
country, so powerful, so rich, and so beloved, should be compelled
to adopt a policy of even questionable propriety. ... Surely we
must all be against paper money,--- we must all insist on maintaining
the integrity of the government, --- and we must all set our faces
against any proposition like the present, except as a temporary expedient
rendered imperative by the exigency of the hour. ... Others
may doubt if the exigency is sufficiently imperative, but the Secretary
of the Treasury does not doubt. ... Reluctantly, painfully, I
consent that the process should issue.

The authority of the Secretary of the Treasury overruled
the scruples of the Senate, and the bill passed by a majority
of five votes on the legal-tender clause. It is scarcely worth
while to carry the scene back to the House, in order to ascertain
the fate of the Senate amendments, or to cull from the
second debate new subjects for quotation. It is easy, only too
easy, to ridicule and satirize the doctrines of public men, and
something like an apology to the public is due for the extent
to which this appetite has been indulged in these pages. It is
but just to add that Mr. Spaulding at least did strongly and
invariably insist upon the difference between legal-tender notes
that were fundable and the later issue of greenbacks which
were not so. In point of fact the difference was very slight.
There was nothing in the condition of fundability which made
legal tender anything but legal tender, nor would the principle
of legal tender have been any sounder, even though it had
been attached to the bonds themselves. It is amusing to notice
that, as the later issues of legal tender were made, and the
depreciation became excessive, Mr. Spaulding by similar steps
became virtuous, until at last his virtue grew intense. He attributed
the failure of his favorite financial scheme to the
mistakes of others, and he proposed as an infallible cure a
restoration of his funding proviso. There is little probability
that Mr. Spaulding's mind will ever succeed in gaining a higher
stand-point than this, or will ever look over a wider horizon
where it can more broadly measure the uncontrollable power
of the elements which he, like the unlucky companions of
Ulysses, ignorantly set free.

Such was the history of the legal-tender bill. So far as any
evidence of its necessity can be drawn from the action of the
Executive at the time, the late decision of Chief Justice Chase
has left no doubt as to the facts. That Mr. Chase should, as
Secretary of the Treasury, have adopted the course he did
was doubly unfortunate in the first place, because he created
legal tender; and in the second place, because when the delusion
was over, and his mind reverted to its first sound principles,
the action he had taken as Secretary of the Treasury
remained in the public memory to reduce the authority of the
opinions he was bound to express as Chief Justice. Into the
legal correctness or political propriety of these opinions it is
no purpose of this essay to enter. No one who holds strong
convictions against legal tender as a measure of finance is
likely greatly to trouble his mind with the question whether
such a power has or has not been conferred by the Constitution
upon Congress. Though it were conferred in the most
explicit terms language is capable of supplying, there could
be no excuse on that account for changing an opinion as to its
financial merits, and its financial merits are not a subject for
lawyers, nor even for judges, as such, to decide. These happily
rest on principles deeper than statute or than constitu
tional law. They appeal to no written code, and whenever the
public attempts to overrule them, the public does so only at
its own peril.

There remains but one more point to touch. The common
impression undoubtedly is, that even though there were no
actual necessity for a law of legal tender so early as February,
1862, yet at some subsequent time the enactment of such a
law would have proved inevitable. This opinion should properly
form the subject of a separate paper. If it be once acknowledged
that the law of February, 1862, was unnecessary
and passed by a practical fraud, the whole condition of the
argument is changed. Whenever the public has reached this
point, it will be time to enter upon the wider field of discussion
into which so vague and general a proposition must lead. Yet,
without venturing at present on any absolute denial of the
theory, since this would require much explanation and reasoning,
it is only fair to say that, although the subject is scarcely
capable at present of positive demonstration, there is absolutely
no evidence to prove that the government might not
have carried the war to a successful conclusion without the
issue of a single dollar of its legal-tender paper. Such
appears to be the opinion of the Chief Justice, as it is undoubtedly
the natural inference from economical principles.

It is, however, true that after the first issues of the paper,
its original purpose and importance as a resource against a
temporary exigency --- that purpose which had been so discreditably
used in forcing the bill through Congress --- was
almost wholly lost from sight, and the paper assumed entirely
new functions as a financial instrument.

The government, adhering to the policy of selling its bonds
only at par, was obliged to consider its paper as the par standard,
and the next step was to issue of its own accord enough
paper to "float" the successive loans. This was equivalent
to selling its credit at the market price, with the addition of
voluntarily degrading its own standard of value. In order to
protect the nation's credit from degradation in the hands of
bankers and brokers, the government undertook to dishonor it
of its own free will. As a financial policy, this tortuous and
disreputable expedient will not bear a moment's examination;
but there was one incidental function of the paper, closely
connected with this, on which more stress may be laid. The
issue of paper money in large quantities does produce a temporary
and feverish excitement, which, during a certain
length of time, may facilitate borrowing, though at a frightful
ultimate cost. If the sole object of the legal tender were to
cause this temporary stimulus, and if this stimulus can be
proved to have been essential to financial success, the management
of the nation's financial affairs during the war may
admit of excuse if not of praise. Unfortunately, neither of
these conditions can be established.

This essay aims at no advocacy of any financial nostrum,
nor at any cure of present difficulties. In the popular humor
of the moment, it is more than ever doubtful whether any
advice that is wise would be listened to, or whether any advice
that has a chance of being listened to could possibly be wise.
Mere knowledge has no hold upon political power in its treatment
of this subject. Other considerations are supreme both
in Congress and in the public mind. But although knowledge,
and the application of simple truth in politics, are for the
present divorced from power and no longer control the course
of current events, yet at least the past belongs to them as
their exclusive property, and no one can prevent the past from
receiving, sooner or later, the judgment which historical criticism
must inevitably exact for the betrayal of principles to
which it pretended allegiance.
