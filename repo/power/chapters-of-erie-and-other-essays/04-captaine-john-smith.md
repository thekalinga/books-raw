The ordinary reader will see in the small book lately published
by Mr. Deane a simple reprint of a black-letter
pamphlet which is one of the most precious jewels of American
bibliopoles. There is not a word in the title-page to suggest
that the Introduction and notes, which are the work of the
editor, serve any other purpose than to explain and illustrate
the text. The volume is in appearance as innocent and free
from heretical taint as the reprint of the New England Primer.
Yet any one familiar with the course of Mr. Deane's previous
inquiries knows quite well, in taking up the book, that he is
about to find very original views in regard to some extremely
interesting questions of colonial history; and if Mr. Deane
has chosen to adopt this modest form of publication, it is by
no means because what he has to say would not warrant an
original and independent work bearing his own name alone
on the title-page. If the opinions advanced by Mr. Deane,
which it will be our aim to explain, are correct, a very serious
change in received ideas concerning the early history of Virginia
will be necessary, and one to which the American people
will find it difficult to reconcile themselves.

[^/192]: From the North American Review for January, 1867.

Stated in its widest bearings, the question raised in this
publication is upon the veracity of Captain John Smith; and
since the account of the colonization of Virginia has hitherto
been almost exclusively drawn from Smith's Generall Historie,
it is evident that, if the authority of that work is overthrown,
it will become necessary to reconsider, not merely the statements
of fact which rest only on its assertions, but the whole
series of opinions which through it have been grafted upon
history. These statements and opinions have been received
with unhesitating confidence for more than two hundred years.
There are powerful social interests, to say nothing of popular
prejudices, greatly concerned in maintaining the credit of
Smith's narrative even at the present day. No object whatever
can be gained by discrediting it, except the establishment
of bald historical truth. A very strong case indeed must
therefore be made out on the part of Mr. Deane and of those
who follow him, before the American public can be induced to
listen with attention to an argument which aims at nothing
less than the entire erasure of one of the most attractive portions
of American history.

Captain John Smith belonged to the extraordinary school
of adventurers who gave so much lustre to the reign of Elizabeth,
and whose most brilliant leader it was one of King
James's exploits to bring to the Tower and the block. Like
Raleigh, though on a much lower level, Smith sustained many
different characters; he was a soldier or a sailor indifferently,
a statesman when circumstances gave him power, and an author
when occasion required. He was born in Lincolnshire
in 1579, of what is supposed to have been a good Lancashire
family. At a very early age he became a soldier of fortune in
the Low Countries, and seems to have drifted into the Austrian
service, where he took part in the campaign of 1600 against
the Turks. Afterwards he reappears as a soldier of the Prince
of Transylvania, who gave him a coat of arms, which was
registered at the Herald's College in London. The extraordinary
adventures which he met with during the three or four
years of his life in Eastern Europe are related in his Autobiography,
or "True Travels," a work published in London in
1630, near the close of his life. There is an interesting note
in Dr. Palfrey's History of New England (Vol. I. pp. 89--92)
which contains the earliest critical examination of this portion.
of Smith's story from an historical and geographical point of
view, with a result not on the whole unfavorable to Smith,
although under reservations which admit a considerable degree
of doubt as to particulars. In the absence of other authorities,
however, the credit of the Autobiography must be left to
stand or fall with that of the Generall Historie.

In 1604 Smith was again in England, where he soon began
to interest himself in the enterprise of colonizing America.

On the 10th of April, 1606, King James conferred a charter
upon certain persons in England, who took the title of the
Virginia Company, and who proceeded to fit out an expedition
of three small vessels, containing, in addition to their crews,
one hundred and five colonists, headed by a Council, of which
Edward Maria Wingfield was chosen President, and Captains
Bartholomew Gosnold, John Smith, John Ratcliffe, John Martin,
and George Kendall were the other members. After various
delays this expedition dropped down the Thames on the
20th of December of the same year, but was still kept six
weeks in sight of England by unfavorable winds. After a long
and difficult voyage, and a further delay of three weeks among
the West India Islands, the headlands of Chesapeake Bay
were passed on the 26th of April, 1607. On the 14th of May
following, the colonists formally founded Jamestown.

But in the mean while a difficulty, the true causes of which
are not well understood, had created trouble between Smith
and his colleagues. Smith's own story is told in the Generall
Historie as follows: "Now Captain Smith, who all this time
from their departure from the Canaries was restrained as a
prisoner upon the scandalous suggestions of some of the chiefe
(envying his repute) who fained he intended to usurpe the
Government, murther the Councell, and make himselfe King,
that his confederats were dispersed in all the three ships, and
that divers of his confederats that revealed it would affirm it,
for this he was committed as a prisoner: thirteen weeks he
remained thus suspected, and by that time the ships should
returne, they pretended out of their commisserations to refer
him to the Councell in England to receive a check, rather then
by particulating his designes make him so odious to the world,
as to touch his life, or utterly overthrow his reputation."

The truth was, that Captain Newport, who was about to
return to England, exerted his influence so strongly in favor
of harmony, that Smith was allowed to resume his seat among
the Council. But we are left entirely in ignorance of the real
motives of Smith's colleagues, and the evidence, if any, on
which they acted. One fact, however, is quite clear; Smith
was not liked by the persons in control of the expedition, and
it is possible that some little light on the causes of this dislike
or suspicion may be found in a passage of Wingfield's "Discourse,"
a work which we shall hereafter have occasion to
mention at greater length. Wingfield, who was one of Smith's
opponents, says that "it was proved to his face that he begged
in Ireland, like a rogue without a lycence." And he adds,
"To such I would not my name should be a companyon."
One may imagine that, if Smith were really accused of conspiring
to obtain power, the dark events and questionable
expedients of his varied and troubled career might well be
flung in his face, and produce a considerable influence on the
minds of his judges.

Harmony, however, was a blessing which was little known
among the unhappy colonists, and it is worth noticing that,
before the close of the year, Captain George Kendall, another
of the members of the Council, was accused of the same crime
with which Smith had been charged, and was tried, convicted,
and actually executed. Newport, who seems to have had great
influence over the colonists, returned to England on the 22d
of June, leaving three months' supplies behind him, and promising
to return in seven months with a new company of settlers.
His departure was followed by a series of disasters and
troubles of every description. The mortality was frightful.
More than forty deaths took place before September, some of
which were caused by fevers and sickness, some by the Indians,
but the larger number by mere famine. The kindness of the
Indians alone, if we may believe the express statement of
Percy, who was among the survivors, preserved the remaining
colonists from the fate of the lost Roanoke settlement of 1585.

Even this terrible condition of the colony, though during
five months together there were not five able-bodied men to
mount the defences, had no effect in quieting the jealousies
and dissensions of the leaders. Captain Gosnold died, leaving
only Wingfield, Ratcliffe, Smith, and Martin in the Council.
The last three combined to depose Wingfield; and this revolution
took place on the 10th of September, without resistance.
Ratcliffe, as the next in order, was chosen President, although
there is strong reason to believe that Wingfield was the better
man.

It became absolutely necessary to obtain supplies in order
to preserve the lives of the few remaining colonists. "As at
this time," says Smith, "were most of our chiefest men either
sicke or discontented, the rest being in such despaire as they
would rather starve and rot with idlenes, then be persuaded
to do anything for their owne reliefe without constraint: our
victualles being now within eighteene dayes spent, and the
Indians trade decreasing, I was sent to the mouth of ye river to
trade for Corne, and try the River for Fish, but our fishing we
could not effect by reason of the stormy weather." Fortunately
the Indians were found willing to trade for corn, and by
means of their supplies the lives of the settlers were saved.
On the 9th of November, Smith made a longer excursion,
partially exploring the Chickahominy, and was received with
much kindness by the Indians, who supplied him with corn
enough to have "laded a ship." Elated by his success and
encouraged by the friendly attitude of the savages, or, according
to his own account, eager "to discharge the imputation
of malicious tungs, that halfe suspected I durst not, for so long
delaying," he determined to carry on his exploration of the
Chickahominy to its source. On the 10th of December he
set out in the pinnace, which he left at a place he calls Apocant,
forty miles from the mouth of the Chickahominy, and continued
his journey in a barge. Finally, rather than endanger the
barge, he hired a canoe and two Indians to row it, and with
two of his own company, named Robinson and Emry, he went
twenty miles higher. "Though some wise men may condemn
this too bould attempt of too much indiscretion, yet if they
well consider the friendship of the Indians, in conducting me,
the desolatenes of the country, the probability of \[discovering\]
some lake, and the malicious judges of my actions at
home, as also to have some matters of worth to incourage our
adventurers in England, might well have caused any honest
minde to have done the like, as wel for his own discharge, as
for the publike good."

At length they landed to prepare their dinner, and Smith
with one Indian walked on along the course of the river, while
Robinson and Einry with the other Indian remained to guard
the canoe. Within a quarter of an hour he heard a hallooing
of Indians and a loud cry, and, fearing treachery, he seized
his guide, whose arm he bound fast to his own hand, while he
prepared his pistol for immediate use. As they "went discoursing,"
an arrow struck him on the right thigh, but without
harm. He soon found himself attacked by some two hundred
savages, against whose arrows he used his guide as a shield,
discharging his pistol three or four times. The Indian chief,
Opechankanough, then called upon him to surrender, and the
savages laid their bows on the ground, ceasing to shoot. "My
hiude treated betwixt them and me of conditions of peace, he
discovered me to be the Captaine, my request was to retire to
ye boate; they demanded my armes, the rest they saide were
slaine, only me they would reserve: the Indian importuned me
not to shoot. In retiring being in the midst of a low quagmire,
and minding them more than my steps, I stept fast
into the quagmire, and also the Indian in drawing me forth:
thus surprised, I resolved to trie their mercies, my armes I
caste from me, till which none durst approch me: being
ceazed on me they drew me out and led me to the King."

Thus far, to avoid confusion, we have followed the account
given in the True Relation, written by Smith, and published
in London in 1608, the year following the events described.
But in 1624 Smith published in London his Generall Historie,
which contains a version of the story varying essentially from
that of the True Relation. In continuing, therefore, the account
of his captivity, the two narratives will be placed side
by side, for convenience of comparison, and the principal
variations will be printed in Italics. After describing the
circumstances of his capture, which took place far up on the
Chickahominy River, Smith proceeds in his double narrative
as follows:---

The instant result of comparing the two narratives thus for
the first time placed side by side, is to bring into sharp prominence
a certain curious tone of exaggeration which characterizes
the later story. Eight guards, which had been sufficient
in 1608, are multiplied into thirty or forty tall fellows in 1624.
What was enough for ten men at the earlier time would feed
twenty according to the later version. Four guides were
surely an ample escort to conduct Smith to Jamestown, but
they are reinforced to the number of twelve sixteen years
afterwards. With the best disposition towards Smith, one
cannot but remember that this was just the period when
Falstaff and his misbegotten knaves in Kendal Green appeared
upon the stage. The execution wrought upon the
wretched lawyers who wished to try Smith for his life on his
return to Jamestown is most prompt and decisive, according
to the story of 1624, but in 1608 Smith is happy to accept the
aid of Captain Newport to disembarrass him of his too-powerful
enemies. With sabre, falcon, and musket-shot he forced
the mutinous crew of the pinnace to stay or sink, if we are to
believe the Generall Historie, while the True Relation is quite
silent as to any such feat of arms, but simply observes that
Captain Newport arrived the same evening.

The same character of exaggeration marks the whole account
of the treatment he received among the savages.
According to the story written a few months after the event,
a people is described, savage it is true, but neither cruel nor
bloodthirsty; reckless, perhaps, of life in battle, but kind
and even magnanimous towards their captive. Here is an express
statement that no such demonstration was made against
Smith as is affirmed in 1624, to have taken place within an
hour after his capture. Only a few days after he was taken
prisoner, he represents himself as giving orders to Opechankanough
to take him to Powhatan, and even at this time he
knew that he was to be allowed to return to Jamestown. "To
him I told him I must go, and so return to Paspahegh." Powhatan
received him with the greatest cordiality, and, having
sought to content him with all the kindness he could devise,
did actually send him with a guard of honor back to his
friends. If the True Relation is really true, the behavior of
these naked barbarians towards Smith was far more humane
than that which he would have received at the hands of
any civilized nation on the face of the earth. There is not
a trace of his having felt any immediate fear for his life, except
from a savage whose son he had killed, and from whom
Opechankanough protected him. One line indeed occurs to
the effect that they fed him so fat as to make him much doubt
they meant to sacrifice him; and this paragraph furnishes the
most striking evidence of the kindness of the Indians, and of
the fact that he believed himself to have been mistaken in
having entertained the suspicion. Yet in 1624 we learn that
throughout his long imprisonment he was still expecting every
hour to be put to one death or another.

These variations would be of little consequence to the ordinary
reader of the colonial history, if they stopped at trifling
inconsistencies. They would merely prove, what is almost
self-evident, that the earlier narrative is the safer authority for
historians to follow, and that the confidence which has hitherto
been felt in the exactness of the Generall Historie cannot be
altogether maintained. But there is one particular point in
the text where every American who has heretofore enjoyed
the most favorite story in the early annals of his country will
stop with a feeling of wonder and a desire to doubt the evidence
of his eyes. When he comes to the paragraph in which
the Generall Historie relates the touching story of Pocahontas,
and her intercession at the moment of Smith's extremest peril,
and when he turns to the opposite column of the True Relation
to find its version of the incident, he will surely be
amazed to see not only that it fails to furnish the remotest
allusion to this act, or even by a single word to indicate that
Pocahontas so much as existed, but that it expressly asserts
the remarkable kindness with which Powhatan treated his
captive and assured him at once of his early liberation.

No American needs to learn that this tale of Pocahontas is
probably the most romantic episode in the whole history of his
country. Her name and story are familiar to every schoolboy,
and there are even families whose greatest pride is to
trace their descent from the Emperor's daughter that saved
the life of Captain John Smith. Perhaps this feeling is based
on admiration of the heroism and rare qualities of the Indian
child, though her character as a princess of blood royal may
offer a certain attraction to some of her descendants even in
our own day. In the general enthusiasm, language, and perhaps
common sense, have been a little strained to describe her
attributes. Her beauty and wild grace, her compassion and
disinterestedness, her Christian life and pure character, have
been dwelt upon with warm affection, which is the more natural
as the childhood of the nation has furnished little latitude
to the imagination. One after another, all American historians
have contented themselves with repeating the words of the
Generall Historie, vying with each other in heaping praises
which no critics were cynical enough to gainsay, now on the
virtucs of Pocahontas, and now on the courage and constancy
of Smith.

The unquestioning faith with which this narrative has been
hitherto received is well shown by a quotation from the work
which ranks as the standard authority for American history.
In the early editions of Mr. Bancroft's "History of the
United States," we read the following version of Smith's
adventure :---

>The gentle feelings of humanity are the same in every race, and
in every period of life; they bloom, though unconsciously, even in
the bosom of a child. Smith had easily won the confiding fondness
of the Indian maiden; and now, the impulse of mercy awakened
within her breast, she clung firmly to his neck, as his head was
bowed to receive the strokes of the tomahawk. Did the childlike
superstition of her kindred reverence her interference as a token
from a superior power? Her fearlessness and her entreaties persuaded
the council to spare the agreeable stranger, who might make
hatchets for her father, and rattles and strings of beads for herself,
the favorite child. The barbarians, whose decision had long been
held in suspense by the mysterious awe which Smith had inspired,
now resolved to receive him as a friend, and to make him a partner
of their councils. They tempted him to join their bands, and lend
assistance in an attack upon the white men at Jamestown; and when
his decision of character succeeded in changing the current of their
thoughts, they dismissed him with mutual promises of friendship and
benevolence.

In a note appended to these paragraphs the author
quotes:---

>Smith, I. 158--162, and II. 29--33. The account is fully contained
in the oldest book printed on Virginia, in our Cambridge
library. It is a thin quarto, in black-letter, by John Smith, printed
in 1608,--- A True Relation, &c.

One sees at a glance that the story, in passing through the
medium of Mr. Bancroft's mind, has gained something which
did not belong to the original, or belonged to it only in a
modified degree. The spirit of Smith has infused itself into
the modern historian, as it had already infused itself into
the works of his predecessors. The lights are intensified; the
shadows deepened; the gradations softened; the copy surpasses
its model. This tendency is carried so far that the
author quotes the True Relation as the full authority for what
is only to be found in the Generall Historie, if indeed it is all
to be found even there. When Mr. Bancroft made the careful
collation of his own version of the story with the black-letter
pamphlet in the Cambridge library, the brilliant popular reputation
of Smith had already created an illusion in his mind
resembling the optical effect of refracted light. He saw something
which did not exist, the exaggerated image of a figure
beyond.

No one, however, has now a right to triumph over the
error. The time has gone by when the mistake contained in
this note could be made use of to point any attack upon the
merits of Mr. Bancroft's work, or upon the soundness of his
study; he has himself corrected his own blunder, and in his
last editions, since 1860, another note has been substituted in
the place of the one already quoted. It stands at present as
follows:---

>The rescue of Smith by Pocahontas was told with authority in
1617, in Smith's 'Relation to Queen Anne'; Historie, 127. It is
confirmed in his New England's Trials, printed in 1622; and the full
narrative is to be found in the Historie, printed in 1624. In 1625,
Purchas, who had many manuscripts on Virginia, gives the narrative
a place in his Pilgrims, as unquestionably authentic. Compare
Deane's note on Wingfield, 31, 32.

From a critical point of view, this statement of the case
may be open to objection as well as the other. If it is to
be understood as a defence of Smith, strict critical justice
would require that the existence of some accusation should be
mentioned, its nature noticed, and its authority given. If it
is not intended as a defence, but merely indicates a doubt in
the author's own mind, which he wishes to place with its corrective
before his readers, without laying too much stress upon
it, exact accuracy demands a softening in the assertion of
facts. It is unfortunate, too, that, as the note now stands,
the ordinary reader, who is not directed to the Archæologia
Americana, may be led to suppose that Mr. Deane, whose
edition of Wingfield seems to have caused the alteration, is
referred to in support of Smith and of Mr. Bancroft. But it
is no part of our purpose to dwell upon these small and of
course accidental mistakes, which would not have been worth
mentioning except to illustrate the tyrannical sway still exercised
by Smith over the intelligence of the country.

The quiet investigations of Mr. Deane have, however, now
made it necessary for historians to meet this difficulty. They
must either rely upon the testimony of Smith concerning matters
of his own personal experience, and upon the prescription
of two centuries in favor of his story, or, rejecting the authority
hitherto considered unquestionable, they must undertake
the reconstruction of this whole history out of original material
hitherto considered as merely auxiliary to Smith's narrative.
Unfortunately, there is no possibility of compromise in
the dispute. Cautious as the expressions of Mr. Deane are,
and unwilling as he evidently is to treat the reputation of
Smith with harshness, it is still perfectly clear that the statements
of the Generall Historie, if proved to be untrue, are
falsehoods of a rare effrontery.

The argument against the Generall Historie does not rest,
however, upon the text of the True Relation alone. Properly
speaking, this is only the cause of a discussion which has
rapidly spread itself over the whole field of contemporaneous
history. Even Mr. Deane's publications do not yet quite
cover all the disputed ground, and probably future students
will be able to throw fresh light upon the question from
sources now unknown.

The original Virginia Colony was so incongruous in composition,
its sufferings were so severe, and its disasters so frequent,
that in the course of a very few years several entirely
different classes of men came upon the scene, and each to some
extent effaced the memory of its predecessor. Of these, many
leaders besides Smith have left records of more or less interest,
though the most important of all, the papers of the
Company itself, are mostly lost. It is even a considerable undertaking
to go through the mass of these documents, and to
cull out the isolated passages which bear upon the point now
in dispute; but here we have fortunately the assistance of Mr.
Deane's notes, which leave little to be desired.

It has already been mentioned that the first President of the
Colony was Edward Maria Wingfield, who, in September, 1607,
was deprived of his office and placed in confinement by Smith,
and the other members of the Council. When Newport ---
who, with a new company of settlers, arrived at Jamestown on
the 8th of January, 1608, immediately after Smith's release
--- set out on his second return voyage to London, he took the
deposed President Wingfield with him, and they arrived safely
at Blackwall on the 21st of May. Wingfield appears to have
kept a sort of a diary during his stay in Virginia, and after his
return he wrote with its assistance a defence of himself and
his administration, which seems to have been privately circulated
in manuscript, and at a later period used by Purchas, but
afterwards was forgotten and hidden in the dust of the Lambeth
Library. From this obscurity it was at length drawn by Mr.
Deane, who published a copy of it with notes in the fourth
volume of the Archæologia Americana in 1860. Excepting a
few papers of little consequence, this is the earliest known
writing which comes directly from the Colony. The manuscript
of Smith's True Relation, which is its only possible
rival, could not have reached England before the month of July,
while the Discourse appears to have been intended for immediate
circulation in May or June. Wingfield's work, which is
called "A Discourse of Virginia," is therefore a new authority
on the early history of the Colony, and has peculiar value as
a means of testing the correctness of the True Relation, and
as furnishing some idea of what was thought and said by the
party jealous of Smith's influence. Its account of Smith's
captivity could only have been gained from his own mouth, or
from those to whom he told the story, and the more accurate
it is, the closer it should coincide with the True Relation.

There are a number of passages in this short pamphlet
which would be well worth extracting; but the question as to
Smith's veracity had for the present best be narrowed to the
evidence in regard to Pocahontas, and we will only quote the
passage from Wingfield which tells of Smith's adventures
among the Indians.

>Dec. The 10th of December, Mr. Smith went up the ryver of
>the Chechohomynies to trade for corne. He was desirous to see the
>heade of that river; and when it was not passible with the shallop,
>he hired a cannow and an Indian to carry him up further. The
>river the higher grew worse and worse. Then he went on shoare
>with his guide and left Robinson and Emmery, twoe of our men in
>the cannow; which were presently slaine by the Indians, Pamaonke's
>men, and he himself taken prysoner; and by the means of his
>guide his lief was saved; and Pamaonché haveing him prisoner,
>carryed him to his neybors wyroances to see if any of them knewe
>him for one of those which had bene, some two or three yeres before
>us, in a river amongst them Northward, and taken awaie some
>Indians from them by force. At last he brought him to the great
>Powaton (of whome before wee had no knowledg) who sent him
>home to our towne the viiith of January. ...
>
>Mr. Archer sought how to call Mr. Smith's lief in question and
>had indited him upon a chapter in Leviticus for the death of his twoe
>men. He had had his tryall the same daie of his retorne, and I believe
>his hanging the same or the next daie, so speedie is our law
>there. But it pleased God to send Captn. Newport unto us the
>same evening to our unspeakable comfort, whose arrivall saved Mr.
>Smyth's life and mine.

Mr. Deane, in editing this work of Wingfield's, in 1860, furnished
a note upon this passage, in which for the first time, so
far as we are aware, a doubt was thrown upon the story of
Pocahontas's intervention. Yet the discovery of Wingfield's
narrative adds little to the evidence contained in the True
Relation, which has always been a well-known work. From
the Discourse we learn few new facts. It supplies precise
dates, fixing Smith's departure on the 10th of December, and
his return on the 8th of January, so that we now know that
his absence was exactly four weeks in length. It says that
Smith's guide saved his life, which may or may not be a variation
from the story of the True Relation. It states rather
raore strongly the danger Smith ran from the enmity of
Archer, which may perhaps have been only the result of Wingfield's
own dislike of that person. But, in general, this new
piece of evidence, though clearly independent of the True
Relation, confirms it in all essential points, and especially in
the entire omission of any reference to Pocahontas. It is
highly improbable that so remarkable an incident as her protection
of Smith, if known to Wingfield, should not have been
mentioned in this narrative, which, it may fairly be assumed,
contained the current version of Smith's adventures, as told
among the colonists after his return to Jamestown.

These two works are the only actually contemporaneous authority
for the events of the first year of the colonial history.
There is a wide gap between them and the next work from
which we can quote; and indeed the strength of Mr. Deane's
case rests so largely on the negative evidence offered by the
True Relation and the Discourse, that for his purpose it was
scarcely necessary to go further. Every one, whether believing
or disbelieving the Generall Historie, must agree that Pocahontas
was not mentioned, either by name or by implication,
in the account given of Smith's captivity, either in the True
Relation or in Wingfield's Discourse. If the matter in dispute
were of little consequence, the inquiry might stop here, and
each reader might be left to form his own opinion as to the
truth, or the relative value as authority, of the conflicting
narratives. But the interest of the question requires an exhaustive
statement. We shall therefore return to the history
of Smith and of the Colony, which has been interrupted for
the purpose of explaining the difficulty which the publications
of Mr. Deane have raised.

Newport returned to England on the 10th of April, 1608,
carrying Wingfield with him, and leaving Ratcliffe President
of the Colony, with Martin, Smith, and Archer in the Council,
together with a new member, Matthew Scrivener, who had
arrived with Newport. Smith in June explored successfully a
part of Chesapeake Bay, and, returning on the 21st of July,
found, according to the Generall Historie, the colonists in a
miserable condition, unable to do anything but complain of
Ratcliffe, whose principal offence appears to have been his
obliging the colonists to build him "an unnecessary building
for his pleasure in the woods." Ratcliffe, whose real name was
Sicklemore, appears to have been really a poor creature, if the
evidence in regard to him can be believed. He was now deposed,
and Scrivener, Smith's "deare friend," though then
exceedingly ill, succeeded him as President. This revolution
was rapidly effected; for three days later, on the 24th of July,
Smith again set out, with twelve men, to finish his explorations,
and made a complete tour round the bay, which supplied his
materials for the map published at Oxford in 1612. He did
not return to Jamestown till the 7th of September, and on the
10th assumed the Presidency, "by the Election of the Councell,
and request of the Company." Scrivener appears merely
to have held the office during Smith's pleasure, and voluntarily
resigned it into his hands.

The history of Smith's administration of the Colony from
the 10th of September, 1608, till the end of September, 1609, is
given in the Generall Historie, and may be studied with great
advantage as an example of Smith's style. It abounds in
praise of the President, combined with vigorous attacks upon
every one else, from the authorities in England down to the
laborers at Jamestown. We will not even try to draw a line
between truth and fiction in this part of his story. Whatever
may have been the merits of his government, it is certain that
he had no better success than his predecessors, and that he not
only failed to command obedience, but that he was left almost
or quite without a friend. He was ultimately deposed and sent
to England under articles of complaint. The precise tenor
of these articles is unknown; but the indefatigable Mr. Deane
has unearthed in the Colonial Office a letter of Ratcliffe, alias
Sicklemore, dated 4th October, 1609, in which he announces
to the Lord Treasurer that "this man \[Smith\] is sent home to
answere some misdemeanors whereof I perswade me he can
scarcely clear himselfe from great imputation of blame." Beyond
a doubt, the difficulties of the situation were very great,
and the men Smith had to control were originally poor material,
and were made desperate by their trials; but it is equally
certain that his career in Virginia terminated disastrously, both
for himself and for the settlement. The Virginia Company,
notwithstanding his applications, never consented to employ
him again.

The Colony went on from bad to worse. George Percy, a
brother of the Earl of Northumberland, succeeded Smith in
the Presidency. The condition of the colonists between
Smith's departure in October, 1609, and the arrival of Sir
Thomas Gates, in May, 1610, was terrible. Percy "was so
sicke hee could neither goe nor stand." Ratcliffe, with a number
of others, was killed by Indians. The remainder fed on
roots, acorns, fish, and actually on the savages whom they
killed, and on each other, one man murdering his wife and
eating her. Out of the whole number, said to have been five
hundred, not more than sixty were living when Gates arrived;
and that the situation was beyond hope is proved by the fact
that Gates immediately took them on board ship, and, abandoning
Jamestown, set sail for England. It was only an
accident that they fell in with a new expedition under Lord
Delaware at the mouth of the river, who brought with him a
year's provisions, and restored the fortunes of the settlement.
In spite of the discouragement produced in England by the
news of these disasters, the Company renewed its efforts, and
again sent out Sir Thomas Gates with six vessels and three
hundred men, who arrived in August, 1611. The government
was now in the hands of Sir Thomas Dale, who had assumed
it in May, 1611, and retained it till 1616. If the ultimate
success of the Colony was due to any single man, the merit
appears to belong to Dale; for his severe and despotic rule
crushed the insubordination that had been the curse of the
state, compelled the idle to work, and maintained order between
the colonists and the Indians. But whatever were the
merits or the faults of the government subsequent to the
abandonment of Jamestown and the practical destruction of
the first colony in May, 1610, it is indisputable that previous
to that time nothing could have been worse than the management
of the settlement; and it is evident that the horrors of
the winter of 1609--10 must have had their causes in the
misfortunes, or the mistakes, or the incompetency of Wingfield,
Rateliffe, and Smith. That the colonists, after so long a trial,
were still dependent for their bread on the Indians and on
supplies from England, could searcely have been the fault of
any but themselves, and could not be excused by throwing the
blame of their improvidence upon the distant board of directors
in London.

In the mean while Smith, who had taken his final leave of
the Colony, appears to have led a quiet life in London during
several years. But he was not a man to be crushed by any
disaster. The point in Smith's character which really commands
admiration, although it habitually caused him to neglect
his nearer duties, is the spirit of adventure which nothing could
quench, and the energy in action which often overtasked his
resources and caused his disasters. Although we lose sight
of him during the years 1610 and 1611, we again find him in
1612 busied in the same direction as before. In this year he
published at Oxford a short work called "A Map of Virginia.
With a Description of the countrey, the Commodities, People,
Government, and Religion. Written by Captaine Smith, sometimes
Governour of the Countrey. Whereunto is annexed the
proceedings of those Colonies &c. by W. S." This latter part
of the publication, which purports to be drawn from the
writings of certain colonists, was afterwards reprinted, with
alterations, as the Third Book of the Generall Historic, from
the title of which it appears that W. S. stood for the initials
of one William Simons, Doctor of Divinity.

There is in the text of this tract only one passage bearing
upon the point now principally in dispute. Among the customs
which he describes as peculiar to the Indians was the
form of execution practised against criminals. Their heads,
he says, were placed upon an altar, or sacrificing-stone, while
"one with clubbes beates out their braines." During his captivity,
he adds, not indeed that he had actually seen this mode
of execution, but that an Indian had been beaten in his presence
till he fell senseless, without a cry or complaint. Here
is, therefore, the whole idea of the story which he afterwards
made public. Practised lawyers may decide whether, under
the ordinary rules of evidence, this passage amounts to a positive
implication that he had himself not been placed in the
position described, or it may perhaps be possible for future
students to explain why Smith should have suppressed his own
story, supposing it to have been true. The inference is very
strong that, if anything of the sort had ever occurred, it
would certainly have been mentioned here, and this argument
is considerably strengthened by a short narration of the facts
of his imprisonment, given in the second part of the pamphlet,
for which Dr. Simons is the nominal authority. This
version is as follows:---

>A month those barbarians kept him prisoner, many strange triumphs
and conjurations they made of him, yet he so demeened himself
amongst them as he not only diverted them from surprising
the fort, but procured his own liberty, and got himself and his company
such estimation among them that those savages admired him
as a Demi God. So returning safe to the Fort, once more stayed the
pinnace her flight for England.

This work was, as above stated, afterwards reprinted,
under the author's name, as the Third Book of the Generall
Historie. The passage just quoted is there reproduced with
the evidently intentional substitution of "six or seven weekes"
for "a month," as in the original. In the Generall Historie
the concluding paragraph is omitted, and in its place stands,
--- "The manner how they used and delivered him, is as followeth."
And then, breaking abruptly into the middle of the
old narrative, the story which has been quoted at such length
was interpolated.

The narrative in the second part of the Map of Virginia,
of which the above extract forms a part, is signed by the name
of Thomas Studley alone, while in the Generall Historie the
enlarged account bears also the signatures of Edward Harrington,
Robert Fenton, and Smith himself. A question may
arise as to the extent to which these persons should be considered
as dividing with Smith the responsibility for the story.
Thomas Studley, however, died on the 28th of August, 1607.
Both he and Edward Harrington had lain four months in their
graves before Smith ever had heard of Powhatan or Pocahontas.
The date of Robert Fenton's death is not so clear, but there
is no reason to suppose that he had any share in the narration
of events which Smith alone witnessed.

The argument so far as the Oxford tract is concerned would
therefore seem to be strong enough, even if it went no further.
But it becomes irresistible when we find that this tract not
only mentions Pocahontas, but actually introduces her in the
_rôle_ of guardian angel and saviour of Smith's life, although it
says no word of her most famous act in this character. The
allusion occurs towards the end of the pamphlet, where the
assumed writer takes occasion to defend Smith against certain
charges, one of them being an alleged scheme on his part of
marrying Powhatan's daughter Pocahontas in order to acquire
a claim to the throne. The writer denies the charge, and
adds:---

>It is true she was the very nonparell of his kingdome and at
most not past 13 or 14 yeares of age. Very often shee came to our
fort with what shee could get for Captaine Smith, that ever loved
and used all the countrie well, but her especially he ever much respected
and she so well requited it that when her father intended
to have surprised him, shee by stealth in the darke night came
through the wild woods and told him of it.

This Oxford tract of 1612 may be considered as decisive of
the fact that, down to that date, the story of Pocahontas had
not been made public. We are obliged to confess that no
explanation whatever, consistent with an assumption of the
truth of the later narrative, occurs to the mind to account
for Smith's continued silence so long after his connection with
the Colony had ceased.

Here we take leave of Smith, as an authority, for a period
of some ten years, during which he published but one work,
not relating to the present subject. But an entirely new class
of colonists had, in 1610 and 1611, taken the place of the
first settlers, almost exterminated by the disasters of 1609 - 10.
Among the new-comers there arrived in the train of Lord
Delaware, in 1610, a certain William Strachey, who held the
office of Secretary of the Colony. Little is known of Strachey,
except that, after his return to England, he compiled a work
called the "Historie of Travaile into Virginia," never completed
in its original plan, but still extant in two neatly written
manuscripts, and printed by the Hakluyt Society in 1849.
The date of its composition was probably about the year 1615.
It consists largely of extracts from Smith's previous works,
though without acknowledgment of their origin; but it also
contains original matter, and especially some curious references
to Pocahontas. (See Deane's edition of the True Relation,
p. 72.) There is, however, no reference, direct or indirect, to
her agency in saving Smith's life, and no trace of the high
esteem which such an act would have won for her.

Next in order after Strachey's manuscript, we have a work
which is quite original, and which gives, perhaps, the best account
of the Colony ever made public by an eye-witness. This
is a small volume in quarto, printed in London in 1615, and
called "A True Discourse of the Present Estate of Virginia
... till the 18th of June, 1614, together with . ... the
Christening of Powhatan's daughter and her Marriage with an
Englishman. Written by Raphe Hamor, late Secretarie in
the Colonie." In it we find a minute and graphic story how
"Pocahuntas, King Powhatan's daughter, whose fame has
spread even to England under the name of Non Parella,"
while staying with some tribe, subject to her father, on the
Potomac, was seized and carried away by Captain Argol, who
had sailed up that river on a trading expedition. Her imprisonment
as a hostage at Jamestown, her visit to her father's
residence with Sir Thomas Dale and a strong force of English,
Powhatan's failure to redeem her, and her subsequent marriage
to John Rolfe, on the 5th of April, 1613, are all circumstantially
narrated; and finally an extremely interesting account
is given of a visit which Hamor made to Powhatan, and of the
conversation he had with that extraordinary savage. Besides
this work of Hamor, the volume also contains several letters
from persons in Virginia, one of which is by John Rolfe himself,
written with the single object of justifying his marriage.
Afterwards, when the arrival of Pocahontas in England had
excited an interest throughout Europe in her story, Hamor's
book was translated and published in Germany.

Although there are repeated allusions to Pocahontas in the
works already mentioned, it is in Hamor that she makes, for
the first time, her appearance as a person of political importance.
In the True Relation, Smith represented her as a
pretty and clever child of ten years old, who was once sent
with a trusted messenger by Powhatan to the fort to entreat
the liberation of some Indians whom Smith had seized. The
Oxford tract mentions her as a friend of Smith's, but a mere
child. Strachey gives a curious description of her intimate
relations with the Colony during his residence there. "Pocahuntas,
a well featured but wanton yong girle, Powhatan's
daughter, sometymes resorting to our fort, of the age then of
eleven or twelve yeares, would get the boyes forth with her
into the markett place, and make them wheele, falling on their
hands, turning up their heeles upwards, whome she would followe
and wheele so her self, naked as she was, all the fort
over." All this seems to indicate that she was considered
merely as a child, whose age made her a general favorite.
But from the time when Argol treacherously seized her, she
occupied an important position, in the first place as the guaranty
of a peace which Powhatan promised, and seems to have
faithfully preserved during the remainder of her life and of his
own; in the second place as a person well calculated to excite
interest in England in behalf of the Colony; and, finally, as
an eminent convert to the English Church, through whom a
powerful religious influence might, it was believed, be exercised
among her father's subjects. Hamor's book is filled with
her history, and Rolfe's letter shows much anxiety to prove
the propriety of his course in marrying her. Both writers
were interested in exciting as much sympathy for her as could
be roused. Yet neither the one nor the other alludes in any
mammer to the act which has since become her first claim to
praise, and in the light of which the rest of her story has been
almost thrown out of sight. There is no reason to suppose
that in Virginia at this time the persons best informed were
yet aware that Pocahontas had ever saved Smith's life.

In the month of June, 1616, Sir Thomas Dale arrived at
Plymouth, on his return home, bringing with him, among his
suite, the baptized Pocahontas, now called Rebecca Rolfe, who,
with her husband and child, came at the charge of the Company
to visit England, and to prove to the world the success
of the Colony. She became at once the object of extraordinary
attention, and in the following winter she was the most
distinguished person in society. Her portrait, taken at this
time, still exists, and shows a somewhat hard-featured figure,
with a tall hat and ruff, appearing ill at ease in the stiff and
ungraceful fashions of the day. Gentlemen of the court sent
the engraving, as the curiosity of the season, in their letters
to correspondents abroad. The Church received her with great
honor, and the Bishop of London gave her an entertainment,
celebrated in enthusiastic terms by Purchas. At the court
masque, in January, 1617, she was among the most conspicuous
guests. The king and queen actually received her in
special audiences; and to crown all, tradition reports, with
reasonable foundation, that King James, in his zeal for the
high principles of divine right and the sacred character of
royalty, expressed his serious displeasure that Rolfe, who was
at best a simple gentleman, should have ventured so far beyond
his position as to ally himself with one who was of
imperial blood.

Just at this time, when the influence of London society had
set its only too decisive stamp of fashion on the name of the
Indian girl, and when King James had adopted her as rightfully
belonging within the pale of the divinity that hedges a
king,--- just at this moment Samuel Purchas, "Parson of St.
Martin's by Ludgate," published the third edition of his "Pilgrimage."
The excellent Purchas, although not himself an
explorer, was an enthusiast on the subject of travels and
adventures, and in compiling the collection which is now so
eagerly sought and so highly valued by collectors of books he
had, so far as related to Virginia, the direct assistance of personal
witnesses, and also of manuscripts now unhappily lost
except for his extracts. He was well acquainted with Smith,
who "gently communicated" his notes to him, and who was
now in London, and visited Pocahontas at Brentford. Purchas
himself saw Pocahontas. He was present when "my Hon^ble^.
and Rev^d.^ Patron the Lord Bishop of London, Dr King, entertained
her with festivall state and pompe beyond what I
have seen in his great hospitalitie afforded to other ladies," in
his "hopefull zeale by her to advance Christianitie." He knew
Tomocomo, an Indian of Powhatan's tribe, who came with her
to England. "With this savage I have often conversed at my
good friend's Master Doctor Goldstone, where he was a frequent
guest; and where I have both seen him sing and dance
his diabolicall measures and heard him discourse of his countrey
and religion, Sir Thomas Dale's man being the interpretour."
He knew Rolfe also, who lent him his manuscript
discourse on Virginia. Yet in Purchas's book no allusion can
be found to the heroic intervention on behalf of Smith, the
story of whose captivity is simply copied from Simons's quarto
of 1612; the diffuse comments on men and manners in Virginia
contain no trace of what would have been correctly
regarded as the most extraordinary incident in colonial history.

Silence in a single instance, as in Wingfield or in Strachey,
might be accounted for, or, at all events, might be overlooked.
But in the course of this examination we have found silence
absolute during a long period of years and under the most
improbable circumstances. Wingfield, Smith himself, Simons,
Strachey, Hamor, Rolfe, and Purchas, all the authorities, without
exception, known to exist, are equally dumb when questioned
as to a circumstance which, since 1624, has become the
most famous part of colonial history. The field is literally
exhausted. There exist no other sources from which to draw authentic
information. Nothing remains but to return to Smith,
and to inquire when it was that this extraordinary story first
made its appearance, and how it obtained authority.

The blaze of fashionable success that surrounded Pocahontas
in London lights up the closing scene of her life. It is
said that she was obliged, against her will, to set out on her
return to Virginia, but she never actually left the shores of
England. Detained in the Thames by several weeks of contrary
winds, her failing strength altogether gave way; and in
March, 1617, in the poor word-play of Purchas, "she came at
Gravesend to her end and grave." Her father, Powhatan, survived
her less than a year.

Smith, in the mean while, was busied with projects in regard
to New England and the fisheries. His efforts to form a colony
there and to create a regular system of trade had very
little success; but to spread a knowledge of the new country
among the people of England, he printed, in 1616, a small
quarto, called "A Description of New England," and in 1620
he published another pamphlet, entitled "New England's
Trials," a second and enlarged edition of which appeared in 1622. Here, at last, in 1622, we find the long-sought allusion
to his captivity, in the following words :---

>For wronging a soldier but the value of a penny I have caused
Powhatan send his own men to Jamestowne to receive their punishment
at my discretion. It is true in our greatest extremitie they
shot me, slue three of my men, and by the folly of them that fled,
took me prisoner; yet God made Pocahontas the King's daughter
the means to deliver me; and thereby taught me to know their
treacheries to preserve the rest.

This in order of time is the third version given by Smith
of his own adventure, the account in the Generall Historie
being the fourth. Each of these four stories is more or less
inconsistent with all the others; but this of 1622 is, we are
sorry to say it, more certainly mendacious than any of the
rest. Read it in whatever light we please, it is creditable neither
to Smith's veracity nor to his sense of honor. "By the
folly of them that fled," he now states that the Indians succeeded
in capturing him. All the other versions agree in this,
that at the time Sınith was attacked and his two men slain he
was quite alone, except for his Indian guide, whom he used as
a shield. To throw upon the invented cowardice of companions
who were far away, out of sight and out of hearing of the
contest, the blame for a disaster which was solely due to his
own over-boldness, was not an honorable way of dealing with
his command. Perhaps it would be better to leave this point
unnoticed, in deference to Smith's real merits, but unfortunately
this is not the only passage in his works in which the
same tendency is apparent.

Nevertheless, the fact remains, that here for the first time
the story of Pocahontas appears in print. "God made Pocahontas
the means to deliver me." The devout form is characteristic
of the age, though the piety of a man like Smith, if
his autobiography gives a true idea of his course of life, must
have been a curious subject for study. But for those who
assume, with Mr. Deane, that the agency of Pocahontas is a
pure invention, this paragraph becomes doubly interesting, as
showing to what a degree of quaint dignity the Elizabethan
age could rise, even in falsehood.

The first appearance of this famous story can therefore be
fixed with sufficient certainty within five years between 1617
and 1622, although the published account in all its completeness
is only to be found in the Generall Historie, printed in
1624, from which such copious extracts have already been
quoted as to make any further allusion unnecessary. There
remains only one point of difficulty requiring attention in this
work.

Smith has there stated (pp. 121 123) that, when l'ocahontas
came to England, he wrote for her a sort of letter of introduction
to the Queen, or, in his own words, "a little booke to
this effect to the Queen, an abstract whereof followeth."

>Some ten yeeres agoe, being in Virginia and taken prisoner by
the power of Powhatan their chiefe King. ... I cannot say I felt
the least occasion of want that was in the power of those my mortall
foes to prevent, notwithstanding al their threats. After some
six weeks fatting amongst those Salvage Courtiers, at the minute of
my execution, she hazarded the beating out of her owne braines to
save mine, and not onely that, but so prevailed with her father, that
I was safely conducted to Jamestowne.

If Smith really wrote this statement to the Queen, and the
Queen received the letter, the case unquestionably becomes
even more complicated than before. But the fact is, that the
letter itself rests on the authority of the Generall Historie,
and has neither more nor less weight than the other statements
in that work. It is by no means necessary to believe
that this "abstract of the effect" of the little book is freer
from interpolations than the text of the Generall Historie
elsewhere. At the time it was published, in 1624, not only
had Pocahontas long been dead, but Queen Anne herself had,
in 1619, followed her to the grave, and Smith remained alone
to tell his own story. The Virginia Company certainly had
no interest in denying the truth of a story so admirably calculated
to draw popular sympathy towards the Colony. But
even if it be granted that Smith's letter as it stands was really
sent to the Queen, the argument against its truth, so far as it
is based on the silence of all previous authorities, is left quite
untouched; and if there is no conclusive evidence to prove
that the story was unknown in 1617, it is at least equally difficult
to prove that, if known, it was believed. Smith's character
was certainly a matter of warm dispute in his own day,
and his enemies seem to have been too numerous and strong
for even his energy and perseverance to overcome. No more
decisive witness on this point is needed than Thomas Fuller,
himself one of Smith's contemporaries, whose "Worthies of
England" first appeared some thirty years after Smith's death,
when the civil wars had intervened to obliterate the recollection
of all personal jealousies, and when Smith himself
must have been almost as little remembered as he is to-day.
Fuller devotes a page to his history in the following vein:---

>From the Turks in Europe he passed to the Pagans in America
where, towards the latter end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, such
his perils, preservations, dangers, deliverances, they seem to most
men above belief, to some beyond truth. Yet have we two witnesses
to attest them, the prose and the pictures, both in his own book;
and it soundeth much to the diminution of his deeds that he alone
is the herald to publish and proclaim them.

The essential evidence on each side of this curious question
has now been exhausted, although it would be easy to argue
indefinitely in regard to Smith's general character. This must
indeed be done by the first historian who attempts again to
deal with the history of the Virginia Colony. But although
the argument has been stated fairly, and may now be left for
future and final judgment, some reasonably clear theory is
still required to explain the existence of the story now assumed
to be false. If Mr. Deane had departed a little farther
than he has done from his sphere of work as an editor, and
given the result of his studies in a more general form, his
deep acquaintance with the subject would have made his conclusions
particularly valuable. As it is, he, like Dr. Palfrey,
only hints that Smith, in the latter part of his life, had fallen
into the hands of hack-writers, who adapted his story for popular
effect. Perhaps, if we may venture to guess at his real
opinion, the view he would be inclined to take might be somewhat
as follows.

The examination of Smith's works has shown that his final
narrative was the result of gradual additions. The influence
exercised by Pocahontas on the affairs of the Colony, according
to the account given in 1608, was very slight. In 1612 she
first appears in her heroic character. Her capture and her marriage
to Rolfe gave her importance. Her visit to England,
however, made her beyond question the most conspicuous figure
in Virginia, and it became inevitable that romantic incidents
in her life would be created, if they did not already
exist, by the mere exercise of the popular imagination, attracted
by a wild and vigorous picture of savage life.

The history of the emperor's daughter became, as we are
led by Smith to suppose, a subject for the stage. Nothing
was more natural or more probable. It is not even necessary
to assume that Smith himself invented the additions to his
original story. He may have merely accepted them after they
had obtained a strong and general hold on the minds of his
contemporaries.

In the mean while Smith's own career had failed, and his
ventures ended disastrously, while in most cases he did not
obtain the employment which he continued to seek with unrelaxed
energy. In 1622, however, a great disaster occurred in
Virginia, which roused the greatest interest and sympathy in
England, and gave occasion for renewed efforts in behalf of the
Colony. The Indians rose against the English, and in the
month of May a terrible massacre took place around Jamestown.
The opportunity was not one to be lost by a man who,
like Smith, while burning to act, was still smarting under
what he considered undeserved neglect, and he at once hastened
to offer his services to the Company, with a plan for
restoring peace; but his plan and his offer of services were
again declined. Still, the resource of which he had already
made such frequent use remained, and by publishing the Generall
Historie he made a more ambitious appeal to the public
than any he had yet attempted. In this work he embodied
everything that could tend to the increase of his own reputation,
and drew material from every source which could illustrate
the history of English colonization. Pocahontas was
made to appear in it as a kind of stage deity on every possible
occasion, and his own share in the affairs of the Colony is magnified
at the expense of all his companions. None of those
whose reputations he treated with so much harshness appeared
to vindicate their own characters, far less to assert the facts in
regard to Pocahontas. The effort indeed failed of its object,
for he remained unemployed and without mark of distinction.
"He led his old age in London, where his having a Prince's
mind imprisoned in a poor man's purse rendered him to the
contempt of such who were not ingenuous. Yet he efforted
his spirits with the remembrance and relation of what formerly
he had been and what he had done." So Fuller writes, who
might have known him in his later years. He died quietly in
his bed, in London, in June, 1631; his will is extant, and has
been published by Mr. Deane, but furnishes little new information;
in the absence of criticism, due perhaps to the political
excitement of the times, his book survived to become the
standard authority on Virginian history. The readiness with
which it was received is scarcely so remarkable as the credulity
which has left it unquestioned almost to the present day.
