# British Finance in 1816[^/269]

Lord Liverpool's administration, at the close of the
great French war, contained perhaps not a single member
endowed with less originating power than Mr. Vansittart,
the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The twenty-three years
during which that struggle had raged almost without intermission
had seen many men in succession attempting, after
their own fashion, to sustain the enormous and rapidly increasing
burden under which the resources of England were
strained to exhaustion. Mr. Pitt, who, in spite of all that may
be said, was great as a finance minister, even in his errors, Mr.
Addington, Lord Henry Petty, and Mr. Spencer Perceval had,
one after another, tried their ingenuity, not in restoring order
to the finances, for they all found any such purpose far beyond
their powers, but in holding England back from the brink of
national bankruptcy. When, in 1812, Mr. Perceval was assassinated,
and Lord Liverpool became the First Lord of the Treasury,
it was not supposed that so weak an administration could
long sustain the weight of the public interests; and Mr. Vansittart
seems to have been placed at the head of the Exchequer
rather in the expectation that the position would not be
permanent, than with any idea that he might become the most
important member of the government. Nominally, indeed,
the financial policy of the country was under the control of
the Prime Minister, and the whole administration was responsible
for its direction. But Lord Liverpool was himself not a
great man, and Lord Castlereagh, whose ability was really considerable,
gave, as could scarcely have been otherwise, his
whole attention to his own department of foreign affairs. Nevertheless,
weak as it was in 1812, this administration brought
the war to its conclusion, placing Great Britain in a position
more powerful and commanding than she ever had held before,
or probably will ever hold again. But the close of this long
struggle, and the settlement at last effected by the treaty of
Vienna, changed with great rapidity the task of the English
government. Questions of internal policy sprang into surpassing
interest and prominence; and while Lord Liverpool
and Lord Castlereagh were still occupied in maintaining British
influence on the Continent at the same point to which they
had raised it in 1815, the movement had already begun among
the people, which, fifty years later, ended in the official avowal
of the uselessness and mischief of the traditional foreign
policy of Great Britain.

[^/269]: From the North American Review for April, 1867.

Mr. Vansittart was not a person of so much consequence
that it has been thought worth while to publish his papers;
and we cannot now learn whether he was in any way conscious
of the enormous duties which the close of the war threw upon
him, --- duties which would have overtasked Pitt himself, and
which Huskisson and Peel made the foundation of their great
reputations, while a host of inferior men were buried under
the weight. Even now it is impossible to draw up a clear
statement of the condition of English finances in 1816. It is
impossible to determine with certainty even the simplest of all
the facts, --- the amount of the debt. If, therefore, the following
account of English financial affairs appears unintelligible
to the reader, there is only one consideration to be offered in
its excuse. This account is difficult to understand, and may
contain errors; but there can be no possible doubt that a clear
and positive statement would be quite unworthy of belief.

The Parliamentary Paper No. 443 of the session of 1858
gives an official return of the amount of the public debt of
the United Kingdom for every year since that debt has had
an existence. There is excellent reason to doubt whether the
sums given are in the majority of cases more than approximations
to the truth; but there seems to be no reason to expect
greater exactness from any other source. The following may,
therefore, be assumed as a fair statement of the national debt
of Great Britain in 1816, the first year after the return of
peace.

The nominal capital was, therefore, about eight hundred and
sixty million pounds; and in January, 1816, six months after
Waterloo, the three per cents stood at sixty in the market. It
must, however, be stated at the outset, and always borne in
mind, that the funded debt of Great Britain cannot be rightly
represented by a statement of the nominal amount of capital
supposed to be involved. One nation borrows money, and, by
the terms of the contract, engages to repay the whole sum
lent, and fixes a time for the repayment. Another nation borrows
without the profession of any intention ever to return the
capital at all; and Great Britain's whole funded debt was contracted
in this manner. In technical language, the government
sells annuities, and no purchaser is either in law or in
equity entitled to demand more than his stipulated annual
interest upon the sum which he has lent. No man can ever
claim of right any part of the principal of the public funds.
It is true, however, that there are two sorts of annuities,
which must be clearly distinguished. The perpetual annuities,
to which class the mass of the funds belong, are also called
redeemable, because, whenever they rise above par in the
market, and it becomes profitable to pay them off by borrowing
the money at a lower rate of interest, there is nothing in
the contract which forbids the operation; and accordingly this
has been regularly done, until the whole debt is now consolidated
in three per cents, and may at any time be reduced still
lower, should these rise above par. But the terminable annuities
are not redeemable, and depend on an entirely different
principle.

These terminable annuities are of two kinds, --- those for
lives and those for a term of years. They bear a higher rate
of interest, calculated according to special tables, so that the
life annuities terminate absolutely with the life of the holder,
and the others at some fixed time, according to the specified
terms of the contract. The so-called long annuities, for instance,
were fixed to terminate in 1860. This system of
terminable annuities has, therefore, the advantage of securing
the extinction of the loan at a very moderate annual charge,
so that the tax-payers are unconscious that they are in fact
paying off every year a portion of the capital, as well as the
interest of the debt. This was at one time a favorite scheme
in English finance, and there were several forms of terminable
annuities, the principle of the self-extinguishing character of
the debt remaining the same throughout. Although this plan
of borrowing is accompanied by a higher rate of annual charge
than is necessary when borrowing on a perpetual annuity, it
was usually made very light by granting the annuity for a long
term of years. Thus, an annuity for a hundred years is the
same thing to most persons as an annuity forever; and it is
also nearly the same by calculation, its value at four %
being twenty-four and a half years' purchase, and therefore
only a half-year's purchase less than an annuity forever. It
has been contended that the whole debt ought to have been
contracted in this form, and possibly, if the government had
begun with this purpose in its mind, it might have succeeded;
but in practice the public naturally prefer, where the choice is
given them, the perpetual investment. These terminable annuities
were also objected to, reasonably or not, on the ground
that they encouraged the popular tendency to improvidence.

The unfunded debt, too, is not fairly represented as capital.
Exchequer bills were habitually used to some extent, in anticipation
of revenue that could not be immediately collected.
Far the larger portion, however, was really so much debt,
which had to be ultimately paid off or funded. Large sums
were usually voted upon these bills towards the conclusion of
each session of Parliament, particularly in time of war, to
answer exigencies of the public service.

It is, therefore, the charge of the debt alone which is the
true measure of the liabilities of Great Britain. The same
authority which has been already quoted states this charge to
have been, in 1816, as follows:---

We may begin, therefore, with the assumption, that the
capital of the national debt amounted, in 1816, to the sum
of £861,040,000, bearing an annual burden of £32,645,618.

The regular annual expenses of the government amounted
to nearly the same sum as the charge of the debt. The whole
amount required to be raised by taxation, in the year subsequent
to the war, was about £61,000,000. Many years afterwards,
when the popular cry for economy had exercised its full
power, and circumstances had allowed a considerable reduction
to be effected in the charge for interest of the debt, the annual
expenditure of the country sank so low as £47,000,000; but
the first peace budget was one of more than sixty millions
sterling.

This immense burden was levied on a population which
probably did not exceed twenty million souls; and of this
number fully six millions were Irish. But Ireland was bankrupt.
So bad was her financial condition, that, after every
effort, she found herself unable to meet by taxation even the
charge of her debt. That charge amounted, in 1815, to
£6,370,000; while the net revenue paid into the Irish exchequer
was little more than £5,000,000. It was not to
Ireland that the people of Great Britain could look for the
faintest assistance in the support of their common credit.

There remained a population of fourteen millions in England,
Scotland, and Wales, and of this number it is hardly rash to
say that one half contributed little to the payment of taxes.
The warehouses were choked with goods, for which no market
was to be found. The price of grain had fallen from five and
six pounds sterling the quarter down to two pounds and a half,
bringing distress to every farmer in the kingdom. More than
£6,000,000 were annually raised, by local taxation, for the
support or relief of the poor in England and Wales alone. Under
these circumstances, it seems a liberal allowance to suppose
that the whole weight of an annual taxation of £60,000,000
fell practically upon not more than ten millions of people; and
from these, in 1815, the government had actually succeeded
in grinding £72,000,000. But even allowing that the whole
fourteen millions contributed in just proportion, the burden
of taxation is terrible to consider, when the vast mass of poverty
and pauperism is taken into the account.

The income returns of Great Britain for the year 1815 give
the following result:---

+----------------+-------------:+
| Customs        | £ 10,487,522 |
+----------------+--------------+
| Excise         | £ 26,562,432 |
+----------------+--------------+
| Property Tax   | £ 14,318,572 |
+----------------+--------------+
| Assessed Taxes | £ 6,214,987  |
+----------------+--------------+
| Land Tax       | £ 1,079,993  |
+----------------+--------------+
| Stamps         | £ 5,865,413  |
+----------------+--------------+
| Post-Office    | £ 1,548,000  |
+----------------+--------------+
| Miscellaneous  | £ 366,867    |
+----------------+--------------+
| Total          | £ 66,443,786 |
+----------------+--------------+

To this total, about £5,000,000 is to be added on account
of Ireland, which still had an exchequer, and even a currency,
distinct from that of Great Britain. It must also be mentioned,
that the distinction between customs and excise was
merely nominal, and did not indicate the nature of the taxes.
The transfers from one to the other head seem to have been
arbitrary; and, as the same article frequently paid both an
excise and a customs duty, it was more convenient that one
board should collect the whole.

More than half the revenue was produced by the excise and
customs. It was, therefore, of paramount importance that
these two branches should be carefully fostered, simplified, and
systematized. When Mr. Pitt assumed the control of the
finances, after the American war of independence, he found
the customs in a state of such inextricable confusion, that the
most experienced merchants were unable to foresee what would
be the amount of duty affecting the articles they were importing,
or to know the course to be followed in entering or clearing
their vessels. In the midst of a chaos of contradictory
statutes, irreconcilable systems, and arbitrary regulations, the
inheritance of a century of bad government, the clerks of the
custom-house ruled with supreme authority over the whole
commerce of Great Britain. Among the measures by which
Mr. Pitt gained his right to be considered the greatest of English
administrators, the one which did away with this state of
things was by no means the least in value. In 1787 he succeeded
in carrying through Parliament an act abolishing all
the existing duties, and substituting in their place single duties
on each article, according to a regular tariff, which was still
further assisted by a reform in the method of transacting
business in the custom-house.

But the new system had scarcely produced all its beneficent
results, when the French war broke out; and for twenty-three
years Parliament piled one customs law upon another, until
the old confusion reigned in the custom-house as absolutely as
ever before. The same article paid duty repeatedly,--- now to
the customs, now to the excise. The laws were without a system,
and impossible to class under any imaginable plan. There
were bounties or drawbacks upon half the articles of commerce
or production. Fees were multiplied to excess. Five hundred
different statutes regulated the customs alone. A complete
and vigorous measure was urgently required for the consolidation
of the customs laws; and the example of Mr. Pitt made
the neglect of the step by any subsequent government all the
more obvious and inexcusable.

This, however, was a part of the situation which lay nearest
the light, and was most easily reached. It concerned only the
form of collecting the taxes; and the real difficulties of the
case extended throughout the whole length and breadth of the
system of taxation itself. There seems to have been scarcely
a fragment of the English revenue laws which was not marked
by peculiar faults of its own, besides sharing in the radical
vices that lay at the foundation of almost all of them. The
principal exceptions which modern writers appear to have made
in this sweeping condemnation of the old system are those of
the house and land taxes, and the property or income tax, as
the most economical and the most just that existed. But these
required a degree of reform and alteration which would almost
have converted them into new taxes.

It is unquestionable that the nation, apart from the form
of its burdens, was very much over-taxed. The most ordinary
and necessary articles of consumption were overloaded with
burdens. The case of the salt duties was a notorious example
of this evil. The natural cost of salt was less than eightpence
the bushel, while the law required fifteen shillings on each
bushel, raising its price to about twenty-two times its value.
The same objection ran through most of the excise duties.
This was, however, comparatively a simple difficulty; and
although it needed prompt and effective correction, no very
high intellectual power was required to arrive at the remedy,
so long as the question of protection was not involved.

But it was rare indeed that the question of protection could
at that time be kept out of any projected improvement in
English taxation. Protection coiled like a tangled cord around
and over and through every portion of British finance. The
reformers, who, with no enmity to the long-established principle
of protecting home industry, still wished to relax a little
here and there the strain of taxation, which was tearing the
very muscles out of the bodies of their poorer fellow-countrymen,
tugged now at one projecting evil of the vast system,
and now at another; but wherever they came, they found the
whole mass, confused and chaotic as it was, bound hard and
fast in the inextricable meshes of protection. Some alarmed
interest sprang out of the darkness to cry shame, and to excite
popular hatred against them at the very moment when they
were hoping at last to have found a chance of stirring the
phlegmatic government and the wretchedly indifferent Parliament
into taking a step which could by no possibility harm
any living creature.

Everything was protected. Every petty interest of the
country had its rag of protection, --- not merely against the
genius or activity or superior circumstances of a foreign rival,
but against allied branches of industry at home. Tiles complained
if slates were untaxed. Wool was jealous of cotton.
The brain of the Chancellor of the Exchequer was racked by
hopeless efforts to maintain a proper equilibrium between home
industries, while protecting them all against the foreigner.
The irresistible logic of the principle was really carried out to
that extent from which tamer modern protectionists shrink.
One part of the United Kingdom was protected from the other.
The products of English industry were protected from the
rivalry of Ireland, and the manufactures and produce of Ireland
were only admitted under suitable precautions into England.
It is true, that the policy was, in this particular case,
pursued with somewhat superfluous energy, since not only were
heavy duties exacted for the protection of manufactures which
actually existed in Ireland, but also for that of some which did
not exist at all, and never had existed, and which a moderate
degree of knowledge of the subject would have shown never
could exist; so that the Irish people enjoyed, through a long
series of years, the most favorable of possible opportunities for
observing the operation of a thoroughly efficient protective
system of their own choice.

Nor was this all. Besides the protection granted to each
industry against its neighbor, besides that which built a wall
between the different states of the same empire, and besides
that which guarded them all against the foreigner, the British
system undertook to protect one foreign nation from another;
and this was even regarded as a masterpiece of statesmanship.
A brilliant example of this form of protection was furnished
in the case of Portugal. For an entire century, down to 1831,
the British people were condemned to drink the vintage of
Portugal, in order to protect both countries against the superior
attractions of French wine.

But even as regarded the ordinary and almost universally
accepted practice of protecting home industry against the foreigner,
the system of 1816 was far in advance of the mild conceptions
of 1866. The statesmen of that day shrank from no
consequence of their theory. It was not enough to lay protective
duties of sixty or a hundred % on rival enterprise.
It was not even enough to tax at the rate of fifty % as a manufactured article the very mummies that were
imported from Egypt, lest they should interfere with the British
product. If the principle was good at all, it was held to
be good to the extent of absolute prohibition; and as, on the
one hand, the law required that the Englishman who had been
so unlucky as to die could only go to his grave in a windingsheet
of British woollen, so it was enacted, that any man,
duke or beggar, who might be suspected of wearing or possessing
even a silk handkerchief of foreign manufacture was
liable to have it taken from his neck or his pocket, or to have
his house entered and ransacked from garret to cellar. There
was an element of the most intolerable tyranny inherent in
the very nature of the prohibitive laws.

It might be supposed that difficulties and confusion enough
would have resulted from such a revenue system. But in
point of fact, there was nothing peculiarly strange or remarkable
in it. Similar principles lay at the base of almost every
financial theory at that time, and the countries of Europe, and
even of America, accepted them as their rule of action. It
was here that the British system began to show itself in its
own strength; but it was only when the colonial and navigation
laws were added to the over-taxation and to the eccentricities
of ordinary protection, that confusion became confounded,
and absurdity ran riot in the English statute-book.
The principle which then lay at the bottom of the colonial
system was, that the colonies existed for the benefit of the
mother country; and the successful protest of the North
American Colonies, in their war of independence, had not yet
succeeded in convincing Great Britain of the radical error of
this theory. No ships but British ships could enter the ports
of a British colony, and no market but the English market
was open to the colonists. The West Indian sugar-planter
was obliged to send his produce to England for sale. He might
perhaps have gained something had he refined it before shipment;
but the British refiner would have suffered, and the
British mercantile marine must have the benefit of the bulkier
freight. In return, he was obliged to receive only British
goods, or goods which had passed through Great Britain. But
the West Indian colonies were dependent upon the nearer
ports of the United States for many of the very necessaries
of life; and the negroes died of hunger when those ports were
closed. This necessity of obtaining food was alone the cause
of a slight relaxation in the law, by which a limited trade was
permitted in certain articles, from certain ports, by a certain
class of vessels, with the United States. On the other hand,
if the price of colonial sugar was twice or more than twice
that of the foreign, as was sometimes the case, the British
public was required to pay the additional tax of several millions
sterling annually for the benefit of the colonial system.

The timber trade with the Canadian colonies was a still more
curious example of British protection and its complications.
It was undisputed that the timber of Norway was not only the
easiest to procure and the cheapest, but also much the best in
the market. But the interests of the colonies required protection,
and the British marine was accordingly built of inferior
material. The reformers demanded the abolition of this mischievous
system, and called upon the shipping interest to join
in obtaining its repeal. The ship-owners refused. They resisted
desperately every attempt to reopen the Norway timber
trade; and their argument was, that, as the naval power of
Great Britain demanded a numerous merchant marine as its
basis, and as the timber trade with Canada supplied an enormously
bulky freight, and required long and frequent voyages,
it would be a violation of the very first principles of British
policy to allow their ships to be built of the best timber. The
liberal members of Parliament, irritated at this extravagant
taxation of the nation for what they considered a gross piece
of jobbing, tried to reduce the argument to the absurd, and
indignantly declared that Parliament had better at once enact
by law that the Newcastle colliers, instead of bringing their
coal direct to London, should sail "north about" to their market,
and make a preliminary tour around the United Kingdom.
The answer to the attempted sarcasm was quick and decisive.
The ship-owners retorted, without hesitation, that, although it
must indeed be admitted that the Newcastle colliers were
allowed by law to choose the shortest and easiest route to
London, still it was not to be supposed that even here the
shipping interests had been overlooked. The laws practically
forbade the use of the inland and cheapest transit from the
nearer mines, with the single object of encouraging and developing
the coastwise shipping in the interest of the national
marine.

A protective system so logically perfect, so rigid in its obedience
to a single purpose, so universal in its scope, so minute
in its application, contains elements almost of grandeur. The
ruling class of England appeared in it as the masters of the
world. Around them and in harmony with them stood the
English nation. The colonies existed for their benefit. Allied
nations were made use of for their purposes, and the rest of
mankind were their enemies. It is literally true, that, if the
British Parliament had at this time possessed the power to
protect the interests of the people of the United Kingdom
and its colonial dependencies by causing every other existing
nation to be annihilated from the surface of the earth, an enactment
to that effect would have been only the logical sequence
of its whole system of legislation.

It is of course impossible even to conjecture what was the
actual cost to the citizen of this indirect taxation. But there
is one means of showing how grievously it pressed upon the
public, and how intolerable it would have been if the power
of the government could have enforced it.

There is a strange law of finance, which has fixed a limit to
indirect taxation, and decreed that, where the line is passed, a
new agent shall intervene for the protection of a misgoverned
people and the vindication of the laws of statesmanship. At
a certain point, the smuggler appears and rescues the nation
from its burdens. The extent to which smuggling is carried
is, therefore, the measure of bad revenue systems.

In England in 1816 there was no limit to the activity of the
smugglers. From Kent to Dorset and Devonshire, the whole
line of the coast swarmed with them, and wherever they came
the sympathies of the people were with them. Coast guards
were multiplied in every direction. The army itself was employed
in the service of the custom-house. The severity of
the penalties was terrible; yet any gentleman in London could,
at ten days' or a fortnight's notice, obtain any prohibited article
from the Continent, at thirty % advance upon its
cost there. Foreign silks were prohibited; but, in spite of the
prohibition, they were to be seen in every haberdasher's shop
in England, and in the very Houses of Parliament. Mr. Hume,
the well-known member for Aberdeen, when arguing once
against the absurdity of those protective laws, "produced his
bandana handkerchief before the very eyes of the House, and,
having triumphantly unfurled the standard of smuggling, blew
his nose in it, and deliberately returned it to his pocket."
The only vindication of the offended majesty of the law attempted
by the Chancellor of the Exchequer consisted in
reminding Mr. Hume that any member of the House had an
absolute right to seize that bandana handkerchief and export
it to a foreign country. Upon every information laid under
this prohibitive law," said Mr. Huskisson in 1826, "the chances
are, that the informer and the constable have bandanas round
their necks, and that the magistrate who hears the charge has
one in his pocket." Another prohibited article was Scotch
whiskey, and Mr. Hume took again the occasion to inform the
House that he had at that moment smuggled Scotch whiskey
in his cellar, and he defied the whole power of the government
to prevent his having it.

These were, however, only luxuries. The case was much
worse when it concerned the great articles of consumption
among the people. Salt paid its duty of two-and-twenty times
its value on fifty thousand tons annually; but it was supposed
that twice as much more was consumed which paid no
duty at all, or only the moderate one which made the profit
of the smuggler or the thief. Soap was smuggled to nearly
as great an extent as salt. By this universal evasion, fraud,
and violence, the whole national character was perverted and
degraded.

But even the spectacle in England was a harmless comedy
in comparison with the results of this same system in Ireland.
If armies of four or five hundred smugglers, supported by the
population, fought pitched battles with the coast guard and
revenue officers on the chalk downs of Sussex and Hampshire,
and were not always defeated, there reigned all over Ireland,
from Dublin to Kinsale, a state of actual civil war, which was
waged by the peasantry, with horrible cruelty, by assassinations
and savage deeds of violence that are still remembered
with vivid force in that unhappy country, and which were met
and repressed, so far as force could repress them, by equally
exasperating acts of legalized cruelty and military violence.
Here it was the excessive duty on spirit that was intolerable to
the population; and yet this duty was but five shillings and
sixpence on the gallon, while more than twice the charge was
borne in England without serious difficulty. Financially, the
result was, that about three million gallons paid the tax, and
about seven millions were distilled and consumed in defiance
of the law. Politically, the attempt to enforce the tax resulted
in making Ireland more than ever a danger and disgrace
to Great Britain.

Such were some of the results of over-taxation and of an
overstrained protective system. It is obvious that the very
highest and most statesmanlike qualities were required in the
government that was to attempt the task of reform. But it is
not to be supposed that this was the only field for the activity
of reformers in the financial affairs of the country. The operation
of the taxes on the welfare of the people is only one
side of financial science. The administrative system under
which the revenue is collected and expended, if not first in
actual importance, is certainly first in order of time among
financial problems; for it is useless to expect economy and
foresight from a wasteful and blundering treasury, whose errors
are not the mere mistakes of an incompetent chief, but are the
inevitable result of false principles.

It is absolutely impossible to furnish anything like a fair
picture of the system under which the finances of Great Britain
suffered at the beginning of this century. The student, who
has labored month after month to comprehend it, turns away
at last with despair, and abandons the attempt as not worth,
even if successful, a tenth part of the mental effort that is
required to fathom it. There was no beginning, no middle,
and no end. There was a bottomless ocean of accounts, without
a system, without connection, and without result. There
were innumerable departments and bureaus, independent of
each other, and accountable to no one. The mysteries of the
exchequer were portentous. Few Englishmen, even then, had
any conception what functions were exercised by such mediæval
creations as the Department of the Pells, the Pipe
Office, and the Tally Court, the calm abodes of happy sinecurists,
whose duties of inconceivable clumsiness had long
been assumed by the Bank of England and other offices, but
who were still permitted to perform by deputy an imaginary
routine. If any one should still be unwisely curious to penetrate
these forgotten absurdities, he must consult the reports
of Parliamentary commissions from 1824 to 1834, which resulted
in their abolition. England, Scotland, and Ireland had
each its own exchequer, repeating these costly eccentricities
inherited from the Middle Ages.

Leaving this part of the investigation as of merely secondary
importance, the main inquiry must be directed to the method
of administering the treasury. This was an inheritance from
Mr. Pitt. When he had remodelled, in 1787, the whole system
of English finance, his great object was, not only to restore
order and method where only confusion had existed, but to
secure the ultimate redemption of the public debt. His idea
seems to have been, that, if a sufficient portion of the permanent
revenue were to be set aside and appropriated by law to
the payment of the annual interest and a certain part of the
principal of the debt, the result would be, not only to simplify
the accounts, but to furnish an additional guaranty for the
national credit. He therefore divided the whole of the revenues
of the country into two branches, applicable to two
distinct classes of payments. The first comprised all the
permanent taxes, united into one consolidated fund, and this
was by law appropriated to the payment of the permanent
charges of the national debt and the civil list. The second
comprised the taxes voted by Parliament only for the year,
and was left for the charges of the army and navy, and the
civil expenditure of the government.

Mr. Pitt's famous sinking fund was the supplement to this
plan. His original scheme was, that one million sterling should
be applied annually from surplus revenue, and should accumulate
at compound interest until the whole debt should be extinguished.

These large and ingenious arrangements answered all Mr.
Pitt's wishes for the first five years. His success was such as
to place him unquestionably at the head of all living statesmen.
But then the French war broke out, and no possible
financial scheme, except the simplest, could have resisted the
pressure of the next twenty-three years. In a surprisingly
short time all Mr. Pitt's elaborate structure crumbled to
pieces. Yet not only he, but all his successors, clung to the
hollow shells of the two funds with an obstinacy as remarkable
as their conduct of the war itself. For every new loan
that was raised, Parliament carefully set aside some few tax
to meet the annual charge, and appropriated it to the consolidated
fund, as though that fund still had some inherent virtue
which would insure the payment of the national obligations
in case all the rest of the system should become bankrupt, or
as though every tax, of whatever description, was not just as
much pledged to the payment of the interest of the debt as
though fifty acts of Parliament had reasserted the fact. This,
however, was only a cumbrous form of management. Th
sinking fund had became a most pernicious burden on the
nation. Every loan that was contracted, however ruinous the
terms, was increased by the amount of a certain proportion
of the whole, which was set aside as a part of the sinking
fund. In other words, it was expected to pay off the debt by
borrowing money at a time when the nation's credit was at its
lowest ebb. Under this treatment, the sinking fund rapidly
grew to gigantic proportions. It was perfectly evident that
the debt also increased in a similar or a greater ratio; but
nevertheless the government actually introduced a measure,
which became law, restricting the operation of the fund,
on the ground that it would pay off the debt too rapidly.
Nothing could shake the infatuated faith of the British people
in the magical efficacy of these two funds. The argument
against them was simply met by the assurance that, whether
right or wrong, the confidence of the public and the respect
of foreign nations were so largely founded on a belief in the
efficacy of the system, that the national creait would not stand
the shock of abandoning it.

However effective this answer may have been during the
dark years of the war, when the salvation of England depended
on her credit, it seems as though the return of peace should
have deprived it of further force. Yet the two funds continued
to flourish with unabated energy. The original scheme
of Mr. Pitt had long been lost, and little of his project remained
except the names and the mistakes. The system had
ceased to be comprehensible. The public accounts were a
chaos, and the budget speeches seem really to have been made
with the intention of adding to the confusion.

Parliament never knew, nor could know, what was the exact
relation between the income and expenditure of the year; and
when unreasonable radicals supplicated for a balance-sheet,
they were answered as though such an innovation were big
with revolutionary dangers. The fact of the total want of
a balance-sheet seems to modern minds so incredible, that it
may be well to quote a passage from the report of a select
committee on the public accounts, made to Parliament in 1822,
six years after the time now spoken of.

>The principal and most prominent defect in the present form of
the accounts is, that they neither do, nor can, exhibit any balance
between the income and expenditure of the year. The income side
of the account shows the amount collected from the subject and the
amount paid into the exchequer within the year. ... The expenditure-sheet
has not been framed on this principle; and, with respect
to some of the chief heads of the service, such as the army and the
ordnance, instead of containing a statement of the issues made from
the exchequer, it gives the amount of payments by the distributing
public officers, to whom the moneys required for their respective services
are issued from the exchequer. The account of incomes and
the account of expenditure, therefore, are accounts of different kinds,
and no true balance can be struck by comparing them together.

No man, whatever industry he might possess, could come to
an undisputed conclusion upon the financial situation of the
country. Mr. Hume asserted, in 1821, and no less an authority
than Mr. Ricardo indorsed the statement, that not only was
there a difference of some millions between the budget and the
annual accounts, in regard to the reduction of debt, but even
on so simple a matter as the deficiency of the consolidated
fund there were three public accounts, all signed by the same
person, all relating to the same period, and all presenting a
different result.

If Mr. Hume, whose Scotch sagacity and indefatigable patience
have never been equalled, and Mr. Ricardo, who was the
first political economist of his time, abandoned in despair the
attempt to unravel the complications of the consolidated fund,
which was then the principal part of the financial system,
the chance is small indeed that any man in the present day
can arrive at a better result. The budget speeches were
almost silent in regard to it, and the information given by the
official accounts was apparently only such as the humorous
disposition of the public accountant incited him to furnish by
way of a riddle for the amusement of over-zealous members
of the House of Commons. If the difficulty even were explained,
it is doubtful whether most people could understand
the explanation. The nature of the fund has already been
described. Certain taxes were appropriated to certain purposes.
So long as the taxes were sufficiently productive for
those payments, the system worked tolerably well. But there
were sometimes years when the taxes fell off, and their amount
was not sufficient to meet the charges put by law upon the
fund. When this happened, the government borrowed the
amount of the deficiency from the Bank, pledging exchequer
bills in return, and pledging the next quarter's receipts of the
fund to meet and pay these exchequer bills. The deficiency
meanwhile might or might not be reckoned as a part of the
annual deficiency, or a deduction from the annual surplus.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer enjoyed a wide latitude of
conscience on that point, and it was sometimes very convenient
to be able to shut his eyes to a deficit of seven or
eight million pounds, with which of course neither he nor the
House nor the country had anything to do, since it concerned
only the consolidated fund. The consolidated fund existed for
the very purpose of providing for the national debt, without
allowing the matter to enter into the range of common questions
of supply. There was, therefore, much to be said in
favor of the official view of the question.

But the transaction did not always end even here. The
fund borrowed, as a sort of independent corporation, the
amount of its arrears from the Bank. Let us suppose ten
millions to have been borrowed in this way. The Bank received
the taxes composing the resources of the fund as fast as
they were collected. Let us suppose a quarter's income, or
say eight million pounds, to have been nearly received, constituting
the guaranty for the debt owed by the fund. The government
now stepped in and borrowed this eight million for
its immediate wants, thus exhibiting the strange anomaly of
first creating a fund for no other purpose than to secure the
payment of debt, then allowing that fund to create a debt of
its own, and, finally, itself borrowing, as an advantage to the
public, its own money, which was already doubly pledged, and
substituting its own bonds as the security for the security of
the security for the national securities.

Is it to be wondered at that the cleverest men in England
were mystified when these transactions were put before them
piecemeal in separate accounts, and they were asked to guess
the riddle? It was notorious, that the Chancellor of the Exchequer
himself, whose experience at least was ample, did not
understand the very explanations which he himself made to
the House, far less the accounts that came to him from his own
department. The officers of the Exchequer openly confessed
that they could not comprehend the accounts which they made
out, and to which their names were signed. The public knew
nothing but its taxes.

There was another evil incident to this confused condition
of the finances. The functions of the Exchequer were assumed
by the Bank of England; and in the absence of a
powerful mind at the head of the government, the Bank had
become almost the exclusive director of the financial policy
of the country. The management of the Bank was not so
remarkable for ability at this time as to make such an arrangement
a great advantage. Mr. Ricardo went so far as to
say that it was totally ignorant of the principles of political
economy. When the House of Commons decided, in 1819,
to return to specie payments, the Bank presented a remonstrance
which contained a remarkable paragraph, appealing to
its duties to the community at large, "whose interests in a
pecuniary and commercial relation had, in a great degree, been
intrusted to its discretion." This assumption of authority, on
the part of a mere subordinate office, was treated by Mr. Peel
as a melancholy truth, the fault of Parliament itself, and of
the government which had thus allowed its functions to fall
into the hands of a private corporation.

If an energetic reform was required in the system of taxation
and in the administration of the public property, it was
certainly not less necessary to subject the expenditure to the
most rigid scrutiny. A thoroughly economical government is
among the rarest blessings ever vouchsafed to a nation, and a
long period of war does not tend to teach or to encourage the
habit of frugality. Besides, the English system of goverment
and of society was essentially an extravagant one, and only the
most resolute popular opposition could make the ruling party
conscious of this fact.

There were two great branches in the national expenditure,
which were about equal in amount. There was, in the first
place, the regular annual interest on the national debt, funded
and floating, which amounted to more than £30,000,000 sterling;
and this was, for the time, beyond the reach of economy.
But even here there was much to be done. It was necessary
to fund a large amount of the exchequer bills. It was necessary
to look sharply to the management of the debt by the
Bank. Above all, it was the part of a good finance minister
so to adapt his measures as to encourage popular confidence in
the national credit, in order to hasten the moment when a
reduction of interest should be possible on the most burdensome
of the public securities. This in itself involved a whole
system of finance, and demanded ability of the highest order.

The second branch of the expenditure was divided into several
heads. There were the civil expenses of government, the
army, the navy, the ordnance, and a miscellaneous division
which embraced a variety of appropriations as well for internal
improvements as for other purposes.

The most immediate want was, of course, a large measure
of reduction in the armaments, to be followed by an elaborate
reform in the various departments. During some years of the
war, the expenditure on this account had risen to more than
seventy millions, exclusive of foreign subsidies. The question
of what should be the proper peace establishment was one of
especial difficulty to a generation which had scarcely known
any condition but that of war; and it was made still more
embarrassing by the disturbed state of Ireland, requiring it to
be treated like a conquered country, as well as by the immense
colonial possessions of Great Britain, which seemed to demand
protection on account of their exposed positions and the mixture
of races.

The civil expenditure of the government had also been
allowed to flourish in unchecked extravagance during the war.
There was a rich field for reformers and radicals in the extirpation
of those numerous sinecure offices whose quaint names
and obsolete functions were little known to the public, except
so far as the regular annual parliamentary accounts established
the fact that there were still men who drew the salaries attached
to them. The whole amount of the civil expenditure
did not, indeed, form a very large proportion of the public
burdens. Two or three million pounds covered the whole
charge. But, large or small, it was too heavy for the taxpayers,
who were justly indignant if a single shilling were unnecessarily
added to the enormous sum which they were obliged
to pay. There was the more excuse for the most rigid economy,
since the privilege of possessing a constitutional monarch
and an aristocratic court was by no means obtained for nothing.
His Majesty's household cost the nation more than a
million sterling annually, with no visible return, since the
King was blind and insane, and lived in close confinement at
Windsor. How much the Prince Regent cost, Heaven only
knows. He drew £65,000 a year by way of pension on the
consolidated fund; but as he was perpetually in debt, and as
the country was perpetually called upon to pay his debts, it is
not easy to discover where the expense ended. Besides the
King and the Prince Regent, there were fifteen royal princes
and princesses who drew pensions, varying from £35,000
downwards, from the consolidated fund alone, making an aggregate
of rather more than £250,000 annually, on account
of the royal family; in return for which the nation not only
failed to obtain a magnificent court, but was obliged to satisfy
itself with one which was particularly offensive to its tastes.

It was, however, the British theory to pay public servants
well, except where they were not paid at all. Perhaps nothing
would have stung the average British mind more sharply,
than the idea that the representatives of his country abroad
were unable to maintain as high a scale of expense as those of
France, Russia, and Austria. The example of Prussia and
the United States of America was of no effect, except to place
those countries low in the British estimation. It was certain,
however, that the gratification of this fancy added largely to
the national expenditure; not so much, perhaps, from the actual
salaries paid, as by the scale of expense which was encouraged,
and the habit of lavishing large sums for small objects.
The most burdensome form in which this practice
showed itself was in the shape of pensions, superannuation
allowances, and similar charges, either for life or in perpetuity;
which, considering the fact that the salaries themselves were
in most cases so liberal, seem to have been somewhat superfluous,
and by no means calculated to impress any lesson of
economy upon the servants of the crown. The precise amount
of all the different classes of pensions after the war cannot
easily be ascertained, if, indeed, it is at all possible to collect
them from the published accounts of so many various departments
throughout the three kingdoms; but they formed one
of the most serious items of expense with which the government
had to deal, and those connected with the army and
navy gave occasion, in 1822, for an effort on the part of Mr.
Vansittart to diminish their burden, which was the last of
many financial operations effected by him, and which made his
name long notorious.

We have now passed in review, rapidly, and no doubt superficially,
but at as much length as is possible, the financial
difficulties with which England at the close of the war had to
struggle, so far as they related to the revenue. It would have
been fortunate for her if these had been the only evils bequeathed
to her by the war. Serious as they were, although
they demanded the most laborious attention, the exercise of
the highest order of intellect, and the most resolute per severance,
there remained still another evil, which lay behind
them all, and demanded an immediate remedy.

Considering the length and the violence of the strain to
which the resources of England had been subjected, it is rather
a matter of surprise that her currency had not become utterly
worthless, than that it should have suffered a certain degree of
depreciation. The Bank had suspended specie payments in
1797; but for more than ten years after that time the Bank
paper remained on a par with gold, or at a very slight discount.
It was only in 1809 that the price of bullion began to
maintain itself at a permanently higher rate, which continued
till the close of the war. In 1810, the average depreciation
of the currency was 13%. In 1814, it was 25%, and this was its lowest point. In 1815 and 1816, the
Bank paper gained credit, and averaged 16.7% discount.
Towards the close of the year 1816 the currency rose
without the necessity of legislation, until it stood on a par with
gold. Unfortunately, however, the mere fact that the Bank
notes were of the same value as gold was by no means equivalent
to a return to specie payments. The country had gone
through a period of depreciation, and, if this were allowed to
continue, was certain to be demoralized by it. Already the
agricultural interest complained because the farms, leased at a
time when corn sold at six pounds the quarter, could no longer
be made to pay the extravagant rental thus fastened upon
them. The business classes, the merchants, the bankers, the
retailers, naturally timid in the face of measures likely to
affect their interests, trembled with fear at the thought of
commencing business upon a system entirely new to all but the
oldest among them. Every month that the return to a specie
basis was delayed strengthened the ultimate opposition to the
measure, and encouraged the party which maintained that
promptness was dangerous, and that it was necessary by act
of Parliament to prevent the nation's too easy progress up an
ascent so difficult that few nations have ever succeeded in
climbing it.

The history of the process by which Great Britain succeeded
at length in restoring its original standard of value is one so
important, so instructive, but also so complicated and disputed,
that it cannot be dealt with in a few sentences. It requires
an entire chapter to itself. It called into full play the best
ability in England, and for many years after the result was
accomplished a perpetual dispute was maintained in regard to
its justice and its effects. Among the many financial difficulties
which surrounded the government of that day, this was the
one which a high statesmanship would have considered the
most pressing, for it lay at the basis of all transactions involving
an exchange of values, as well between the government
and its subjects as between every individual and his neighbor.

With this last difficult problem of the currency our survey
of the financial situation of Great Britain may be considered
completed. Yet something remains to be said in regard to the
men upon whom the vast labor fell of restoring order in the
national affairs, and of creating the new formulas by which
the economy of the nation was destined in the future to be
represented. For it is obvious that between such a condition
as has been described and that which England enjoys at present
there is not a difference of degree, but of kind. It is a
complete revolution that has taken place, and not merely a
modification. Only fifty years have passed, and there has been
no break of continuity; a steady and natural process of development
has been always going on, always irresistibly tending
towards one result, until at length we find that the principles
upon which the government of England acts are the direct
reverse of those which it considered essential in 1816. Mr.
Huskisson, Mr. Peel, and Mr. Frederick Robinson were all in
the government at the close of the war, and supported Mr.
Vansittart's measures so far as they were called upon to do so ;
yet these were the very men by whom the subsequent policy
was created and developed. There appears to be something
that needs explanation in this curious copartnership.

Lord Liverpool's followers comprised a considerable majority
of the House of Commons, and usually followed their leader
without useless remonstrance, wherever their orders directed.
But nevertheless the government itself contained two classes
of members so strangely differing in character that their successful
co-operation may well be a matter of surprise.

Lord Liverpool's own opinions were naturally sound and
liberal upon economical questions, though he wanted the force
of personal character to stamp them upon his administration.
Nor indeed was there even in men like Lord Castlereagh, Mr.
Vansittart, and Mr. Rose any such devotion to antiquated
prejudices as might be supposed from the condition of the departments
they directed. Mr. Vansittart was not a man gifted
with the blind Toryism of Lord Sidmouth, or the narrowminded
perverseness of Lord Eldon. He was simply a thoroughly
incompetent man. It would scarcely be worth the
while to dwell upon his qualities at any length, if it were not
that he was almost a perfect representative of the old school
of financiers, --- the school of Perceval and Addington,--- a
school which had sprung from Mr. Pitt's side when his better
days had passed, and which lent the influence of narrow minds
to encourage and aggravate the mistakes of a great one. English
finance has not even yet entirely cleared itself from the
traditions of this period.

Mr. Vansittart had served long in the treasury, and had
stored his mind with all the intricate knowledge of financial
machinery that a laborious subordinate can always so readily
learn. Mr. Pitt, no doubt, was an object of his unbounded
admiration. But the qualities which he would admire in Mr.
Pitt would probably be precisely those which caused him,
with all his genius, to create nothing which has endured.
Men like Mr. Vansittart and his contemporaries in office
thought it little that Mr. Pitt had aimed at magnificent results,
that his ambition led him into a superb attempt to pay
off the national debt, and that to effect his purpose he had
created, with scarcely any assistance from precedent, a great
and admirable system where none existed before. What dazzled
the eyes of Mr. Pitt's successors was, that the machinery
invented by him was rich in detail and ingenious in expedients.
That every loan should have its special tax, that
every tax should go to a special fund, that each fund should
be so constructed as to balance and support the other, --- that
there should be wheels within wheels, and springs beneath
springs, until the whole structure was elaborated to a point
of theoretical perfection,--- this it was that seemed wonderful
to the men that had seen its creation and had received it from
the hands of its dying inventor. The results of such an education
were most disastrous to England, for there arose a race of
so-called financiers; --- men who drew their political economy
from the traditions of the Exchequer, and their financial knowledge
from the Stock Exchange; men whose highest idea
of a policy was the skill to place a loan at a half %
better terms than its predecessor had obtained; men who to
effect this tried to mystify the public, and to avail themselves
of all the complications in which the official accounts were so
rich; men who in the struggle to obtain means for carrying
limits of taxation, to go beyond which was a folly and a crime;
and finally, men who, in their zeal to raise money, entirely
disregarded the fact, that the first duty of a finance minister
is to exercise some degree of economy in spending it.

As a Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Vansittart's incapacity
was scarcely a matter of dispute. But he possessed,
from long experience, the kind of tact and business knowledge
which gives men influence in the House of Commons, and frequently
enabled him to meet with success the attacks of the
Whig opposition. There was in his character a fund of good
nature and a cordial indifference to abuse which attracted
sympathy, and protected him when opposition members howled
in his face, that "the present distresses were occasioned by
having a miserable, miscalculating, puny Chancellor of the
Exchequer, who did not know the resources of the country,
owing to the ignorance and want of power of his little mind."
Although a heavy burden to the Ministry of which he was a
member, he long retained his office, and only retired to the
honorable ease of the House of Lords in 1822, after having
been ten years at the head of the finances.

Of the liberal wing of the administration Mr. Huskisson
was by far the ablest member, and indeed it is not too much
to say that, within his own sphere of economical subjects, he
was not surpassed by any man then in public life. The extent
of his knowledge, the soundness of his judgment, the
breadth of his views, and his natural instinct, leading him
always to stand just so far in advance of his contemporaries
as to inspire them with confidence in the safety and moderation
of his guidance without obliging them to accept paradoxical
or unpopular truths, --- these qualities combined to
give Mr. Huskisson a personal weight which only needed the
support of high office to prove itself in great administrative
reforms. But, unfortunately, he was no politician, and in
consequence had so managed his party course as to throw
away the power he had a right to claim, until at forty-six
years old he still found himself buried out of sight as Chief
Commissioner of Woods and Forests, when he might and
should have been in a commanding position in the Cabinet.

The political blunders of Mr. Huskisson had thrown a
younger and much weaker man into the foreground. Mr.
Frederick Robinson, the Vice-President of the Board of Trade,
rapidly rose to be President of that Board, Chancellor of the
Exchequer, Secretary for the Colonies, and Prime Minister.
Mr. Frederick Robinson, Lord Goderich, or Earl of Ripon, by
whichever name we may choose to call him, was a man of
considerable abilities and a decidedly liberal turn of mind;
but as a statesman he was particularly happy in having two
great men at his side, Mr. Canning and Mr. Huskisson. With
their assistance he accomplished great results, without it he
found the burden of a high position intolerable. At the return
of peace he was still in a subordinate office, but even
there his influence was thrown, not without effect, on the side
of progress and reform.

It cannot be said that this was the case with Mr. Peel, who
was the Chief Secretary for Ireland at this time. Mr. Peel's
power consisted, not so much in the opinions which he held
and advocated, as in his capacity for changing them at the
right moment. Few statesmen of his rank have changed their
political creed so much and on so many points; perhaps not
one has ever, like him, succeeded through all changes in re:taining
popular confidence and esteem. At the close of the
war he was an extreme Tory; and although he was ultimately
influenced greatly by his association with Mr. Huskisson, it
was a very long time before he became a convert to those
opinions on questions of trade which have made his reputation
eclipse that of his teacher. It is one of the most curious
facts of modern English history, that he who in 1817 was the
ally of Lord Sidmouth and Lord Eldon should have become
the disciple of Cobden and the model of Gladstone.

The ablest of all the statesmen of this period was certainly
Mr. Canning. But, unfortunately both for himself and for the
country, Mr. Canning had allowed the wave of political success
to sweep over him, and to carry Lord Castlereagh on its crest.
It was not until Lord Castlereagh's death, in 1822, that Mr.
Canning's influence obtained the control of the administration,
and began to set in action the progressive energies of the
nation.

All these men belonged to the Tory party. The old Whig
opposition had little to offer that was better, if so good, and
what little it had was soon lost. The ablest of the Whigs in
the field of financial science was Mr. Francis Horner, who, as
chairman of the famous Bullion Committee, had treated very
roughly the strange absurdities of Mr. Vansittart. The report
of that committee, of which he was for the most part the author,
was made in 1810, and in spite of the triumphant vote
by which, in 1811, Mr. Vansittart carried his resolution, that
"the promissory notes of the Bank of England have hitherto
been, and are at this time held to be equivalent to the legal
coin of the realm," Mr. Horner's argument practically settled
the question, and made his opponent's name an object of standing
ridicule down to this day, --- a result the more annoying,
since Mr. Vansittart was not himself the real author of the resolution.
It is safe to say that, if Mr. Horner had lived, his
influence on the financial and commercial policy of England
would have been very considerable; but his death, which took
place in 1817, broke short a most promising career, and, combined
with that of Sir Samuel Romilly, deprived the Whig
opposition of all its best vital force.

For it cannot be said that Mr. Henry Brougham's brilliant
qualities at all supplied the place of Mr. Horner's sound intellect.
Mr. Brougham busied himself with economical questions,
as he did with every other topic; but before and above all, he
was a politician, and a selfish one. A man of far greater
worth, from every point of view, was Mr. Ricardo, whose position
as a member of Parliament often enabled him to infuse
into the debates a spirit of philosophy which is rare enough
in the best of legislative assemblies. He, however, did not
enter Parliament till 1819; and his death, in 1823, took place
before the new theories of internal policy were fairly developed.
Another person, who came into public life at the same time,
but whose career lasted through all the vicissitudes of free
trade down to a very late day, was an eminently useful and
energetic reformer, whom the English public laughed at and
abused during his whole life, but discovered after his death
to have been one of those rare, bold, indefatigable, and scrupulously
honest characters, whose existence makes amends for a
world of Parliamentary nobodies. This was Joseph Hume,---
a thorn in the side of each successive ministry, a sort of selfconstituted
tribune of the people, with an eye for abuses and a
tongue for dilating upon them that made him at once the terror
of ministers and of the House, which fled from his speeches
with some reasonable excuse. Mr. Hume was, however, a man
of broad and statesmanlike views, which is more than can
fairly be said of Mr. Cobbett, though the latter was even more
active in his denunciation of the evils that were so strongly
stamped upon the system of internal government. In fact,
the popular feeling was too strongly directed upon political
grievances to allow of its giving any deep attention to difficult
financial and commercial questions, the connection of which
with its own objects was not always obvious; and popular
orators, like Cobbett and Hunt, exercised only an indirect and
very modified influence upon the development of those liberal
and progressive economical theories which neither Whig nor
Tory could claim as exclusively their own property, but which
each party made use of in its turn.

Thus it will be seen how small was the number of prominent
men who, in 1816, could exercise an influence in favor of
reform. And in this respect it is only right to do justice to
Lord Liverpool and Mr. Vansittart. Neither they nor their
opponents considered finance as a field for party divisions.
Mr. Vansittart's want was one of capacity, not of will. It is
a curious fact that he, though administering a system in which
protection was carried to absurdity, was yet in his opinions a
free-trader, as was also Lord Liverpool. Both of them were
far in advance on this point of the public opinion of their
time; for the popular wishes so far as concerned finance were
solely directed to the reduction of taxation, and the knowledge
of financial theories was extremely slight even among the
wealthiest of the middle class. This was shown in regard to
the income tax. Fifty years later the income tax was a popular
measure, since it threw upon the holders of property an
immediate burden which otherwise must have been borne by
the poor. In 1816 the property tax was thoroughly unpopular,
not only among the rich, but among the poor whom itrelieved,
and who actually allowed themselves to be persuaded
that the heavy duties on corn, tea, beer, and tobacco were
preferable to one which they did not feel! It was necessary,
therefore, that the small body of political economists who saw
in advance that free trade, whether suitable or not for other
nations, was the only possible policy for England, should begin
at the very foundation, and educate even those for whose
special benefit their measures would immediately operate.
There was no basis of existing public opinion upon which they
could stand.

If, then, we attempt to sum up the results of this long
inquiry into a condition of affairs now forgotten, we shall
find that Great Britain, then a nation of twenty million inhabitants,
was burdened with an annual charge of more
than £30,000,000 of debt, to which was added more than
£20,000,000 of ordinary expenditure; that her administrative
system was in the highest degree cumbrous, expensive,
and inefficient; that her revenue was drawn indiscriminately
from every available source, without regard to the disastrous
results upon national industries and the national character,
and in violation of all the acknowledged principles of political
economy; that her expenditure was extravagant, and without
any sufficient check in public opinion; that her currency was
deranged, and the standard of value fluctuating in such a
manner as to stimulate powerful interests towards resistance
to any return to the former specie basis; that her principal
officers were unequal to the effort which a return to sound
financial and economical principles would have required; that
Parliament, with the exception of a very few of its members,
was incompetent to deal properly with such a state of affairs,
and too apt to be influenced by personal and political motives;
and, finally, that the people were themselves ignorant of the
true nature of the difficulties under which they were laboring,
and the few really progressive minds in England were
obliged to trust to those natural popular instincts which in
the end usually decide rightly in regard to the interests of
the people.

It was not surprising that some of the most patriotic and
excellent Englishmen were in alarm lest their country should
succumb under this accumulation of difficulties. And yet a
few years of peaceful development enabled it to support the
burden of the debt with an ease which is a just subject for
pride; it purged the administrative system of its abuses, and
made it comparatively simple, economical, and efficient; it
created a wholly new system of revenue, founded on sound
laws, and interfering to the least possible extent with the
industry and character of the people. If it has not restricted
the expenditure, and reduced the debt so far as was possible
and right, this is merely because the people themselves, in
their wealth, became indifferent and extravagant; it restored,
without any concession to interested clamor, the ancient and
only sound basis to the currency; it educated a race of statesmen
who, in regard to economical subjects, were certainly not
inferior to any in the world; it placed in Parliament numbers
of men who, whatever their faults may have been or may now
be, were, and are now, better acquainted with those laws of
financial science --- ignorance of which has become inexcusable
in legislators --- than the members of any other legislative
assembly in Europe; and, finally, it has diffused among the
people a degree of acquaintance with the true bearing of their
own interests, which has strangely modified their national tendencies,
and will ultimately wholly break down the ancient
barriers of insular prejudice and exclusiveness.

The process by which these results have been effected, and
the consideration of what has still been left incomplete, must
be a worthy subject of careful study; but it involves so great
a variety of topics, and so wide a range of doubtful or disputed
conclusions, that, unless rigidly restricted within the
proper limits of the regions that belong purely to finance, the
discussion would soon extend itself beyond any ordinary capacity
of endurance, and lose the interest which belongs to it
of furnishing instruction to other nations placed in circumstances
more or less similar.
