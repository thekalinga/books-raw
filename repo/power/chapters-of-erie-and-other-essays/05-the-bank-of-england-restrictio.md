# The Bank of England Restriction 1797--1821[^/225]

During the eighteenth century the mechanism of trade
had been elaborated in Great Britain to a high point of
perfection. London had become in a great degree the centre
of commerce for the whole world, while the Bank of England
was the business centre of London. But the Bank had a
double sphere of usefulness. As a private corporation, it exercised,
not less by the high character of its directors than by
the amount of its capital and the privileges of its charter, a
great influence over all foreign and domestic trade. By common
agreement, its notes circulated within London to the
exclusion of all other bank-paper. Its discounts represented
at that time a far greater proportion of the active capital of
England than they now do. But its operations were not
restricted within the limits of ordinary banking; it was also
a recognized official agent. As a national establishment, it
issued the coin, managed the debt, took charge of government
deposits, and made advances to the Exchequer and the Treasury,
on security of Exchequer Bills. In the same capacity, it
was expected to perform the difficult duty of maintaining a
supply of gold, not merely for circulation, but in anticipation
of any sudden drain or panic, which might cause a run upon
the other banking institutions of the country. It was obliged,
therefore, to purchase at a fixed rate all the gold which was
brought to its counters. Thus, as a bank of discount, it held
the exclusive privilege of discounting government paper; as a
bank of deposit, it alone held the public balances; as a bank
of issue, its circulation alone passed through the hands of the
government as well as of the public. Its notes, when not
issued in loans on Exchequer Bills to the government, or in
payment for the precious metals as already mentioned, could
only pass into circulation through the medium of discounts
furnished to merchants. Neither then, nor at any time, has
the Bank had other than these three means of issuing its
paper; and as it is clear that, so far as the second is concerned,
no notes could be sent out which did not represent
their equivalent in coin or bullion brought in, the only possible
mode of issuing an excess of paper must have been either
by loans to the government on security of Exchequer Bills, or
in regular and legitimate commercial discounts.

[^/225]: From the North American Review for October, 1867.

All foreign and most provincial payments were ultimately
settled by drafts on London. But the country merchants and
others, who had occasion in this manner to extend their connections
beyond the limits of a district, usually found it convenient
to deal through the local bankers of their neighborhood,
rather than to draw upon correspondents of their own.
In 1797, there were about three hundred and fifty such
country banks in England and Wales, most, if not all, of
which were banks of issue; and as they were always liable to
be called upon to redeem their notes either in gold, in Bank
of England notes, or in bills of exchange drawn on London, it
is evident that their circulation was subject to all the variations
of the London money-market.

Besides this practical check, yet another control was exercised
by the Bank of England over the credit operations of
the country. Every private banker naturally felt that his
own credit depended upon the solvency of his customers; and
he was obliged, by the very nature of his business, to acquire
the most accurate knowledge in his power of the people who
dealt with him. In precisely the same way the London
banker, his correspondent, looked carefully to the country
client's credit, and to the character of the bills which he dealt
in; while in his own city the Londer banker was subjected
to the scrutiny of the business community of London, whose
opinions, centring upon one point, guided the policy and the
particular discounts and accommodations of the Bank of England.
Thus again the Bank was at once the head and heart
of English credit; it exercised a controlling influence even
upon the remote provincial trader.

So far as the currency was concerned, the Bank could, by
contracting its issues, affect in a short time the whole circulation
of England; and naturally, when such a contraction had
taken place, a renewed expansion on its part would be likely
to result in a similar movement on the part of private bankers.
But the antiquated and mischievous legislation of Parliament
still maintained, and, in spite of the severest practical
lessons, long continued to maintain, a legal maximum of interest
at five %, even when the government itself was
borrowing at six. At present the Bank regulates its discounts
by raising or lowering its rate according to the value of money
in the open market. But while the usury laws were in force,
the Bank continued to lend its credit at five %, whether
the market value was at two or at twenty; and it possessed
no means of restricting its discounts and contracting its circulation
other than that of refusing a certain proportion of each
applicant's paper, without regard to his solvency or credit.
Such a measure was seldom resorted to, since it was calculated
to aggravate the evils of a financial pressure, by sacrificing the
public in order to save the Bank. In practice, therefore, it
will be seen that the Bank avoided the exercise of any other
control over its discounts and circulation than is implied by a
proper regard for the soundness of the bills it discounted.
The directors might exercise more or less of caution in their
loans, according as individual credit varied; but they never
during the Restriction attempted to act upon exchange or general
credit, either by contracting or by expanding their issues.

The average amount of Bank of England notes in circulation,
during ten years before the Restriction, was £10,800,000.
The best authorities estimate that the coin may have then
amounted to about £20,000,000, or somewhat more. There
was also a large quantity of country bank paper; while certain
wealthy districts, as Lancashire, for example, used no other
currency than bills of exchange, which were passed from hand
to hand, and in every case indorsed by the holder. There can
be no reasonable confidence placed, therefore, in any estimate
which assumes to establish any fixed sum as representing the
value of English currency, previous to the Restriction. Perhaps
£40,000,000 would be a moderate value to assign for
it; and from this calculation Scotland and Ireland are excluded,
since their currency systems were independent of
England, and exercised no more influence upon hers than those
of Holland or Hamburg.

The great war, which lasted, with only a few months' intermission,
for upwards of twenty years, began in February, 1793. It was preceded and accompanied by a violent commercial
crisis throughout Europe, which caused in England a
great number of bankruptcies, and a heavy fall in prices, the
country banks suffering especially; but the Bank of England
succeeded in maintaining its credit unimpaired under the
shock; and, in spite of every difficulty, continued its specie
payments and its ordinary discounts, to the immense relief of
the mercantile community. Two years of the war passed
away without altering this position of affairs. It was not till
1795 that a drain of bullion to the Continent began, which
obliged the Bank directors to resort to the extraordinary
measure of contracting their issues by rejecting a certain proportion
of the applications made upon them for discounts,
without regard to the credit of the applicants. During the
next two years the Bank circulation was steadily diminished,
as the supply of gold became smaller and smaller. But this
policy of contraction was seriously hampered by the necessities
of Mr. Pitt, then Prime Minister, who insisted upon advances,
which the directors could not honestly furnish. The Bank
records are filled with repeated remonstrances addressed to
Mr. Pitt on this account, and these, in February, 1796, were
carried to the extent of an absolute refusal to discharge the
bills drawn; while again, in July of the same year, a similar
refusal was only overcome by the positive assurance of Mr.
Pitt that it would be impossible to avoid the most serious and
distressing embarrassments to the public service, unless an
advance to the extent of £800,000 were made. The Bank
yielded, but only under the strongest protest, declaring that
nothing but the extreme pressure and exigency of the case
could in any shape justify the directors in acceding. Whether
this source of difficulty was due to bad management on the
part of Mr. Pitt, or whether he had no choice but to lean upon
the Bank, is of little consequence. The directors, at all events,
carried out their policy of contraction. While the drain of
gold continued, and their treasure fell from £6,000,000 in
1795 to £2,000,000 in August, 1796, the circulation was
simultaneously reduced from £14,000,000 to £9,000,000.
But violent as this contraction was, it failed to counteract the
causes of the drain. Foreign subsidies, the payment for large
quantities of imported grain, and of articles the price of which
had been enormously increased by the war demand, prevented
the exchange from rising. It is estimated that for three years,
from 1794 to 1796, these extraordinary payments amounted
to £40,000,000,--- a calculation which is certainly not extravagant,
if compared with the length of time and the amount
of pressure required to restore the exchanges.

It is difficult to say what more could have been done by the
Bank in order to preserve the country from the evils of an
inconvertible currency. The directors might have refused
to advance another shilling in loans, and, in order to save
themselves, might have forced a national bankruptcy, as well
as general private ruin; but they could scarcely have reduced
their issues more resolutely than they did, or resisted more
obstinately the entreaties of the merchants. These last were
mercilessly sacrificed; and their fate was especially hard,
since the crisis appears to have been caused by no act of
theirs, but solely by a combination of political and natural
agencies, by bad harvests and foreign wars, over which they
could have exercised no control, and on the occurrence or the
cessation of which they could not have calculated.

The measures thus taken by the Bank were in fact successful.
Early in 1797, the tide had already turned; the foreign
exchanges began to improve; and there can be no doubt that,
had the Bank been able to stand another month or two of
pressure, gold would have flowed plentifully into its coffers.
But precisely at the time of extreme exhaustion, after the foreign
drain had been checked, but when the Bank was too weak
for further resistance, a sudden panic seized the people of
England. An ungrounded alarm of French invasion caused a
run upon the banks of Newcastle, and obliged them to suspend
payment. From Newcastle, the panic spread in all
directions. Every country banker rushed to the Bank of
England for assistance or for gold. The Bank responded by
forcing its issues down to £8,640,000, while its treasures fell
to £1,200,000, and the panic naturally grew more and more
violent. Hopeless of averting their fate, the directors at last
sent word to Mr. Pitt that suspension was inevitable; and on
the morning of Monday, the 27th of February, an Order in
Council, issued the preceding day, was posted on the doors of
the Bank, forbidding further payments in cash.

The policy of the Bank throughout this crisis has been
since that day very generally criticised; and the directors
themselves afterwards expressed it as their opinion that the
contraction had been pressed too far, until it contributed to
bring about the very difficulty it was intended to preclude. It
is contended that a bolder policy should have been adopted,
and that the discounts should have been liberally increased,
while the gold should have been paid out down to the last
guinea. In support of this theory is instanced the celebrated
crisis of 1825, when the Bank, in face of a drain which reduced
its stock of gold to £1,027,000, increased its issues
from £17,000,000 to 25,000,000, and succeeded in restoring
confidence and maintaining its payments. However this may
be, it is at least a matter of regret that Mr. Pitt should have
sanctioned suspension before exhausting every possible alternative.
At the worst, the Bank could only have refused to
redeem its notes. While there was a single chance left of
escaping this final disaster, neither Mr. Pitt nor the Bank
directors were justified in neglecting it. The mere political
consequences of suspension, in that disastrous year, were a
triumph to the enemy as important as the mutiny at the Nore
or the Treaty of Leoben.

Mr. Pitt, however, felt the necessity of maintaining the
credit of the Bank; and he appears to have thought that this
might be done by giving to the suspension an official appearance,
and throwing upon it the character of a compulsory act
of government. He represented the Bank as a passive, or
even unwilling, instrument, in the hands of the Privy Council.
The expedient was shallow, and unworthy of so great a man;
nor was it likely to deceive any person, however dull of comprehension
he might be. But its result was fortunate; for
while Mr. Pitt declared that the affairs of the Bank were in
the most affluent and flourishing condition, and that the
restriction was only a precautionary government measure,
which in a few weeks would be removed, he established, unconsciously
as we must believe, a legal fiction of some value.
Parliament never recognized any incapacity on the part of the
Bank to meet its obligations, but only a temporary restriction,
created by itself, and limited by law to a certain period.
There was at least a delicate distinction favorable to national
pride and private credit involved in this idea that there was
no actual bankruptcy in the case, but that the government
had seen fit, for the public convenience, to relieve the Bank
for a time from a duty which it was still ready and able to
perform.

It was not unnatural, indeed, that Mr. Pitt should make use
of this or any other deception in order to quiet the general
alarm. The idea of inconvertible currency was, in 1797,
exclusively associated with the Continental paper of the
American Congress, and with the assignats of the French
Directory. It was supposed by men like Fox and Lord Lansdowne
that the mere fact of inconvertibility must soon destroy
that confidence in paper which enabled it to represent
values. A few months, it was believed, would bring about
this decay of credit. To provide against such a disaster,
extraordinary efforts were required. On the very day of suspension,
a great meeting was held at the Mansion House, the
Lord Mayor presiding; and more than three thousand business
men pledged themselves, by resolution, to receive and to make
their payments in bank-notes, as equivalent to coin. A nearly
similar paper was signed and published by the Lords of the
Council. At the present time, such a pledge would, in similar
circumstances, be considered as quite superfluous; but in that
day it had a value, and tended to restore public confidence.
Had the foreign drain still continued, bank-paper would, no
doubt, have rapidly fallen to a discount, in spite of all the
resolutions that could have been passed; but we have already
seen that this cause of difficulty had ceased to act. The only
effect of suspension was to lower the exchanges for a very few
days, after which they again rallied, and before the close of
the year they had risen to the highest point ever known. The
Bank at once increased its issues, and commerce returned to
its regular routine.

The suspension having once taken place, it became necessary
for Parliament to intervene, not merely to legalize the
act, but to establish a status for the new condition of the Bank.
A secret committee was appointed, which made elaborate investigations,
and concluded by reporting a bill, indemnifying
the governor and directors for all acts done in pursuance of the
Order in Council; superseding all actions which might have
been brought against them for refusing payments; prohibiting
them from issuing cash, except in sums under twenty shillings;
sheltering them from prosecutions for withholding payment
of notes, for which they were willing to offer other notes in
exchange; restricting them from advancing to the Treasury
any sum exceeding £600,000; obliging the collectors of revenue
to receive bank-notes in payment; protecting the subject
from arrest for debt, unless the affidavit to hold him to bail
contained a statement that the amount of debt claimed had
not been tendered in money or bank-notes; and limiting the
duration of the restriction to the 24th of June following.

It is interesting to observe how cautiously the government
acted. The policy of Mr. Pitt may not have been bold,
nor necessarily correct; but it was at least free from the grievous
mistakes which have ruined or dishonored almost every
country where an inconvertible currency has existed. He
began by treating the suspension as a temporary difficulty,
and carefully limiting its duration. In this respect, his successors
invariably followed his example; and never, during the
next twenty-three years, was there a time when Parliament
allowed the country to consider the restriction as other than a
temporary measure, for the termination of which a provision
was made by law. He further pledged the government not to
make an improper use of the Bank resources, nor to tamper
with the currency by obtaining excessive advances, and this
pledge he honestly observed. Finally, he refused to make the
bank-note a legal tender, except as between the government
and the public, still allowing the creditor to insist upon payment
in coin, if he chose to do so; and leaving open to him
his ordinary process in law, except only the power of arrest in
the first instance. England probably owes more than she is
aware of to Mr. Pitt for his forbearance in regard to the currency.
His necessities were great, and his power was unlimited.
He might have used paper money as was done by
contemporary financiers; but the example which he set became
a law for his successors, so that whatever mistakes he
or his imitators may have made, they are not chargeable with
that of tampering with the currency.

The Restriction Act passed without opposition, and in June
was continued till one month after the commencement of the
next session. In the mean time, gold began again to flow into
the Bank, which held in August treasure to the amount of
£4,000,000, against a circulation of £11,000,000. When
Parliament again met in the autumn, the Bank directors
announced themselves ready to resume payments, "if the
political circumstances of the country do not render it inexpedient."

Had Mr. Pitt been able to foresee the course which events
would take during the next ten years, he would surely have
acted at once upon this opportunity. The dangers and temptations
of irredeemable paper were too obvious for any statesman
to incur them, unless under an absolute necessity. But
Mr. Pitt probably foresaw something very different from what
actually occurred. He had every reason to expect a series of
monetary convulsions and commercial misfortunes, such as had
harassed him since 1792. On the other hand, he saw that
none of the prophesied evils had really followed restriction.
It had been proved that bank-paper did not depend for its
credit merely on its convertibility. Month after month had
passed away, not only without bringing depreciation, but even
rapidly increasing the stream of precious metals which flowed
towards England, so that people were little inclined to dwell
upon the dangers or temptations of restriction, and probably
overestimated its value as a safeguard against panic. They
were already demoralized. Mr. Pitt was not ashamed to fall
back upon the hint given by the Bank directors, and to declare
"that the avowal by the enemy of his intention to ruin
our public credit was the motive for an additional term of restriction";
--- thus, as Mr. Tierney rejoined, in order to leave
the enemy no credit to attack, destroying it himself; for it is
difficult to see how France was prevented by the Restriction
from any action upon public credit, except precisely that of
causing another restriction.

The bill, however, by which the measure was continued till
one month after the conclusion of peace, passed with little
opposition, Mr. Fox and his friends having ceased to take
part in the debates. Had the Bank been now obliged to resume
its cash payments, it would have had no great difficulty
in maintaining them till 1808 or 1809, when it must inevitably,
from mere political causes, have again broken down. But
the occasion was lost, and from this time the Restriction took
its place among the permanent war-measures of the government.

Previous to the suspension, no bank-note of less than five
pounds in value was allowed to circulate. Under the new state
of affairs this prohibition was removed, and notes of one and
two pounds began rapidly to drive gold from ordinary use.
With this exception, the public appears to have been quite unaffected
by the change in the currency. Throughout the year
1798 the Bank continued to receive treasure, and the foreign
exchanges continued favorable, until at the end of February,
1799, there was an accumulation of more than £7,500,000 in
the Bank vaults, against a circulation in notes of less than
£13,000,000. Apparently nothing could be more solid than
such a position. No expansion of consequence occurred in the
Bank circulation; and yet, by the close of 1799, the exchanges
had turned against England, and the gold began to disappear
as rapidly, or almost as rapidly, as it had accumulated. The
explanation of this sudden revolution was simple. A deficient
harvest had caused large importations of corn; a severe commercial
crisis at Hamburg had produced a considerable pressure
for the immediate transmission of funds from England;
and the war on the Continent created a perpetual demand for
gold to supply the armies. Had the Bank now been obliged
to redeem its notes, it might probably have contracted its
issues. Instead of doing so, it extended them in proportion
to the increased demand for discounts thrown upon it by the
rise in the market rate of interest, and the circulation rose till
in the first quarter of 1801 it averaged nearly £16,500,000.
The price of gold also rose, until it stood at a premium of ten
%.

These events naturally caused uneasiness; they gave rise,
in fact, to the first currency controversy. Mr. Boyd, a member
of Parliament, published a pamphlet with the object of
proving that the depreciation was due to the excess of banknotes.
He was answered by Sir Francis Baring and Mr.
Henry Thornton, whose work remains to this day a standard
authority. As the question then raised was practically identical
with that which ten years afterwards excited the most
elaborate and earnest discussion, we shall not now stop to examine
into it. Events soon decided in favor of Mr. Boyd's
opponents. The Bank continued its policy undisturbed; the
pressure ceased; during 1801 and 1802 the foreign exchanges
again rose, and gold fell almost to par. It seems to be beyond
dispute that the temporary depreciation of 1801 was preceded
by the fall of exchange, and was caused by it; and that, when
the accidental foreign demand for gold had been satisfied, the
currency returned to its natural value, without any effort on
the part of the Bank, or any artificial pressure on credit or on
the circulation.

Without admitting this to be the case, it appears scarcely
possible to explain the course which events afterwards took,
and the perfect stability of the currency during a number of
years when the circulation was still further enlarged. The
Treaty of Amiens was signed in March, 1802; and the interval
of peace, short as it was, allowed Great Britain a momentary
relief of inestimable value. But the Restriction Act was again
continued for another term, and the Bank circulation rose to
nearly £ 17,400,000, without producing any sensible effect on
exchange or on the price of gold. War was resumed in May,
1803, but without affecting the value of the currency, which
during the next five years remained stationary in its amount,
or only varied slightly between £16,000,000 and £17,000,000.
The Bank, meanwhile, anxious to maintain its reserve of bullion,
offered a standing premium of about three % for
gold, and hence it has been usually supposed that the banknotes
were actually depreciated to this extent. This, however,
was not the case. Under such circumstances the exchanges
become the only true standard, and in those days the quotations
of exchange included any existing depreciation of paper;
the nominal, not the real, exchange was always given, so that,
in the want of any fair quotations of gold, we can only estimate
its fluctuations in value by means of the recorded fluctuations
in exchange. It appears that these were very slight,
and rather in favor of England than against her, so that the
Bank had actually accumulated in 1805 the very unusual sum
of £ 7,600,000,--- a result which indicates that the bank-notes
with which this treasure was bought could not have been depreciated
to the full extent of the three-per-cent bonus offered
as an inducement to the seller. During the whole of this
period from 1803 to 1808, Bank paper was in fact at par, or
not enough below it to have made the exportation of gold
profitable in a time of specie payments. There were no doubt
intervals when the Bank lost gold, but, if the average of each
year be taken, it will be found that the exchanges were uniformly
favorable.

No comparison can be just which is drawn between such a
state of things as this and the ordinary forced issues of government
paper, such as have been known in most countries
suffering under prolonged difficulties. There is a distinct difference
between the two cases, and we are obliged to dwell
with emphasis upon this difference, because we believe that it
entirely removes the English currency from the same class with
ordinary instances of depreciation. Usually the issue of paper
has been assumed by governments themselves, and such issues
have been made directly in payment of expenses, without providing
on the same scale for a return of the paper put out, or
consulting in any way the wants of the people. Bank of England
paper was in no sense a government issue. It was not
even government paper, but merely that of a private banking
corporation, which was conducted on very strict banking principles,
and whose notes, so far as they were in excess of public
wants, were inevitably returned at once to the bank counters.
The government, therefore, was not to blame if paper was issued
in excess; but in such a case it must have been the Bank
directors who failed to observe proper rules in their extensions
of credit either to the government or to individuals.

It is necessary, therefore, to turn aside for a moment in order
to examine the Bank rules of that day in regard to their
ordinary action upon the circulation, since it is here that the
secret will be found, not only of the steadiness of value which
marked the currency during the first ten years of war, but
of its extraordinary fluctuations afterwards, --- fluctuations
which are quite inexplicable on the ordinary supposition of a
forced issue. It must be remembered that the usury laws
fixed the highest legal rate of interest at five %. The
Bank rule, during the whole period of Restriction, was to discount
at this rate all good mercantile bills offered, not having
more than sixty-one days to run; and in making these advances
the only duty which the directors considered themselves
obliged to observe was that of throwing out, so far as possible,
all bills which there was reason to believe represented speculative
transactions. In other respects the Bank was perfectly
passive. It neither contracted nor expanded its own issues,
but allowed the public demand to contract or expand the currency,
in the firm conviction that the public would not retain
more notes than it actually required. Naturally the demand
for discount at the Bank varied according to the market rate
of interest outside; and when private bankers lent money at
three %, comparatively few persons cared to pay five to
the Bank of England. During the early part of the war the
Bank rate was in fact almost always higher than that in the
open market, and consequently the Bank issues were moderate.
By a regularly self-balancing principle, the advances made to
government in an ordinary state of affairs diminished the private
demand, since the government at once paid away to the
public the notes it received from the Bank, and this money,
coming back to the private bankers, enabled them to extend
their discounts and to accommodate those merchants who
would otherwise have been obliged to apply to the Bank. It
is merely a theoretical question, what would have been the
result had government obliged the Bank to make excessive advances
on its account. In point of fact, the case did not
occur, and government contented itself with moderate accommodation;
while, as a rule, the private demands were greatest
when the advances to government were at the lowest point.

Thus the Bank was throughout a mere channel of credit.
It did not, and under these rules it could not, exercise any
direct control over its issues, and it conducted its business upon
much the same principles as would have regulated any sound
private banker, whether he issued notes or not. Its theory
excluded the idea that it was bound to regard the exchanges
or the price of gold, or to interfere in any way with the course
of business. Its sole duty was to lend capital, and it was for
the public and for each individual merchant to see that his
affairs were in a proper condition, that speculation was avoided,
that the exchanges were watched, or to take the consequences
of neglecting such obvious precautions.

And so long as each individual did observe a proper degree
of precaution, or until political difficulties or some other accidental
cause deranged the ordinary state of credit, these rules
of the Bank answered the purpose for which they were made.
But while the usury laws remained in force, any rise in the
market rate of interest was certain to precipitate the whole
body of merchants upon the Bank of England, and any crisis
which obliged private bankers to seek, instead of furnishing
credit, was sure to bring the whole nation to the counters of
the Bank. In either of these cases, therefore, the Bank was
liable to be driven into an excessive issue of its paper, and
extension of its credit. But it did not necessarily follow that
such an expansion would lead to a permanent increase of the
circulation. On the contrary, whenever the crisis was over,
and the rate of interest again had fallen below the Bank standard,
the demand for discount would naturally decline, and the
circulation would return to its normal state.

For two or three years after the war had been resumed,
everything went on in a sound and regular course. Great
Britain might have carried on hostilities indefinitely, had she
been subjected to no greater pressure. The currency retained
its value, and trade its regularity, but taxation was greatly
augmented and the cost of production increased. Prices
steadily rose, until they attained in 1805 almost as high a
range as ever afterwards. With the exception of grain, an
article peculiarly liable to be affected by accidental causes, it
appears that almost the whole rise in prices, which was afterwards
attributed to depreciation of currency, took place during
the first twelve or fifteen years of the war, when no
depreciation existed. Much of it occurred at a time when
paper was highest in credit, and there is no reason for supposing
that the same thing would not have equally happened,
even if the Bank had continued its specie payments.

This comparatively happy and prosperous state of affairs
was not destined to continue. While the English were waging
a cheap and effective war on the ocean and in the colonies,
while Nelson crushed the combined navies of France and Spain
at Trafalgar, and Wellington subdued the Mahrattas in India,
Napoleon reached Vienna, and, turning from Austerlitz to Berlin,
swept the whole of Germany into the hands of France.
From Berlin he turned to Russia, and at Friedland stopped
for the mere want of other countries to conquer.

Such successes promised little good to England. Napoleon
hastened to turn his new power against her. It was from Berlin,
in November, 1806, that he issued the famous decree declaring
the British Islands in a state of blockade, confiscating
English property wherever found, and prohibiting all intercourse
with the British nation. Russia joined the coalition in
the following year, and Sweden in 1809. Thus the Continent
was closed to English commerce.

Napoleon's decree was an outrage to international law, but
the Continental System thus enforced was a prodigious shock
to Great Britain. There seemed no end to the losses and
complications which it caused. Yet there was still one country
apparently beyond its reach, whose commerce was of inestimable
importance. The United States of America was still
an open market, and the Berlin Decree almost inevitably forced
the United States into the arms of England. The British government,
however, with characteristic fatuity, actually assisted
Napoleon to extend the Continental System even to America.
The Berlin Decree, and that of Milan which followed it, had
declared the British Islands to be in a state of blockade, and
ordered that no ship should enter any port under the control
of France, if she came from England, or even had touched
at England, or if any part of her cargo was English. The
British government retaliated in January, 1807, by issuing an
Order in Council interdicting the passage of vessels between
any two ports which were not open to British commerce; and
in November followed this up by declaring all ports closed to
the British flag to be in a state of blockade, and all vessels
trading to or from such ports, or carrying any produce of such
countries, to be, with their cargoes, lawful prize. The American
government responded to these outrages by interdicting
commerce with both England and France.

No ordinary review can undertake so difficult and complicated
a labor as that of fairly examining the various effects of
these measures on English credit and currency. That British
trade with the Continent was annihilated, that it was for a
time impossible to determine the course of exchange, and to
recover debts, was but the most obvious and immediate result.
No sooner did it become evident that the decrees were to be
rigorously enforced, than all articles for a supply of which
England depended on the Continent rose to speculative prices.
Flax, linseed, tallow, timber, Spanish wool, silk, hemp, even
American cotton, advanced in 1807 and 1808 to prices two or
three times those hitherto prevailing. And while one class
of imports was thus thrown wholly into the hands of speculative
holders, another class, consisting of all colonial produce,
underwent an exactly opposite process. The European market
was closed to it. Sugar and coffee were selling at Calais for
three, four, and five times their price at Dover. And meanwhile
the almost omnipotent naval force of Great Britain was
contributing, under the Orders in Council, to aggravate this
evil, and to pile up still vaster quantities of unsalable goods in
British warehouses, by compelling every neutral ship to make
for an English port.

A wild spirit of speculation now took possession of the British
people. Brazil and the South American colonies of Spain
happened at this moment to offer a new market, and merchants
flung themselves upon it as though it had no limit. The beach
at Rio Janeiro was for a time covered with English merchandise,
which there were no warehouses to hold, and which there
was no chance of selling. In London, a rage for visionary
joint-stock enterprises characterized the years 1807 and 1808.
None of the symptoms were wanting which long experience
has shown to be invariable precursors of commercial disaster.

The Bank of England, however, still preserved its steady
and conservative routine. The issues were not increased, the
price of gold did not vary, the exchanges had not fallen below
par, as late as September, 1808. So far as the Bank is concerned,
there is no indication that any unusual speculation
existed, or that it lent itself or was asked to lend itself to
speculative objects. It was not through the Bank that speculators
acted. But if we turn to the private and country bankers,
and, out of the almost impenetrable obscurity in which
this part of the subject is hidden, attempt to gather some evidence
of their condition, it will be found, not indeed that their
paper was depreciated,--- for that it could not be without immediately
bankrupting the issuer, --- but that their credit had
been extended far beyond any moderate limit. It was not
merely that the number of country banks had been more than
doubled in ten years. What was of greater consequence than
this was the change which had gradually crept into their mode
of conducting business. Originally their rules of discount had
been the same as those of the Bank of England; they accepted
only short bills, representing, so far as they could judge, real
transactions of business. They gradually began to make advances
upon bills of longer date, and then to lend money
without security of any kind. Paper which could not be discounted
in London was sent down to them by their London
agents. Their West Indian bills had from twelve to thirtysix
months to run. They made little inquiry as to what might
be accommodation paper, and still less as to the speculative
transactions of their customers. The reaction which ultimately
followed, at the very time when the Bank circulation
was greatly increased and increasing, proves the extent to
which private credit had been abused.

We have been led into this somewhat tedious account of
England's financial situation in 1807 and 1808, by the hope
of showing how critical her position was, and how inevitable a
collapse of credit had become. Down to this point, however,
the subject offers comparatively few difficulties. Beyond it,
the whole region has been made a favorite battle-ground for
armies of currency theorists. It is only within the last thirty
years that even a fair comprehension of the matters in dispute
has been made possible to the public, through the great work
of Mr. Thomas Tooke. The opinions first advocated, and the
facts first proved by the author of the "History of Prices,"
have since been accepted by some of the highest authorities in
political economy, of whom Mr. John Stuart Mill stands at the
head. That they are still hotly contested in England is a fact
which only adds to the interest of the inquiry.

It has already been stated, that down to September, 1808,
the exchanges remained favorable to England, and the price
of gold continued firm. During the first half-year, the average
Bank circulation had been £16,950,000. At the end of August,
£17,200,000 were in issue. These sums were not excessive.
If the small notes, which merely supplied the place
of coin withdrawn, are deducted, it appears that the real circulation
was but £12,993,000; less than had frequently been
in issue before, and considerably less than has always been in
issue since. The prices of all commodities, except grain, had
already reached their highest point, or reached it within six
months afterwards. It was at this time, when no change except
ordinary fluctuations had occurred in the currency for
seven years, that the exchanges suddenly turned, and the price
of gold rose.[^/243]

The Continental System had begun to act. The mercantile
ventures of the last year proved ruinous; the enormous importations
at fabulous prices required to be paid for; the
unfortunate military expeditions which Great Britain was now
renewing against the Continent demanded the transmission of
gold. England was paying money in every direction, and she
was selling her goods nowhere. No one watched this process
of exhaustion more carefully, or understood its consequences
better, than Napoleon himself.

The Bank, following its invariable routine of business, took
no notice of the sharp fall in exchanges, or of the heavy drain
which rapidly reduced its treasure, and, instead of contracting
its issues, allowed them slowly to expand, according to the
demand for discount. From £13,000,000 in 1808, the circulation
in notes of £5 and upwards rose to £ 14,325,000 in November, 1809. The exchanges indicated already a difference
of about fifteen % between paper and gold. Meanwhile
the government expenses requiring transmission of gold abroad
had increased to above £ 10,000,000 for the year. The excessive
prices of that class of goods which could only be obtained
from the Continent stimulated merchants into every possible
effort to procure them. Ships' papers were regularly forged as
a matter of business; licenses for trading were obtained at
great expense from both governments. Importations were by
these means greatly increased, and large quantities of grain
were brought in to supply an unusual deficiency in the harvest.
The receipts of cotton were more than doubled, and the market
was again overwhelmed with colonial produce. Thus no
opportunity was allowed for a recovery of the exchanges, and
the country continued to be drained steadily of its gold.

Throughout the year 1810 the same process was continued.
Again the importations were greatly increased, and the quantity
of grain brought from abroad was far in excess of what
had been imported in any year since 1801. Wellington was
now in the lines of Torres Vedras, requiring continual supplies
of gold. The military efforts made by England on the Continent
were greater than ever before, and the foreign expenditure
rose beyond £12,000,000 for the year. The exchanges continued
to fall, although at one time there was a tendency to
recovery. Gold remained at about the same premium as in
1809, while the government and the public equally increased
their demands on the Bank, until in August the circulation
of large notes rose to £17,570,000.

If irredeemable government paper had been forced upon the
public without regard to its wants, until within a space of two
years the currency had swelled from a total of £17,000,000
to one of £24,500,000, it scarcely admits of a doubt that the
result would have been a rise in prices and an increase of speculation.
According to all the old currency theories, such ought
now to have been the case with England. In fact, directly
the contrary result took place. During the last months of
1809 and the whole of 1810, a fall of prices and a destruction
of private credit occurred, which for severity remains perhaps
to this day without a parallel, as it was then without a precedent.
Half the traders in the kingdom became bankrupt, or
were obliged to compound. Country banks by dozens were
swept out of existence. Rich and poor alike were plunged in
distress, while the crash extended to the Continent and to
America. It was this universal collapse of credit which, by
driving the whole trading class for assistance to the Bank,
obliged the Bank to increase its issues. Nothing but an absolute
refusal of discounts could have prevented suspension, had
the Bank at this moment been paying its notes in specie. According
to one theory, the withdrawal of so much countrybank
paper should have restored gold to par, since it is very
improbable that the Bank issues supplied the vacancy. This
would no doubt have been the case, if the depreciation had
been, as is usually supposed, the result of over-issue; but in
fact the foreign debt of England was enormous; its immediate
payment was necessary; gold was the only exportable commodity,
and gold was not to be had. Mr. Baring declared in
the House of Commons, that, if his firm wished to obtain fifty
thousand pounds sterling for transmission abroad, he did not
know how such a sum was to be procured even at a premium
of fifty %. To export more bulky goods was simply
impossible. At this time the British merchant was sending
sugar by sea to Salonica, and thence on horseback through
Servia and Hungary, in order to reach Vienna; one parcel of
silk sent from Bergamo to England, by way of Smyrna, was
twelve months on its passage; another, sent by way of Archangel,
was two years. The British government attempted to
establish a smuggling depot at Heligoland, in order to overcome
the obstructions caused by the Continental System. A
single licensed cargo to a French port cost for freight alone
twenty times the cost of the vessel which carried it. Gold
alone was comparatively easy to export, and naturally bullion
rose in value.

In all this there is clear evidence of a terrible convulsion in
commerce, and no doubt of a previous excessive expansion in
credit, followed by as excessive contraction; but there is nothing
which indicates an excess of currency in the sense which
that phrase bears in regard to the effect of forced issues on
prices. Undoubtedly there was a depreciation of ten or fifteen
%, or even more, in paper as compared with gold, and
there may justly be a question whether the Bank was not
bound to restrict its issues till that difference was removed.
But so long as the usury laws remained in force, the Bank
could not act upon the exchanges by raising its rate of interest;
and to refuse accommodation would have been the ruin
of such merchants as had hitherto succeeded in surviving the
shock. Even had the Bank resorted to this desperate measure,
such was the preponderance of foreign payments over receipts
from abroad, that no possible pressure could have immediately
restored the balance of exchange. In ordinary times a monetary
crisis effects this resul by reducing prices and this making
it possible to export goods at a profit; but it is difficult to
see how any reduction of prices could have had such an effect
in 1810, since for years before that time it had been impossible
to obtain in Holland and Hamburg, even at three and four
times their English price, the goods which overwhelmed the
British market. The only result of Bank contraction, therefore,
must have been to stop importations. But in the first
place the general fall in prices was alone sufficient to produce
this result, as was proved in 1811. And, moreover, grain was
at famine rates; the people must be fed; the foreign expenditure
of the government also defied laws of political economy,
and Wellington's army in Portugal required millions in gold.
If, therefore, the Bank had attempted to. put a still more severe
pressure on the exchanges than already existed, it would
have found itself paralyzed by the government at its first step,
and in the struggle which must have followed the people would
have been ground into the dust. Even under the liberal system
adopted, there was a time, in 1811 and 1812, when the
general distress shook society to its foundations. Had the
Bank wilfully intensified and prolonged this distress, it is not
improbable that Napoleon's Continental System might, after
all, have proved the greatest success of his life.

The fall in foreign exchange during 1808 and 1809 did not
attract very much public attention until Mr. Ricardo published
a pamphlet on the subject,--- "The High Price of Bullion a
Proof of the Depreciation of Bank-Notes." Shortly after the
meeting of Parliament in 1810, a committee was appointed, at
the instance of Mr. Francis Horner, to investigate the causes
of the high price of gold bullion. This was the famous "Bullion
Committee," whose Report made so marked an era in
currency problems that it might almost be called their _pons
asinorum_. Its doctrines, rejected by Parliament in 1811 only
to be triumphantly adopted in 1819, acquired through the
conversion of Sir Robert Peel an overruling ascendency, and,
embodied in the Bank Charter Act of 1844, still hold sway in
England, although the more liberal economists have long since
protested against the application given to them.

We would willingly linger over the Bullion Report, if it were
possible to compress the subject within our limits; but this
great controversy does not allow of narrow treatment, and we
prefer to lay it aside. It was based upon three propositions:
first, that Bank paper was depreciated as compared with gold;
secondly, that this depreciation was caused by over-issues;
thirdly, that the price of gold and the state of foreign ex
change should regulate the issues of paper. And the Report
closed by recommending that the Bank should be obliged to
resume payments within two years.

Had the government been in the hands of able or dexterous
men, Mr. Horner's resolutions, in which the substance of his
Report was embodied, need not have been so difficult to deal
with as they proved. The first proposition was indeed incontrovertible,
and no sensible being could have fallen into the
blunder of disputing it. The third was, if not indisputable, at
least not necessary to dispute under certain limitations. But
the second was very far from evident in the sense which Mr.
Horner gave to it, and Mr. Thornton, perhaps the highest
authority in the House, appears not to have understood it as
absolutely excluding the idea that the depreciation might have
been due to a deeper cause; while the concluding practical
measure was supported by scarcely any one besides Mr. Horner,
its author.

But the government was held by a class of men equally incapable
of seeing their own mistakes, and of profiting by those
of their opponents. The Ministers began by plunging headlong
into the grossest absurdity they could have found. They
denied that Bank notes were depreciated at all. Assuming
that the sale of coin for more than its nominal value in paper
was forbidden by law, they undertook to affirm that the Bank
note and the guinea still maintained their relative worth in
regard to each other. They denied that bullion was the true
standard of value, and they affirmed that it was the stamp
and the stamp alone which made the guinea a standard. They
denied that the amount of circulation affected the price. of
gold, or that the Bank issues had anything to do with the
course of exchange. Yet at intervals they were obliged practically
to admit the very conclusions which they were so eager
to contest, until all their really accurate statements and forcible
reasoning became inextricably entangled and hidden from
sight in a confused mass of inconsistent arguments.

On the other hand, they had as opponents some of the ablest
men whom England has ever produced. It was pitiable to
watch the torture of Mr. Vansittart, Mr. Rose, and Lord Castlereagh,
in the grasp of Mr. Horner, Mr. Huskisson and Mr.
Canning. The mistakes of the bullionists are hidden by the
brilliancy of their oratory, the sparkle of their wit, the vigor
and solidity of their genius. Sympathy is irresistibly attracted
to their side, when it is seen what magnificent powers they
were obliged to use, in order to convince an unreasoning
majority of the simplest principles in practical business. And
yet, after all these efforts, they thought themselves fortunate
in being defeated by a vote of only two to one.

It would have been happy for Mr. Vansittart and his associates,
had they been willing to rest satisfied with this negative
upon the resolutions offered by Mr. Horner. Victorious in
defence, they thought it necessary to establish their advantage
permanently by a vigorous assertion of what they deemed the
true principles of credit and currency. Mr. Vansittart accordingly
moved, in his turn, a long series of resolutions.

The third of these has been the chief means of preserving
Mr. Vansittart's memory. It was worded as follows:--- "_Resolved_,
That it is the opinion of this committee that the promissory
notes of the Bank of England have hitherto been, and
are at this time, held in public estimation to be equivalent to
the legal coin of the realm, and generally accepted as such in
all pecuniary transactions to which such coin is lawfully applicable."

This position was beyond the reach of argument, but not of
ridicule. In the whole range of Parliamentary oratory, there
are few examples of sarcasm so happy as that which Mr. Canning
poured out upon this unfortunate resolution in his speech
of the 13th of May, 1811. But it was all in vain. The House
sustained Mr. Vansittart by a vote of 76 to 24; and from that
day to this the resolution has stood, an object of laughter and
wonder to each succeeding generation.

Thus the Bullion Committee was disposed of, but the subject
was further than ever from a satisfactory settlement. Within
two months of the passage of this resolution, in which Parliament
had gravely pledged the people to believe that Bank
notes were equivalent to coin, two events almost simultaneously
occurred, which obliged the government to take active
measures in order to compel the people to accept these same
Bank notes. The first of these difficulties was due to an unexpected
interpretation of the law. Two obscure individuals,
one a Jew pedler named De Yonge, the other a guard on the
Liverpool mail-coach, had been taken in the act of buying
guineas at a premium, --- an act supposed to be illegal, and,
like the exportation of coin, subjecting the delinquent to the
penalties of a misdemeanor. Government determined to make
an example of these persons, and they were accordingly indicted
under an obsolete statute of Edward VI., and, the facts
being clearly proved, they were duly found guilty of the acts
charged in the indictment. But their counsel raised the point
of law, that the act as laid in the indictment and proved in
evidence was not an offence in law, inasmuch as the statute
of Edward VI. was intended to apply only to the exchange of
one sort of coin for another. Judgment was respited until the
opinion of the twelve judges in the Court of the Exchequer
Chamber could be obtained on this point; but at length, on
the 4th of July, 1811, Lord Ellenborough pronounced the
unanimous decision of the Court, that the exchange of guineas
for bank-notes, such guineas being taken at a higher value than
they were current for under the King's proclamation, was not
an offence against the statute upon which the indictment was
founded. Thus the whole government theory in regard to
paper money was at once overthrown.

Almost at the same time with this blow, the famous third
resolution was attacked from another side with a vigor far
more alarming. It was well understood that the law of 1797
had by no means made Bank paper a legal tender. The case
of Grigby v. Oakes, in 1801, had established the principle that
Bank of England notes might be refused by the creditor, and
the debtor must in that case discharge his debt in coin. Practically,
however, the Bank note had been received as equivalent
to coin, except in some remote districts of Ireland, where
the unfortunate peasants were obliged to buy guineas at a
premium from the landlord, in order to discharge their rents.

The government policy, however, seemed purposely calculated
to challenge attack, and it was perfectly natural that the
bullionists, who saw no limit to the possible depreciation, should
resort to the last means now left for compelling government
to check it. Lord King, a nobleman of high character and
strong liberal principles, accordingly issued a circular to such
of his tenants as held leases dated before the depreciation
began, requiring them in future to pay their rents either in
gold or in Bank paper representing the market value of gold.
Even the dignity of the House of Lords was almost overthrown
by this unexpected attack. A storm of indignation burst on
the head of Lord King, whose practical sarcasm was more exasperating
to the Ministry than even the satire of Mr. Canning.
But Lord King was in his right; he was acting from conscientious
motives, and he would not yield. Yet, after the passage
of Mr. Vansittart's resolution, this act directly tended to bring
Parliament into public contempt. "My Lords," said Lord
Grenville, in opening his speech on the subject, "it is painful
to me to observe, that I cannot remember in the course of my
life to have ever seen the Ministers of this country placed in
so disgraceful a situation as that in which they appear this
night." Obviously some action had become necessary, and
yet Ministers hesitated, in the vague hope that Lord King's
example would not be followed. The judges' decision in De
Yonge's case, however, turned the scale; but even then, such
was the general dislike to a law of legal tender, and such was
the difficulty of forcing a contraction in the Bank discounts,
that they were placed in a most embarrassing situation. There
was apparently a third alternative, --- that of allowing Lord
King to proceed; but in fact this would have established two
scales of prices throughout the country, and the result would
ultimately have been that the Bank, rather than endure the
discredit thus attached to its paper, would have preferred to
withdraw it wholly.

The Ministers were saved from this dilemma by Lord Stanhope,
one of their ordinary opponents. He invented a measure
which is certainly one of the curiosities of legislation, ---
a measure which disposed of Lord King, and established the
law for such cases as that of De Yonge, but neither made
paper a legal tender, nor contained the trace of a legal principle.
The act, which has since been commonly known as Lord
Stanhope's, made the purchase or sale of coin for more than
its legal value in Bank notes or other lawful money a misdemeanor,
as also the reception or payment of notes for less than
their nominal value; and it further deprived the creditor of
the power of distraining, in case a tender in Bank notes to the
amount of the debt had been made.

Strange to say, this preposterous statute completely answered
its purpose. The courts seem never to have been
called upon to interpret it, nor did any creditor attempt to enforce
his rights. The law officers of the crown did not venture
to express any opinion upon the bill while on its passage
through Parliament. During the ten years that the Restriction
Act still remained in force, with this measure of Lord
Stanhope's as its supplement, no man in England really knew
what the law was as affecting the currency, or the extent to
which Bank notes were recognized as the lawful equivalent of
coin. In the failure of any judicial declaration on the subject,
we can only refer to an opinion expressed in debate by Sir
Samuel Romilly. That eminent lawyer pointed out to Parliament,
that, if the object of government were to prevent Lord
King or any other landlord or creditor from insisting upon
payment in coin, the bill was far from answering its purpose.
Creditors would still have the right to demand gold, and no
court could refuse in such a case to give judgment against
the debtor, who was yet apparently debarred by the act from
obtaining gold without incurring the penalties of a misdemeanor.
The creditor, having obtained his judgment, need
not, and probably would not, proceed by way of distraint upon
the goods of his debtor. If a landlord, he would resort to an
ejectment. In any case, however, he might proceed against
the person, and shut up the debtor in jail indefinitely, or until
he made himself liable to further imprisonment by purchasing
coin. There appears, however, to have been one means of escape
left open to him still. The law only prohibited the trade
in coin, not that in bullion. If the debtor, therefore, chose to
purchase bullion, and have it coined at the mint, there seems
to be no reason why he might not so have evaded the law.

Ministers, however, gave it to be understood that, if creditors
pressed their rights to this point, it would become necessary
for Parliament to intervene by making Bank notes a legal
tender. It is difficult to see precisely what was gained to the
country by a resort to these absurd subterfuges, or why a legaltender
act should not have been passed outright, since Lord
Stanhope's bill was intended to have, and did in fact produce,
the same effect, except that it went much beyond the limits
of reasonable legislation, and accomplished its purposes only
by creating a new offence hitherto unknown to the law. The
plea that it successfully met the emergency is merely an excuse
for slovenly legislation.

This act, hurried through Parliament in July, 1811, just at
the close of the session, was the sole result of the currency
controversy, unless Mr. Vansittart's resolutions are worthy of
sharing its credit. From this time it became evident that no
interference by government in monetary matters was to be
looked for, but that the Bank was to retain that exclusive
control which it had hitherto possessed. This result was
probably fortunate for the country. The Bank directors, if
not great masters of statesmanship, were at least convinced
that any arbitrary action of their own would only aggravate the
evils of the situation, while, if the foreign and domestic policy
of the government in other respects furnishes any idea of the
probable result of its interference in Bank affairs, there is no
disaster which it might not have brought upon the credit and
resources of the community.

The great financial crash of 1809 and 1810 threw the
country into a state of profound distress and depression, but
it had the effect of preparing the way for a rapid change at
the first sign of military success. The year 1811 marked
perhaps the lowest point of England's fortunes; but in the
autumn of that year the prospect became brighter. Napoleon
had now broken with Russia, and was preparing his great
campaign to Moscow, while Wellington had achieved unusual
success in Portugal. There was hope that both the Russian
and the Spanish ports would soon be reopened, while the
colonies and South America were actually consuming again
large quantities of British goods. Importations into England
had meanwhile fallen to a very low point, and the exchanges
were slowly creeping upwards. The pressure upon the Bank
for assistance and for discounts fell off as credit recovered
itself, until the circulation, which had reached £17,570,000 in
August, 1810, contracted itself to £15,365,000 in August,
1812, the small notes excluded.

What was only hope in 1811 became certainty in 1812.
Napoleon was driven both from Russia and from Spain. In
another year all Europe was again open to British commerce,
and in April, 1814, peace was restored. During this period,
many of the dangerous symptoms of 1807 and 1808 again
made their appearance; the circulation had become much
smaller, but nevertheless prices rose; speculation was as general,
if not so desperate, as in 1808; the Continent was flooded
with English goods, while in England itself the price of wheat
had risen, in 1812, to nearly 160 shillings the quarter.

But although the circulation was diminished by £2,000,000.
although public confidence was so far restored that prices gen
erally rose, although the exchanges became considerably more
favorable, still gold showed no sign of falling in value. The
premium had risen to forty-two % in September, 1812,
and after various fluctuations it was again forty-two %
in the autumn of 1813. Then at last the fall began, and for
a twelvemonth gold continued to decline steadily, until, at the
close of 1814, the premium was less than twelve %.
And it should be remarked that the rise in value of Bank
paper was coincident with another very large extension of
issues, which now reached £18,700,000.

This extension was due partly to government, but partly,
as in 1810, to the private demand. The whole fabric which
speculators had raised for themselves on the apparently solid
basis of supposed European necessities had crumbled to pieces
at the first shock. Europe was too poor to buy or too thoroughly
plundered to pay for English merchandise. The speculations
abroad failed at the very time when a prodigious
fall in the price of grain ruined the English farmers and the
country bankers, who depended upon agricultural prosperity.
The collapse was general and disastrous; England was again
plunged into distress at the very time when her success was
most brilliant; for two years after 1814, trade stagnated and
merchants became bankrupt, without the slightest reference
to the price of gold or the amount of circulation; nor is there
any reason to suppose that the Bank could have prevented, or
even shortened, the distress by any action upon the currency.

However devoted might be the adherence of theorists to
their own favorite currency dogma, the most ardent follower
of Mr. Horner could scarcely have regretted that the principles
of the bullion report had not been made obligatory as a
rule of action for the Bank during the year 1815. The evils
of inconvertible paper are no doubt many, but there are also
advantages in the system during times of political trouble;
and it is impossible to deny that the violent convulsions of
1815 would have proved too severe a trial for any but the
most elastic form of credit. During January and February,
gold had stood at about 115, as compared with paper. The
Emperor returned from Elba and arrived in Paris on the 20th
of March. The next quotation of gold is on the 4th of April,
when at one leap it rose to 137, almost as high a point as it
had reached during the war. The exchanges went down with
almost equal violence; but the Bank circulation remained
absolutely stationary. After the first panic was over, gold
began again to fall slowly, and on the news of Waterloo it declined
to 128; on the 1st of September it resumed the position
it had held in January; but instead of resting there, it
continued to fall, until at the close of the year the premium
was only five %; and in July, 1816, it was nothing at
all, or at most only about one %. The Bank circulation
meanwhile expanded or contracted itself according to the
demand, averaging rather more than £17,500,000, exclusive
of the small notes.[^/256]

The equilibrium was therefore restored, and it was restored
without interference by government. The system vindicated
itself, and is justly entitled to the high credit that properly
belongs to so brilliant a success. But, unfortunately, this
very success has given occasion for another hot dispute among
currency writers, involving the whole question in its historical
as well as in its theoretical bearings; and tedious as the subject
may be, we are obliged again to turn aside, and to examine
the opposing theories so obstinately and positively advanced.

It is almost needless to repeat that there were in 1816, and
that there still are, two classes of political economists, so far
as the currency is concerned. The one has found in bank
paper and its over-issues an explanation for every rise or fall
in prices, and for every financial disaster. The other has
denied to such a medium of exchange any influence whatever
upon prices, and insists that, if every bank-note were destroyed,
speculation and abuses of credit would flourish not
less than now. The bullionists of 1810 and their successors
were strong in the belief that the Bank issues did control
prices, and the price of gold especially. They were, therefore,
obliged to explain how it happened that gold fell to par, or
about forty %, while the Bank issues were actually increased.
Obviously the dilemma was serious.

The bullionists, however, had a reply, and a very reasonable
one; we quote it as given by Mr. McCulloch, whose opinion is
always entitled to weight. Mr. McCulloch's theory is, that,
although no contraction of Bank issues occurred which could
explain the fall in gold, yet there was such a contraction in
the entire circulation, taking the country banks into the calculation;
and that the rise in value of Bank of England
paper was in fact due to the destruction of country banknotes
during the disastrous years of 1814, 1815, and 1816.
And if the inquiry be carried a step further by seeking the
cause of these disasters themselves, Mr. McCulloch explains
that the fall of grain from 155 shillings the quarter, in 1812,
to 67 shillings, in 1814, had spread universal ruin among the
agricultural class.

We are far from affirming positively that so natural and so
obvious an explanation as this is not the correct one; yet we
are obliged to confess that the view taken by Mr. Tooke and
Mr. Fullarton appears to our eyes more philosophical and
more exact than that of Mr. McCulloch. They maintained
that the fall in gold was due simply to the fact that, with the
final turn of exchange in favor of England, gold ceased to be
an object of demand, and, like other commodities in the same
position, rapidly fell to its ordinary value.

Mr. McCulloch's facts are unquestioned, but they appear to
be only a part of the truth. The prodigious decline in the
price of grain was coincident with a very general decline in
prices, which naturally checked importations and stimulated
export. The grain alone which was imported in 1814 is estimated
at £ 2,800,000 in value: in 1815 it was but £800,000,
and in 1816 only £940,000. Silk and wool, coffee, flax, linseed,
and most of the great staples of import, fell off in the
same way between 1814 and 1816. Under any circumstances
the exchanges must have risen without regard to the currency,
and gold must have fallen, since considerable sums were actually
brought from abroad during 1815 and 1816.

The force of this argument becomes evident by compariscn
with previous cases. If the rise in exchange and the appreciation
of paper in 1815 and 1816 were caused by the withdrawal
of private bank-notes, the same reason should hold
good for the similar events in 1814. If at the later time the
currency were so depreciated from excess as to regain its value
only by contraction, it was certainly more in need of that relief
at the earlier. Yet a fall of thirty % in gold was
then coincident with an increase of paper throughout the
country.

Allowing, however, that Mr. McCulloch is right, and that
the restoration of paper was caused by involuntary contraction,
that contraction was at all events only temporary, and the reestablishment
of the credit of the country banks of issue should
have renewed the depreciation. The Bank issues rose in 1817
and 1818 to a higher point than ever before, and the country
banks had again extended their credit in every direction.
Under these circumstances, the depreciation should have been
very great, even after every reasonable allowance had been
made; yet in fact gold was at a premium of only about five
%, and this slight advance appears to have been caused
merely by a temporary pressure on the foreign exchanges
which will presently be explained.

If these arguments seem still insufficient to show that the
theory of excessive issues does not fully meet the difficulties
of the case, we can only compare the circulation of 1814 and
1815, which is said to have lost twenty % or more of
its value through its excess, with that which existed after specie
payments were resumed. Such comparisons are not a fair
proof of either excess or deficiency, since the public demand
varies, and the same amount of circulation is at one time less.
and at another more than is required. Allowing for such
variations, we may still venture to compare the three different
periods of general expansion between 1813 and 1825. The
small notes having been withdrawn at the resumption, and
their place supplied by coin, it is necessary to exclude these
in each case.

The highest point reached by the Bank circulation in any
quarterly average between 1812 and 1815 was £19,067,000
in the third quarter of 1814; the price of gold being about 112. Between 1816 and 1822, the highest average was in
the second quarter of 1817, or £21,517,000, and it remained
above £ 20,000,000 until July, 1818, the country banks expanding
generally. Gold was then at about 105. Between
1823 and the close of 1825, the highest average was in the
first quarter of 1825, a time of universal expansion, when it
reached £20,665,000, the Bank redeeming its notes in coin.

If, then, two thirds or three fourths of the whole depreciation
was removed in 1814 without any withdrawal of paper;
if the circulation was restored to its widest range in 1818
without any effect of consequence upon the price of gold; and
if, after the resumption, the circulation remained undiminished
in amount, and its issue subject to the same general laws as
before, --- there seems to be no necessity for resorting to the
theory of involuntary contraction in order to explain the fall
of gold in 1816. There is no reason to dispute that theory,
if it is understood to mean merely that this contraction was
itself a part of a general movement of trade and credit, and
as such that it contributed to hasten the result. But if more
than this is intended, it appears to us that the effect produced
was entirely out of proportion to the cause assigned.

The whole subject of private banking, for many years assigned
as the source of all financial troubles, has in fact very
little to do with the question of depreciation during the
French wars. The country banks held then precisely the
same position they had held before suspension, nor did the
resumption change it. They never suspended payments. At
any time gold might have been demanded for their notes. At
all times they did in fact redeem their notes on demand, by
exchanging them for those of the Bank of England. Their
circulation, therefore, was limited by that of the Bank, and
the same general laws controlled the whole.

Country bank paper could not have been in excess of the
public wants then, any more than it could now be, although
the credit of such banks might be, and no doubt was, abused
then, as it may be now. On the other hand, the Bank of
England was not obliged to redeem its notes. There is no
doubt that, through the channel of permanent loans to government,
it might have forced any given amount of paper into
circulation, had it chosen to do so. But it did not force a
single note upon the public. It lent notes, but never paid
them away.
At the end of two months every such loan had
to be paid back into the coffers of the Bank by the borrower;
and although the advances to government were to some degree
permanent, in the first place they were not excessive, and in
the second place, as has been already shown, they tended directly
to lower the private demand. Whatever action may
have been caused by the Restriction was upon credit in the
first place, and not upon currency. The encouragement it
may have afforded to speculation could not, however, have
been very great, or ten years would not have passed without
showing it. But when taxes, bad seasons, or the operations
of war, or other causes, combined to raise prices and to stimulate
speculation, the credit system was not then, nor is it now,
adapted to check the rise. And when a stagnation in business
and a fall in prices followed, as was sure ultimately to be the
case, the circulation contracted as a necessary consequence.
But in every instance, before the resumption and since, the
rise in prices has preceded the expansion, and the fall has preceded
the contraction.

In the early part of 1817 the supply of bullion in the Bank
had risen to £10,000,000, the average total circulation for
the quarter being somewhat in excess of £27,000,000, while
the exchanges were considerably above par. The directors,
therefore, considered it safe to try the experiment of partial
resumption, and by a series of steps taken during this year
they undertook to redeem all notes dated previous to the 1st
of January. This was, in fact, resumption. During the next
two years any holder of Bank notes could obtain gold for
them at the Bank, either directly, or by exchanging them for
such as were dated previous to the 1st of January, 1817.
There is no reason to doubt that, had the exchanges remained
firm, there would have been no further question as to an easy
and regular return to the normal condition of the currency.

But, unfortunately, the year 1817 was one of renewed speculation,
and the imports again rose to an extravagant point.
Grain alone to the value of £17,300,000 was brought into
England in the two years 1817 and 1818. Another cause
which could not well have been foreseen tended powerfully to
depress the exchanges and to carry gold abroad. Nearly all
the governments of Europe were at this time borrowing large
sums of money, and the English capitalists negotiated several
of their largest loans. How much money was sent abroad for
this purpose it is not easy to say, but certainly not less than
£10,000,000. The effect upon exchange was immediate, yet
the extreme variation in gold was not more than five %,
although no effort of any kind was made to counteract the
pressure. So far from resorting to the theory of excessive issues
for an explanation of this temporary rise in gold, one may well
feel surprise that, under the circumstances, there was not a
much greater disturbance of the market. The return of
peace must have largely increased English resources, to enable
them to bear so easily the pressure of enormous foreign payments.

But even the slight variation of five % which did
exist was not of long duration. Again in 1819, as before in
1816 and in 1814, the system vindicated itself without artificial
pressure, by the mechanical operation of its own laws.
The excessive importations of 1817 and 1818 resulted in stagnation
of business and decline in prices. The foreign loans
were discharged. The exchanges, relieved from pressure, rose.
The demand for gold ceased, and in July, 1819, the Bank
note was again at par. There it remained thenceforward, and
from that day to this there has been no depreciation in the
value of Bank of England paper.[^/262]

In the mean while, however, Parliament had taken alarm.
The Bank directors, after paying out £4,000,000 in redemption
of their notes under the conditions specified in 1817, seeing
no immediate prospect of a rise in exchange, and fearful
of the entire exhaustion of their treasure, applied to Parliament
early in 1819 to be relieved from the further performance
of their own promises of redemption. Committees were
appointed by both Houses, whose first act was to renew the
Restriction in its whole extent. Then, with a view to the final
establishment of a fixed government policy in regard to resumption,
the two committees entered into a separate and
most extended investigation of the whole subject, resulting in
two reports made in the course of April and May, which, with
the accompanying evidence, fill an enormous volume, and still
furnish a mass of readable matter not less interesting than
bulky. We are obliged to omit any detailed examination of
these papers, and of the Parliamentary debates that followed
them; but it is impossible to close this history without some
slight analysis of the measures finally adopted.

Mr. Peel, afterwards the celebrated Prime Minister, was
chairman of the House committee. Hitherto an opponent of
the bullionists, his opinions were changed by the testimony
offered before his committee, and he became a convert to the
doctrines which Mr. Horner and his friends had so ably advocated
in 1810. He carried almost his whole party with him.
It was now generally acknowledged in Parliament that Bank
paper was depreciated in regard to gold, and that a forcible
contraction would restore the equilibrium. This principle,
therefore, lay at the basis of his report.

The most serious resistance to resumption now came, however,
from a new party, which made an alarming use of this
doctrine of depreciation. It was affirmed, and probably with
truth, that the trifling difference between paper and gold was
no measure of the actual depreciation in paper as compared
with commodities generally. The rise in prices during the war
had been, it was argued, as much as fifty or one hundred % upon the old scale. A return to the original standard
would be a flagrant injustice to the community. The fundholders
alone would be benefited by it, and the people would
be ground down by additional taxes solely in order to pamper
the wealthy capitalist. If Parliament were determined to restore
specie payments, it should at least create a new standard,
and reduce the value of sterling money by twenty-five %; or it should accompany the resumption by allowing an
equivalent deduction to every debtor on the amount of his
debt. In other words, a general repudiation to the extent of
twenty-five % was demanded by a party which contained
some leading and influential members of Parliament not in any
way inclined to act the part of demagogues.

The House of Commons was, however, faithful to one main
principle, in which it justly considered the national honor to be
involved. The Restriction had been a war measure merely.
Since peace had been restored, Parliament, while consenting
to renew the law from year to year, had repeatedly pledged itself
to ultimate resumption. Every government loan had been
raised on the faith of these pledges; the interest of the national
debt had been paid in paper, on the ground of its equivalence
to gold; every public or private debt since 1797 had
been contracted under the influence of acts of Parliament
prescribing the time of resumption; every Bank note bore a
promise to pay upon its face. Four years had already been
allowed to pass, and nothing had yet been done. It was felt
that any further concession either to public timidity or to class
interests would endanger the national credit, if indeed it did
not proclaim a criminal dishonesty in those to whom the
duties of legislation were intrusted.

All resistance, therefore, to the principle of resumption in
its purest and simplest form was summarily swept aside. Yet
it is curious to observe with what excessive caution Mr. Peel
proceeded, and how clumsy and ponderous an engine he thought
it necessary to invent in order to bring about a very simple
result. At the time when his committee was sitting, there
was a premium of about five % upon gold, and his object
was to restore fully the equilibrium between paper and coin in
the first place, and in the second to create a system unde
which it should be impossible for paper to fall again below par.
The latter purpose could, as he believed, be effected by establishing
the principle that the circulation should be forcibly
contracted as the exchanges became unfavorable, or, in other
words, that the Bank should diminish its issues whenever its
treasure was diminished. But as the Bank directors were obstinate
in denying the efficacy of this contrivance, Mr. Peel
undertook to frame his bill in such a manner as to leave them
no option but to follow out his theory.

The project, therefore, began by an order for the repayment
by the government of ten millions out of the twenty-three
millions advanced to it by the Bank. This repayment was not
made, however, for the purpose of necessarily contracting the
Bank loans or issues, but because the Bank could more easily
control its circulation when made in short private loans, than
when made in more permanent advances to government, and
would, therefore, be more able to act energetically should a
fall in the exchanges threaten the success of the plan.

Having thus removed one possible impediment, Mr. Peel's
next step was to move the following resolution : "That from
the 1st of February, 1820, the Bank shall be liable to deliver
cn demand gold of standard fineness, having been assayed and
stamped at his Majesty's mint, a quantity of not less than
sixty ounces being required in exchange for such an amount
of notes by the Bank as shall be equal to the value of the
gold so required, at the rate of £4 1s. per ounce"; that is to
say, any person presenting Bank notes to the amount of £ 243
at the Bank counter should receive in return a bar of gold
worth £233. After the 1st of October he was to pay only
£238 for the same quantity of gold, and after the 1st of May,
1821, the ingot of sixty ounces was to be purchasable at its
par value in notes. After this experiment had been fully tried
during a space of two years, the Bank was, on the 1st of May,
1823, to commence the redemption of its notes in coin.

Such was the famous bill of Mr. Peel, which excited the
warmest controversies during a whole generation. So far as
its ultimate purpose of effecting an unconditional return to
specie payments is concerned, it deserves all praise; but we
cannot think that the merits of Mr. Peel's bill, as a practical
measure, were very great, or that, apart from its general tendency,
it either did or could exercise any great influence on
the result. A simple resolution requiring the Bank to resume
on a certain day would have answered the purpose better.

In the first place, the elaborate mechanism by which the
price of gold was to be forced down was based upon an official
acknowledgment of depreciation, the Bank note being made
the legal equivalent of a smaller sum in gold than that named
upon its face. It is true that no actual coin was to pass, but
the gold ingots were as much coin as if they had been guineas.
To reverse the whole policy of the war, and at this late moment
to proclaim that the government had for years steadily
cheated its creditors by paying them in depreciated paper, was
unnecessary, and, as we believe, wrong in principle.

In the second place, the radical difficulty with Peel's bill
was, that if its provisions had been tested, --- had the event
occurred which they were designed to provide for, --- they
would probably have proved useless. We have no space to
enter on the wide controversy still raging in England on this
point as connected with Sir Robert Peel's Bank Charter Act
of 1844; but there are few admirers of that act who can deny
that the theory of regulating the currency by the movements
of exchange does not and cannot exclude very violent fluctuations
in credit,--- in fact, that it for the time aggravates them.
Had the exchanges, therefore, become unfavorable in 1820, as
they did in 1825, no amount of contraction could have saved
the specie of the Bank. If, therefore, in the face of such a
drain, the Bank had undertaken to increase it by selling gold
two % cheaper than before, as Peel's act required, there
is every reason to believe that it would have again broken
down.

As Mr. Ricardo pointed out to Parliament, its duty was to
establish the principle, but it was for the Bank to carry that
principle out in action. Mr. Peel's act was not merely for the
resumption of specie payments; it was also one for the regulation
of commerce and credit; it undertook to control both the
currency and the exchanges. Such efforts have hitherto always
failed, and we can see no reason for supposing that this
one would have been more successful than the rest. The
really valuable part of the bill was that which fixed a day for
the resumption, and that which repealed the penal statutes
against melting or exporting coin. Had all the rest been
omitted, the measure would have been greatly improved.

Whatever may have been the theoretical merits or demerits
of the scheme, in actual practice it was wholly inoperative.
Within a few months of its adoption, and without any operation
upon the currency, gold again fell to par, and there it has
since remained. The Bank prepared its bars of bullion, but no
one would have them. On the contrary, large amounts of gold
were brought into its vaults. Weary of prolonging an obviously
useless delay, the directors applied to Parliament early
in 1821, and procured the passage of a new act, under which
cash payments were at length entirely resumed on the 1st of
May of that year. The public was unconscious of the event.
The Bank system was not altered, nor was the circulation
diminished, except so far as sovereigns were substituted for
notes of one and two pounds; and after twenty-four years of
an irredeemable paper currency, Great Britain returned smoothly
and easily to its ancient standard, and redeemed its pledged
honor.

There was, however, between the years 1818 and 1822, a
general and severe fall in prices, which was then, and is still,
commonly referred to the action of Mr. Peel's bill. There
may be a certain degree of truth in this theory, since the certainty
of resumption would very possibly inspire for the time
a salutary cautiousness in the extension of general credit.
But in truth there were other causes which tended much more
strongly to produce the same result. The agricultural class,
which uttered the loudest complaints, had, under the influence
of an excessive stimulus, brought more land under cultivation
than was required by the public wants, and a long time passed
before a proper equilibrium was again established. The shipping
interest was in much the same condition. But the population
at large did not suffer. On the contrary, it does not
admit of doubt that the condition of the mass of Englishmen
steadily improved after 1817. At the very time when prices
were falling, the manufacturing interests were rapidly extending
and enriching themselves; we hear less and less of political
discontent and internal disorder, as reviving prosperity
brought with it social repose, while even among the bankers
and traders there were far fewer bankruptcies during the three
years ending in 1821 than in any similar period since 1809.
If the resumption was to be held responsible for the misfortunes
of certain branches of industry, common justice requires
that the general prosperity of others should outweigh the
complaint; but if the views which we have taken are correct,
both complaint and praise were equally thrown away, and the
system after resumption was identical with that which had
existed before. The only effect of the long suspension was to
breed a race of economists who attributed an entirely undue
degree of power to mere currency, and who for years to come
delayed a larger and more philosophical study of the subject,
by their futile experiments upon paper money.

We will not undertake to apply England's experience to other
cases of depreciation, though no richer field could be wished.
But we reiterate, in concluding this review, that a wide distinction
must be drawn between inconvertible bank-notes, issued
on good security merely as loans, payable within a short definite
period, and inconvertible government paper, issued like so
much gold or silver, yet not capable of being melted like the
precious metals into an article of commerce, nor of being returned
to the issuer and not again borrowed, like bank-notes.
In one case the public regulates the supply by its own wants;
in the other, it is compelled to regulate prices by the supply.
No country laboring under the latter difficulty can draw consolation
from England's example. But if, in addition to the
£60,000,000 which we will suppose to have circulated in
British paper during the last ten years of Restriction, there
had been another £60,000,000 of government currency forced
upon the public, and if the private banks of issue had been
under a less rigorous central control, in this case there might
indeed be some parallel between the difficulties of resumption
in 1821 and those under which other nations have been
weighed down. But in this case, too, we may freely venture
to disbelieve that the return to cash payments on the old system
would have been so easily brought about; and if England
had, after all, succeeded in ultimately restoring her credit, if
she had redeemed her pledges and vindicated her honor, she
would have accomplished more than any nation has yet done,
although many have been placed in a similar situation.
