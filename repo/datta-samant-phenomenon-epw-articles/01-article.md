# The Datta Samant Phenomenon

Datta Samant has been the most
talked of, enigmatic and controversial
trade union leader in Maharashtra in
the past few years. Working class activity
in Bombay has come to be equated
with the ventures of Datta Samant.
His involvement in long drawn out
struggles, the militant following he
commands and the bloody inter-union
rivalries he has been associated with
provide ideal ingredients for sensational
news items. The struggles of the workers
in the post-Emergency period in
Maharashtra have by and large been
portrayed as the struggles of Datta
Samant.

## THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT

On July 30, 1980, during a fortnight
when every organisation was organising
demonstrations in Bombay, Samant led
the largest of the turnouts, called the
'long march'. The Minister for Labour
stated in the Assembly on August 5,
1980 that Samant was involved in 26
work stoppages out of 87 in the state
(as on August 4, 1980), representing,
16,401 out of the 27,322 affected
workers. On August 10, 1980 Samant
was arrested in connection with the
murder of two persons of Crompton
and Greaves. On August 18, 1980
several thousand workers defied prohibitory
orders to organise a protest rally
against his arrest. Upon his release on
bail, at a press conference on August
29, he hailed the chief minister's efforts
to settle long-standing labour disputes
in the state. By the middle of September
most work stoppages that he was
involved in were resolved (on the chief
minister's terms) giving rise to rumours
about a political deal between the
chief minister and Samant.

Samant continues to be in the news,
as controversial and enigmatic as ever.
The intensity of the reactions he
evokes is striking. His name signifies
hope for workers and terror for managements.
Adored by workers, he is
hated and maligned by managements
--- both sections being equally vehement
and illogical. The responses of
the media are equally varied, ranging
from explicitly anti-Samant write-ups to
cautious appraisals to devoted panegyrics
(see, for example, _Bombay_, September
7, 1980; _Sunday_, September 7, 1980;
and _Business Standard_, September 15,
1980). Most of these passionate responses
do not, however, take us very
much nearer to an understanding of the
'Samant phenomenon'.

The 'Samant phenomenon' is a part
and parcel of the history of the struggle
of the working class, particularly in
Bombay. It can only be understood
in that context. This exercise is also
necessary to correct the peculiar conscious
or unconscious distortions created
by various commentators in the
media.

A leader, an organisation, a phase of
struggle are all products of a particular
situation. They are representative,
in their strengths and their limitations,
of the mood, problems, aspirations and
consciousness of the workers. In short.
they are indicative of the stage of the
class struggle in its totality. The socioeconomic
situation, the political atmosphere,
the attitudes of managements,
the extent of organisation in different
sectors, the levels of investment and
technology in different sectors, the
rights and privilege already secured by
workers and the general nature of demands,
the will and ability of the State
to intervene effectively in industrial
disputes as well as the nature and
extent of political and moral sanctions
it commands, the prevalent political/
ideological influences on different
classes --- all shape and condition the
specificities of struggles in a particular
phase. The organisation, leader or
form of struggle which becomes generalised
widely enough to constitute a
'wave' in a particular situation reflects
the characteristics of the struggle in
that phase. Having gained a hold it
too obviously contributes to the further
elaboration, characterisation and progress
of the struggle.

Datta Samant is said to have entered
the trade union field in 1964. He has
been a prominent part of it since 1972.
The phase he did really represent was,
however, the post-Emergency phase.
He symbolised the mood and struggles
of the workers most authentically after
March 1977. To comprehend Datta
Samant is to also comprehend this particular
phase of workers' struggles in
and around Bombay.

A brief recapitulation of the earlier
'waves' and phases of the working class
movement in Bombay would be helpful
in this connection.

The early years of independence saw
only the textile and railway workers as
the main organised force. The relatively
new engineering industry had
granted no rights to its workers. The
workers had to launch bitter struggles
to win the right to unionise. The union
to lead them was the AITUC. Braving
legal attacks from the State, ideological
ones from the ruling party and physical
ones from the ruling party's trade
union wing, the workers under the
leadership of the AITUC heroically
laid the foundations of trade union
organisations in the city. Wages were
low, monetary gains perhaps not spectacular;
however, the struggles were
militant, bitter, violent and at times
expensive. This fred flag wave in the
face of extremely adverse conditions,
characterised by hostile non-acceptance
of unionisation by most managements,
did pioneering work of basic organisation.

## PERIOD OF LEGALISM

Conditions had begun to change in
about a decade after independence.
Industrialisation was proceeding at a
steady pace, the economic situation was
relatively stable, profits were mounting,
new vistas were opening up for the
capitalists. They were in a mood to
grant some concessions to the workers,
to accept the fact of unionisation and
to resolve disputes in a peaceful and
legal manner. They were keen to continue
and increase production (at the
enterprise level) and to prevent a consolidation
of the working class forces
(at the political level). The communist-led
unions found themselves in this
phase under manifold attack. The
1962 border conflict with China became
the excuse for State and ideological
attacks, as on the one hand a
cry of treachery was raised and on the
other most militant activists were thrown
in jails. This was ironically also the
era of stabilisation and consolidation of
unions. It was also the era of legalism,
of recourse to State conciliation
machinery and of productivity deals.
Patriotism and 'free' and 'responsible'
trade unionism were the key words.
R J Mehta's leadership personified this
phase of consultationism, collaborationism
and legalism. While the workers
embraced his unions, managements
welcomed him and government promoted
him. R J Mehta identified with
the AFL-CIO philosophy, was avowedly
anti-communist and openly in favour
of increasing production (see _Sunday_
September 7, 1980). His Engineering
Mazdoor Sabha was in this phase the
leading trade union.

The mid-sixties (1963--1967 particularly)
saw George Fernandes as the
most prominent leader of Bombay
workers. Capitalist expansion was slowing
down, bourgeois promise was wearing
thin, Congress popularity was
rapidly declining. The mood was once
again of militancy. Newer sections of
workers were becoming organised and
insisting on their rights. George
Fernandes was the leader above all of
service sector workers.

This was also a complex and heterogeneous
period. The chemical/petrochemical
industry was expanding. A
new era of high technology and educated,
young, often second generation
and skilled workers was dawning upon
Bombay, which was now the indisputed
industrial/commercial centre of the
country. The newer industries were
also in a position to give relatively
liberal concessions and privileges to its
workers. Company-based unions, isolated
from the general organisations and
struggles of the workers, were being
promoted. Non-militant, professionalised,
skilled unionists, usually under the
INTUC (eg, Raja Kulkarni)were advancing.
In the older industries, which
were facing a rather difficult time, the
communists were regaining their hold. In
fact, formation of CITU was providing
a channel for new militancy.

## SHIV SENA WAVE

1967 to 1972 were years of a greatly
deviationist and disastrous wave, that of
the Shiv Sena. The thrust of the Shiv
Sena was anti-communist. Its aim was
the destruction of communist-led
unions. With the aid of militant
chauvinism, financed by industrialists
and secretly blessed by the government,
this semi-fascist organisation
mounted attacks on communists and
indulged in violent terrorist strikebreaking.
'At one line it commanded
the following of more than 400 factories
in Bombay, to succeed in its major
aim of wrecking the AITUC.

The next wave to hit the city was
that of Datta Samant. In its evolution
it proved to be different from the earlier
waves in respect of many characteristics.
The militancy, ideology, populism, tactics,
organisational features and above
all worker support it generated were
markedly different.

Datta Samant burst upon the Bombay
trade union scene with the famous
Godrej incident of 1972. Till then he
was one of many trade unionists, engaged
as he was in organising stone quarry
workers. Well known, respected and
admired by the quarry workers and
slum dwellers in principally Ghatkopar
(a north-eastern suburb of Bombay lying
in the industrial belt), Samant was
essentially a helpful medical practitioner-social worker  with a local area as his
sphere of influence. Though a member
of the Congress (he had shifted over
during the 1971 Indira Gandhi wave)
he was not considered a primarily
political person. He became noteworthy
almost overnight with the Godrej incident.

Characteristically the Godrej incident
seems to have embraced all the
features which became the hallmarks
of the Samant wave' later (with one
notable exception, as will be seen later).
Militancy, direct mass action, disregard
for legal proprieties and challenge to
an established union were the elements
of the Godrej incident. In a dramatic
confrontation with the Shiv Sena, the
established force in the Godrej factories,
a major riot broke out resulting in the
death of (among others) a police officer.
Datta Samant was arrested and denied
bail. The responsibility for the violence
was sought to be pinned on Samant and
his followers. In a great show of unity,
the workers of north-east Bombay
launched an agitation against the governmen't
policies of intimidation and
terrorisation. The communist-led unions
were the leading sponsors of this action.
The Shiv Sena had been opposed
before, but this was an incident of
great significance in which its terror had
been fought back vehemently and it
had been at the receiving end.

## EMERGENCE OF DATTA SAMANT

With the accompanying publicity
Datta Samant became a trade union
hero almost overnight. After his release,
he began a campaign for expanding
his trade union base. Workers looking
for a leader capable of challenging an
established union began to flock to him.
His trade union activities have hence
had a feature of inter-union rivalries
woven into them from the very beginning.
In an extremely short time he
became a force to reckon with in the
Bombay trade union field.

Two features stood out clearly even
in this early phase. Firstly, in spite of
his militancy and workerist orientation,
Datta Samant was reluctant to participate
in broader, united struggles and
refused to take any ideological stand.
(In fact he consistently ignored the role
of the unity committee mainly led by
communists in supporting the Godrej
workers. He was to repeat this attitude
later in 1979 in ignoring the trade
unions which supported the locked-out
Premier Automobile workers. Further,
he made the very same unions targets
of attack.) Secondly, though under
attack from a Congress government he
remained a member of the Congress
party and part of its trade union structures
(so long as they did not threaten
his interests directly).

In the period of intense political activity prior to the Emergency, in
1974--75, the opposition trade unions
had forged a joint action committee.
The left parties too were working in
co-ordination. Though Samant (and his
then close collaborator, Dina Bama
Patil) continued to expand his base, he
was relatively eclipsed. The mood then
in all spheres was one of generalised
anti-State struggles. The leadership
was in the hands of the opposition
parties and their mass organisations. In
Bombay the left parties were in a prominent
position.

The period of the Emergency was
essentially one of confusion for the
working class in Bombay, like everywhere
else. Though some struggles
were launched and fought, the workers
were largely quiescent. In a situation
of stranglehold on struggles and organisations,
workers for a period did turn
to consultationist and legalist methods.
There is ample evidence to suggest a
simmering, subterranean discontent
which was beginning to become visible
towards the latter part of the Emergency.
No explosion, however, took place. In
spite of his Congress affiliations, the
pro-worker image of Samant and his
credibility as a militant did not suffer
since he was detained under the MISA
during this period.

## POST-EMERGENCY MILITANCY

The period between April 1977 and
May/June 1980 was one of electrifying
activity for workers in the Bombay region
(including the Thane-Belapur area), as
it was all over the country. The
struggles were extremely widespread.
They were militant and long drawn
out. In some units there was no 'buying
peace', as newer demands and and
newer struggles kept breaking out. The
initiative in the struggles came from
worker militants. The masses of
workers were often ahead of the trade
union leaderships. The novel features
of the struggles were particularly well
marked till mid-1979. It was a phase
of workers' democratic assertion. This
democratic assertion was manifested in
three characteristic ways:

(i) by restoration of pre-Emergency
shop-floor situation by demonstrating
workers' struggle power,
agitating for unresolved issues,
rolling back increased workload
and resisting increased supervision
interference in the work
process.

(ii) by snatching the initiative from
the trade union leadership and
sometimes restoring the decisionmaking
processes to the factorybased
worker militants.

(iii) by overthrowing established, ie,
capitalist-imposed, norms about
areas and nature of demands,
processes of resolution of disputes
as well as the basis for these
processes. Direct action was a
basic feature, as was fearless
militancy.

This was a period of generalised
political turmoil. The defeat of the
Congress had given all a sense of relief.
The victory of the Janata Party
had filled the middle classes with hope,
others with uncertainty. Industrialists
were also showing signs of uncertainty
and essential insecurity. Profits had been
high during the Emergency and were
expected to hold steady. The political
situation was, however, a cause for concern.
The routinised path was constantly
threatened and the firmness of the administrative
grip was dubious.

The confusion was reflected in the
working class. The Janata Party may
have been the political favourite; it had,
however, no working class base, no experienced
trade union leadership. The
traditional trade unions had been found
deficient in dealing with the Emergency
at the plant and company level. No leadership
and no set of activists were able
to articulate and effectively lead the
working class in its then prevalent
mood. (Most were pragmatically tailing
the spontaneous outbursts.) There was
no mechanism of self-active assertion.
There was no tradition of self-led movements.
The requisite skills were lacking.

The sections participating in this
general offensive of the working class
were also new. Concerns known for
industrial peace were also in the grip
of intense struggles. The lead in these
as well as in other units was taken by
worker-militants who had no history of
leadership, struggle participation or
militancy. They were at times earlier
strike-breakers. Generally they were
young, skilled, somewhat better educated
and with no Left political tradition.
The confusion and (mild) chaos of the
situation was compounded by this
leadership.

Datta Samant became the genuine
spearhead, representative spokesman and
natural expression of this stage, with
the working class in a militant, assertive
mood but without any cohesive apparatus
and operating in a context of political
uncertainty and instability. In his
style and methodology, he was the
representative of an interregnum.

According to estimates, Samant led
more than 50 per cent of the total of
140 strikes in the Bombay-ThaneBelapur
belt between March, 25 and
December 31, 1977. He was involved
during that year in a loss of 14.1 lakh
mandays and Rs 66.54 crore of production
(_Seminar_, June 1980). No other
leader or organisation had such a representative
spread.

Before considering Datta Samant's role
in the post-Emergency period in detail,
it is necessary to look at three factors
which helped to shape this period, from
within the trade union movement.

(a) INTUC : _Two strings to a bow._
The history, outlook, ultimate aim and
impact of the INTUC have been well
known. It has been the closely-controlled
trade union wing of the Congress,
promoting class collaboration and
ardently opposing the communists. Its
usual pro-management role has also
been well recognised. What has not
been commented upon adequately are
the characteristics, besides State support,
which give the INTUC strength
and its mass base. The 1977--1979
period also exhibited these features,
particularly when contrasted with the
Emergency period.

The INTUC seems to have been the
one organisation capable of grasping
the changing mood of the workers
almost instantaneously. Militancy, legalism,
consultationism, gains through
collaboration, absolute confrontationism
and aggressive assertion have been
exhibited by the workers in different
phases and periods. The INTUC has
been generally capable of recognising
these moods and of catering to them.
It further has been able to understand
the different moods, mentalities and behaviour
of workers in different industries
and sectors.

During the Emergency, the INTUC
concentrated on legal procedures and
negotiations. It could with great ease
press into service experts in those fields.
It expanded its base by capitalising on
the intimidated, wait-and-watch, gainsthrough-indirect-manoeuvres
mentality of
the workers. If it could not prevent
all struggles, it could prevent their
generalisation.

This stance underwent a dramatic
reversal in April 1977. The INTUC
stopped resisting the workers' militant
mood and struggles. That the Congress
was then perhaps in favour of destabilising
the economic and political balance
may also have been an important factor.
Leaders who were traditionally nonmilitant
also promoted struggles (i.e,
Raja Kulkarni, Manohar Kotwal and
KH Dastur). Those who had a somewhat
militant image were given a free
reign. Till early 1980, i.e, till he had
resigned from the Congress (I) and contested
the Parliamentary elections as an
Independent against the official candidate,
Datta Samant was part of the
INTUC, though he had violated all its
norms. His disaffiliation too was on
essentially flimsy grounds, highly technical
relating to organisational statutes,
which had long been in existence. He
'disaffiliated', not expelled; the
reason was non-payment of dues and
not his militancy or style of functioning.
What this shows is the need the
INTUC had felt for Samant's militant
image and activities. If it can be controlled
and commanded, trade union
militancy is not embarrassing for any
party which has to ultimately depend
on mass support. The Congress has
been most adept at this game and the
INTUC reflects the same thinking.

In the Thane-Belapur belt, a base of
support at the workers' residential level
has been crucial. The Congress hold in
the villages of this belt has been utilised
to the full by the INTUC. The
reign of terror that many rival trade
unionists as well as industrialists complained
of and were helpless against
was based on this non-worker support
from the surrounding villages.

The affiliation with INTUC, however
nominal it may have been, has
contributed to the Datta Samant wave.
For the INTUC, Samant was a very
useful second string to the bow. In
numerous ways, including probably
control of industrialists, he was vital in
a phase when worker militancy was
threatening to become generalised and
political power was not stabilised.

## LIMITATIONS OF RED UNIONS

(b) _The red flag unions : respectability
or offensive?_ There is hardly any
doubt about the sincerity of the contributions
made by the communist-led
unions to the workers' cause in
Bombay. Theirs has been the pioneering
work. Even as on August 4, 1980
the CITU was the number two leader
of industrial disputes in the state (19
out of 67 strikes). The communists
have been primarily responsible for
laying the foundations of workers'
organisations.

This recognition of the role of the
communists cannot, however, obscure
the fact that they have not been the
leading force in Bombay for the past
decade and more. They even lost their
stronghold among the textile workers
after 1974. The recent token strike
(October 5, 1980) of textile workers
was not the kind of success that one
expected from communist initiatives in
textiles. The left and democratic call
for a Maharashtra Bandh (full of contradictions
as it was) evoked only a
partial response in the factories on
October 15, 1980.

The AITUC generally has not recovered
from the attacks launched upon
it by the Shiv Sena. CITU has been
a steady but basically secondary force
in engineering, chemicals, woollens,
etc. The Sarva Shramik Sangh has not
been a major force after the challenges
it held out in the early seventies. The
UTUC has been on the fringes of
trade union activity in Bombay, having
at one time been important in the silk
mills. The IFTU is yet to gain any
significant foothold. The communists
have never penetrated any of the key
areas like railways, docks, transport and
power or shipping in Bombay. The
influence they have among the whitecollared
sections of banks and insurance
employees has been unable to mould
general working class struggles.

Confining our analysis to the trade
union sphere, i.e, without attempting
a general critique of the communist
movement as a whole, certain features
are quite notable. The most important
of these is the inability to change with
the times. The communist unions seemed
to be rooted in the milieu in which
they were formed. Over the years the
nature of industry and composition of
workers as well as their mentality and
aspirations have changed. The structure,
strategy and tactics of the red flag
unions have not been adequately flexible
and dynamic to relate to these changes.
These lacunae have surfaced in numerous
ways.

Over the years, it is seen, workers
pass through differing attitudes to
legalism/consultationism and militant
confrontation. A dynamic representative
of the working class, while educating
the class regarding the correct attitudes,
has to understand these as historical
and cater to these. (The INTUC, as
we have seen, opportunistically panders
to these with obviously no regard to
the educative aspects.) The communists
do not seem to have been able to deal
with these shifts, adequately. The demands
which are foremost in the
workers' minds, though not adequately
and lucidly articulated as such, also
change over time. The communist unions
have not been able to lead during such
times of change; they have often been
forced to tail behind. In the larger and
modern units for example, the arena of
battle periodically becomes the shop
floor, with areas of control as the
major issues (e.g, intensification, work
process, workers' right to be involved in
decisions regarding changes, the extent
of supervision and interference in the
work routine). There does not seem
to have been any major effort at articulating
and explaining these new
aspirations and new arenas of battle,
though the demands might have been
taken up in specific units in a concrete
manner. The inadequacy in grasping
change is seen with regard to even the
traditional demands. In 1977, for
example, the norms regarding the
quantum of wage rise underwent a
drastic change. Most unions, including
the red flag ones, were surprised at
workers' 'adamance' and ultimate management
capitulation.

The changing nature and mores of
industrial capitalism manifested in new
technology, different requirement of
skills, intensification, use of hazardous
materials and processes, financial manipulations,
sophisticated management
practices and intricate legal manoeuvres
demands a professionalisation of trade
unions. A battery of pro-worker experts
in engineering, medicine, accountancy,
law and management practices is necessary.
Barring the field of law, no effort
worth noting seems to have been made
by particularly the communist-led trade
unions.

The structure of these unions also
leads to a certain slowness of response.
The leadership is essentially external to
plant/shop floor level activities. It is
hence not immediately aware of or
receptive to the changes. The channels
of communication are rigidly formaliser
creating a distance between the
leadership and the rank and file.

An ironic situation perhaps is that the
the red flag unions are considered by
managements to be responsible', i.e,
they accept the norms of capitalism in
practice if not in theory. They are
overall defensive organisations geared
to the backward sectors of industry.

The limitations of the red flag trade
unions created a vacuum of leadership
and representation among the Bombay
working class. The Datta Samant wave
could only be conceivable in such a
vacuum.

## UNION RIVALRY IN NEW FORM

(c) _Inter-union rivalry:_ Multiplicity
of trade unions and rivalry among
them has now become a standard
feature of the trade union scene.
Though in the 1977--80 period interunion
rivalry acquired a bloody intensity
and became a topic of common
discussion, it is by no means a new or
recent phenomenon. The causes of
the multiplicity and rivalry have been
usually external to the trade union
field. The differences have been political,
critical primarily within the
leaderships and only secondarily carried
and conveyed to the workers.

The new feature of inter-union
rivalries in the recent period is that
this political factor is subsidiary, almost
casual and incidental. The rivalries
have been located at the plant level
and are basically fuelled by issues and
occurrences at the plant level. This is
not to say that empire building aspirations,
of Datta Samant particularly,
have not been instrumental. They have
been. Even non-genuine rivalries
have been provoked. Some of these,
however, have been centred among
workers in the factory.

A lot has been written by commentators
of different ideological shades
on inter-union rivalries. A number of
them have paid disproportionate attention
to the aspect of terror and violence.
It is necessary to state firmly that no
mafia rules the Bombay trade union
scene, and that terror too has social
historical contexts and has is limits. (It is
instructive to remember that even in
the Dhanbad situation, workers have
thrown up a challenge to gangsterism
under the leadership of A K Roy.)

An established union faces a challenge
from a new one in many situations.
Some of these are contrived by managements,
governments, political rivals,
etc. At times, however, the basis of
this challenge is in the workers themselves.
The root cause is almost always
the alienation of the union from the
mass of the workers. A long period
of absence of struggle, formal recognition
by management and a consultationist/legalistic
approach tend to stabilise
and institutionalise a union. It
then, at a particular plant level, ceases
to be the expression of the workers'
movement. Managements too, through
the norms of recognition, impose on
the union the character of mediator
between capital and labour. Such a
union sooner or later becomes a target
of suspicion and discontent.

The union structures often rely too
much on a factory committee which
may not be elected for years. The
workers then find the committee members
as insurmountable blocks in the
way of their communication with the
union. No avenue of expressing their
discontent against these committees is
readily available. The only way at times
left to change the committee is to
overthrow the union itself.

The consumerist attitude that workers
have towards unions is also
responsible for union changeovers.
The causes of this consumerist attitude
are, however, to be found in the
essential bureaucratisation of the unions
and the non-realisation of ideological
differences between the unions at the
shop floor level.

A changeover in unions may be seen
as the curbing of bureaucratic power
of any one union. It is also a method
of keeping union leaderships alert and
sensitive to the demands, moods and
aspirations of the workers.

Rarely is a union overthrown unaided
by factory based militants. A
rival leadership is sought and brought
into picture, often not for its own
sake but only to facilitate the overthrow.
This is a consequence of the
non-existence of a tradition of selfactivity
and self-organisation among
workers.

Excessive hopes or the desire to be
'truly represented' causes at times
changeovers when a 'wave' is sweeping
the area. In these cases it may not be
possible to locate any genuine factory
level causes justifying the inter-union
rivalry.

It must lastly be mentioned that
terror too plays a definite part. It
creates or adds to an atmosphere of
power and invincibility. Those who
cannot face up to the terror and go on
the defensive for whatever reasons are
usually the losers. A retreatist attitude
results in the loss of support of the
non-staunch followers.

In Bombay inter-union rivalries in
the post-emergency period have exhibited
all these characteristics. Samant
took them to a new pitch. He seems
to have also harboured some ambitions
of building a trade union empire. The
general turmoil enabled him to attempt
a virtual trade union war, which
openly acquired a decadent and
megalomaniac character in 1980.

The declaration of elections in
January 1977 along with the consequent
relaxation of the political atmosphere
electrified the workers. They
began to resort to various actions.
After the elections the acticns rose to
fever pitch. With these actions, which
were largely spontaneous, began the
Datta Samant wave. The leaderships
accepted during the Emergency were
cast away and Samant was sought.
His militant leadership had not been
forgotten. He was called upon to lead
once again.

This was also the period in which,
at first, no organisation seemed to be
in the lead. All unions were involved
in work stoppages. Soon however
Samant began to emerge as the most
important leader. His entry into the
conflicts was marked by long drawn
out struggles, militantly carried out.
The formation of a union under
Samant's leadership in a factory
heralded a strike or lockout.

## UNCOMPROMISING CONFRONTATION

The attraction that Samant held
for workers can now be fairly clearly
understood. He represented direct,
swift and uncompromising confrontation.
His charter of demands in most
places was simple, in practice if not
on paper. He would usually put forth
a direct, simple, lump sum demand,
e.g, a wage rise of Rs 200 pm per
worker. He did not seem to be unduly
bothered by the intricacies of the
modalities by which this was to be
effected. Palpable, attractive quantums
were the backbone of his demands. The
quantums of wage rise demanded were
also unpresedentedly high. Some observers
ascribe to Samant the change in
norms in this regard, which was dramatic.
A closer examination reveals that this
was not a specific Samant feature but
a general characteristic. The workers
themselves were responsible for insistently
demanding these quantums and
for refusing to compromise. It would
perhaps be more correct to say that
the general price of labour power was
being in this period revised. Samant
was instrumental above all in dramatically
bringing into focus this revised
wage norm.

Samant also effectively articulated
the general distrust of capitalists which
the workers were feeling. He echoed
the disgust which the worker was
feeling towards the legal system. The
labour law machinery had been seen
to be time-consuming, murderously
slow and essentially biased against the
workers. It was not seen in any way
as an aid to problem solving. An activist
of Samant's union has been quoted
as saying (_Sunday_, September 7; 1980):
"We don't need more labour courts.
They are traps for workers. Let them
burn down the existing ones also."
This has also by and large been the
feeling of the average worker. Samant
supported it, verbalised it and acted
upon it. He generally kept away from
the legal machinery and legal procedures.
Direct talks, direct actions and
appeals to ministerial authority to
intervene have marked his operations.
He has not only avoided legal procedures,
but has violated accepted legalistic
norms. He brushed aside injunctions,
ignored questions of the legality
of his actions, trampled upon signed
and concluded agreements. He seemed
to have realised at a practical level
that the real balance of power resides
in and is achieved at the production
points. Laws can be bypassed with
impunity if strength can be mustered
on the shop floor and at factory gates.

The distrust which he displayed in
the financial statements of companies
also echoed the workers' sentiments. He
refused to accept these as the basis of any
settlements, refused to even read them.
He has repeatedly and openly called
them fraudulent. The only basis for negotiations
that he has accepted are his
own demands. Intricate arguments
about capacity to pay, etc, he has
treated as useless lies. He displayed in
the same manner a contempt for negotiations.
Not much, he seems to have
felt, can be achieved through negotiations.
They are only ways of delaying
the proceedings and of trapping the
workers, Trial of strength through
immediate direct confrontation was the
foundation of his methodology.

Datta Samant seems to the managements
outrageous, He has been
variously alluded to as irresponsible,
a maverick, a mafia-style operator,
and so on. What has been characteristically
missed is that the 'outrageous
and irresponsible' behaviour is the
basis of his strength. In an atmosphere
of total distrust of and disgust with
capitalist norms and modes, variously
imposed on the legal and trade union
machinery, a flouting of bourgeois
respectability and responsibility held
great attraction for the workers. The
post-1977 period was one of challenging
and overthrowing the state and
management-imposed codes of conduct.
It was a period of the working
class shaking up their own organisations
and casting them aside. The
representative of such a mood and
period could only be one who trampled
upon every value, every rule, every
norm held sacred by the establishment.
A class difference had to be asserted,
non-cumpromising confrontation had to
be declared. The working class had to
become, and to experience becoming, ,
unencumbered of fetters acquired in a
different period. The Emergency had
tellingly brought this awareness. Samant
rose to play this historic role, however
inadequately, however distortedly. His
outrageous irresponsibility was a reflection
of the aspirations and feelings
of the workers themselves. That is
why he was appreciated and followed
by the workers and not ridiculed.

## SPEARHEAD OF AN UPSURGE

Datta Samant in many respects is
not a trade unionist. He is only the
spearhead and figurehead of an upsurge.
He does not organise workers, he
mobilises them. He does not pay much
attention to normal day-to-day trade
union activities. He only leads the
workers into strikes or lockouts. He
has no systematised organisational
structure. He has no norms. He pays
no attention to the consolidation of
experiences gained by the workers. He
seems to be constantly heading a
charge. His is not an organisational
effort, it is not even a movement. He
is leading what is essentially a struggle
campaign, launched and desired by the
workers themselves. In a particular
period he was therefore the expression
of an upsurge which changed the set
norms. In another, with his many
limitations, he may become a liability
to workers' struggles.

One characteristic which stands out,
particularly in the earlier part of this
period, is Samant's capacity to inspire
confidence in workers, to galvanise even
the docile ones into militant actions.
Workers in some units --- particularly
the smaller or far flung ones --- have
not even met Samant in person. Under
his leadership they have struggled. He
organised no relief for workers in long
drawn out work stoppages, but they
did not revolt. This 'charismatic' hold
is nothing short of fascinating. Rarely
have there been any democratic procedures
about decision making. A small
coterie usually takes all the decisions.
Not even otherwise alert observers
have termed this bureaucratisation.

Datta Samant's operations are marked
by certain other features. His organisations
seem to be very loose structurally.
The conduct of day-to-day
affairs at a factory is left to a local
committee --- self-appointed rather
than elected in many cases. These
committees of 'worker militants' are a
peculiar mixture. In some factories
(e g, Premier Automobiles, Larsen and
Toubro) they comprise authentic activists
with militant pasts enjoying the
trust and respect of the workers and
having basic working class positions in
their outlook. In many others such
genuine militants are either in a minority
or even absent. Toughies (who
were in some cases once strikebreakers)
evoking fear rather than
respect and with basically opportunist
tendencies dominate the scene.

The Samant wave is also marked by
a strong personality cult. The approach
of Samant to the workers is
that of a saviour. The workers too by
and large look upon him as that. Not
the strength and struggles of the
workers but the magical qualities of
Samant are seen to be responsible for
various occurrences. Slogans and
speeches (of his lieutenants) extol this
messianic leadership. Having become
a cult figure he has shown tremendous
sympathy but hardly any respect for
the workers he leads. His functioning
has primitivist plebiscitary elements
but no participative democratic character.
He therefore approximates a
populist autocratism rather than a
democratic representative leadership.

A major issue of the Samant wave
has been violent inter-union rivalry.
The wave has killed, injured and
inflicted tremendous harm upon
numerous activists of other unions. It
may seem to some, with definite justification,
that the main enemy and
target of the Samant wave were other
unions and not managements. The
character of these inter-union rivalries
has also changed over the past three
years, though their existence has been
a constant feature. The clashes in
Godrej (1972) and Crompton and
Greaves (1980) provide the extremities
not only chronologically but also in
methods and spirit. Samant at one
time did provoke the workers to
revolt against non-militant, pro-management
unions. He also supported
counter-violence against elements which
terrorised the workers into accepting
meekly particular organisations and
leaderships, The counter-offensives
were then of a mass character as the
issues were genuine. Samant in 1977
became the main instrument to challenge
stifling, unpopular, non-representative
leaderships. As his popularity
and following widened, this character
of his challenge changed. The issues
became non-genuine, the violence became
murderous, sneak, conspiratorial
and criminal; terrorism became an important
element; the activist base became
one of toughs and bullies; the
credibility, genuineness or mass following
of target unions became immaterial.
From a workers' revolt
against oppressive fostered organisation,
the rivalries became degenerate,
unscrupulous attacks on genuine militants.
Terror too began to be used
not as a protective counter but as an
intimidatory professionalised weapon of
reprisal and bullying to overawe a
mass into submission. The combatants
were no longer worker militants, but
sneak attackers who remained unidentified.
Support of a significant section
was once precondition, militant
antecedents of main supporters were
necessary. Over time all these criteria
were thrown to the winds. Threats to
any and all unions have become a
norm.

Before attempting to evaluate Datta
Samant's impact, one more feature has
to be noted. Samant has resisted all
efforts to bring him into any united
co-ordinated platforms. The Sarva
Shramik Sangh (in spite of having
been his target in Mukand) tried repeatedly.
During the Premier Automobiles
struggle of 1979 the SSS and
Kamani Employees' Union actively
mobilised support. Samant frustrated
all these efforts The Congress (U)
and the Janata Party were the only
organisations invited to address his
long march gatherings.

## BASICALLY NEGATIVE IMPACT

Having noted his representative
militancy and popularity, it is necessary
to note the basically negative impact
the Samant wave has left on
Bombay workers. This has not been
accidental, but is linked to the method
and style of Samant's operation.

(1) Workers were led into strikes or
lockouts which were tremendously long
drawn out, Once a work stoppage
occurred, Samant seemed to have no
further plan of action. In the war of
attrition which resulted the managements
could generally out-wait the
workers. The workers were forced
into a situation of passive waiting
while their powers and capacities
became slowly eroded. While in many
cases the monetary demands may have
ultimately been won, the morale of the
rank and file is sapped. The length
of the work stoppage does not by
itself indicate militancy or working
class elan. The approach to the stoppage
and actions during it are of far
greater importance. In the struggles
led by Samant, with a few exceptions,
once a work stoppage occurred, initiative
passed into the hands of the managements
and workers became passive
victims. No negotiations could be
forced upon the management, no other
forms of struggles or organisations
could be devised. Ultimately in such
situations, mediators, mainly ministers,
would be asked to intervene and an
'award' would be obtained from a
position of dissipated strength ---
settlement that upon scrutiny would
not justify the duration of the stoppage,
in material, organisational cr
political terms.

The overall effect of this style has
been to tire out the workers in long
drawn out, bitter, unimaginatively-led
struggles. Their anger and initiative
have been prevented, through this militant
deviation, from becoming generalised
and crystallised.

(2) When the struggles and their
terminations are examined the above
described aspect acquires newer dimensions.
In many cases while demonstrative
(and much talked about) monetary
gains were made, numerous
important points were conceded.
Managements refused to recognise the
unions led by Samant which had led
the struggles in the recently concluded
agreements, e.g, Premier Automobiles,
Calico Chemicals, etc. Sainant was
reduced to the position of a helpless
bystander. Who should be the representatives
of workers was determined
not by workers' confidence and wish
but by managements' will. Not even
_de facto_ recognition was won. Further,
activists were victimised, under one
garb or the other. The most recent
agreements have canonised the principle
of suspension of activists against
whom there are police cases.

Non-achievement of demands, particularly
the monetary ones, is not a
major criterion. Struggles have to be
withdrawn many times. Even withdrawn,
defeated struggles are important
and necessary learning experiences.
They can help to focus issues, strengthen
the organisation, advance political
education. What is important is how
the struggle is fought and withdrawn.
In the many struggles conducted and
concluded by Samant, the rank and
file workers neither seem to have been
taken into confidence nor made participants
in decisions. Reversals are not
in the long term perceived by workers
as victories just because the leaders so
paint them. This deceit in fact demoralises
workers.

It will not be surprising at all if the
long term effect of the Samant wave is
uncertainty, demoralisation and fatigue.

(3) The nature of demands championed
by Samant also needs to be
commented upon. The demands have
all been simplistic and monetary. The
aspect of conflict over prerogatives and
control, which was marked in the
early stages of the 1977-1980 struggle
phase in Bombay, has been totally
bypassed or ignored by the Samant
wave.

The monetary demands too have
been achieved by conceding points of
great importance. Production and
productivity increases have been
accepted (Mukand, Preinier). Activists
have been allowed to be victimised.
Managements have been allowed to
divise new work norms (Gannon Dunkerley).
In some cases extended period
agreements have been signed. In one
case even retrenchment of workers, has
been accepted.

(4) Inter-union rivalries have been
commented upon earlier. Apart from
other things, some cases exhibit assaults
on original unions, uncalled for on any
count except personal ambition. Greaves
and Crompton is only the most
dramatic example of this. There are
many others. Attack a union, overthrow
it, challenge the existing agreement,
enter into a long struggle, sign a new
agreement only slightly better, essentially
the same or even worse than the
previous one. In Gannon Dunkerley
after a union change and a 225-day
strike not only was the same agreement
re-signed but management engineers
were allowed to determine production
norms. In another unit the CITU, after
leading a struggle, had got Rs 90 pm
raise for 900 workers. Samant's leadership,
after a further struggle, got Rs 35
more per worker per month upon promising
25 per cent increase in production
and accepting retrenchment of
workers.

The targets of the Samant wave,
therefore, have been termed by some
as other unions and not managements.
Confidence in militancy and efficiency
of struggles is in a devious and subtle
manner destroyed by these tactics.

## AVERSE TO UNITY

(5) It has been said earlier that
Samant was unfavourable to any unity/
co-ordination efforts with other unions.
Even localised, area-wise, issue-based
unity was not entered into. Not only
that, issues were not generalised and
focused even on the basis of his own
unions. In these three years his worker
followers have come together in joint
demonstrations very few times (only
four can be recalled off-hand). Twice
it was to protest against court/police
actions against Samant (as a person),
and twice in recent months on general
issues. No solidarity actions, no residential
area mobilisation, no extension
of struggle issues has been attempted.
The working class has been maintained
in a fragmented state, the fragmentation
perpetuated through acts of commission
and omission.

(6) The organisational structure of
Samant's unions has also been peculiar.
The current phase of activity of the
workers has exhibited an inadequacy in
the established trade unions' organisational
structures. This inadequacy was
assuming crisis proportions and becoming
a drag on the workers' advance. A
rigid formalisation with acceptance of
official norms and channels, an insensitivity
to shop floor attitudes and aspirations and lack of professional competence
(regarding non-monetary issues)
were the main lacunae. Samant's organisations
have bypassed these issues.
His unions with their loose structure,
ideological non-definition and direct
action tactics recreated an earlier organisational
form. He revived what were
in essence strike committees. The current
stage of capitalism, however, renders
these grossly inadequate and incompetent.
These committees of Samant
are also, moreover, largely undemocratic
and hence in spirit bureaucratic
and vulnerable to corruption, co-optation
and distortion.

One can agree with the commentator
who says that Samant's activities were
a response to the crisis in trade unions.
One can also agree that Samant is in
rapport with the prevalent consciousness
of the workers, trade union and
political (_Business Standard_, September
15, 1980). It will be necessary, however,
to add to these comments. The
Samant wave was a primitivist response
to the crisis. It did not go beyond the
crisis and resolve it. It attempted to
revive and recreate a structure and
method suited to an earlier phase. It
represented not an advancement but a
throwback. That is why its novelty
could confound the managements and
the government for a short time. They
were soon able to deal with it, to dissipate
it. The Samant wave not only
reflected the prevalent consciousness, it
also chained the workers to it. That
level of consciousness was glorified,
fossilised and channels of its heightening
were blocked. Generalisation, consolidation
and intensification of action,
experience and consciousness was prevented.
An upsurge with a political,
class based potential was dissipated into
factory level agitations on monetary
demands and thereby disarmed. The
bourgeoisie digested one more episode
of working class challenge with no
more discomfort than a tummy ache
and Samant served as a bitter but useful enzyme.
