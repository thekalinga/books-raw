# Introductory

Time was when even eminent gandhians like Dr. J. C. Kumarappa
and Pandit Sunderlal did not escape from being denounced
as 'communist fellow-travellers' for merely telling the truth about
the Soviet Union and China, of the remarkable progress that
these countries have made in bettering human relations and
providing a decent living standard to their peoples. Genuine
Gandhians that they are, they could not help speaking out that
what was happening in these countries was '_Gandhism_ in action'.

Those were days when the then Madras chief minister, Shri
C. Rajagopalachari, had declared war on the communists, whom
he described as his 'enemy number one'. Those were days when
the then railway minister banned the sale of Soviet books and
magazines at railway bookstalls as 'tendentious' literature while,
at the same time, permitting the free circulation of all the decadent
and pornographic stuff imported from the 'free world'.
Those were days when the then commerce minister stood up on
the floor of the Parliament and opposed the resolution moved by
communist MP Sundarayya, advocating trade agreements with
the Soviet Union.

Much water has since flown down the Ganga as well as the
Volga. In less than a year after the commerce minister's opposition
to the communist resolution on Indo-Soviet trade relations,
the Indo-Soviet agreement was signed. Innumerable delegations
from the two countries have visited each other --- cultural delegations,
delegations of technicians of various types, of parliamentary
and political leaders, delegations of representatives of
mass organisations, etc. The very Rajagopalachari who declared
the communists to be his 'enemy number one' has made some
of the most forthright statements praising the Soviet Union's
role in the struggle for peace and its attitude towards the banning
of atomic and hydrogen weapons. Above all, the unprecedentedly
warm and enthusiastic welcome accorded to our prime
minister in the Soviet Union, followed by a similar welcome
accorded to the Soviet leaders in our country, has made the air
reverberate with the inspiring slogan, 'Hindi-Russi Bhai-Bhai'.

These friendly relations between the two countries have
become possible because the leaders of both have accepted
'peaceful coexistence of states following different social systems'
as the basis of international relations. As Sriman Narayan,
general secretary of the _Congress_, wrote:

> We have not the slightest intention of interfering with the ideologies
of other countries, nor can we afford to allow any other
country to interfere with our way of life (_AICC Economic Review_,
1 December 1955).

Both the Indian and Soviet leaders have, at the same time,
pointed out that the social and state systems existing in the two
countries, and the philosophical outlook guiding their governmental
leaders, are different from each other. Bulganin and
Khrushchoy combined their warm call for mutual cooperation
between the governments and peoples of the two countries in
the cause of peace with a spirited defence of the philosophy and
practice of Marxism. The leaders of the ruling party in our
country, in their turn, have also made it clear that they stick to
the philosophy and practice of what is generally referred to as
_Gandhism_. One of them, Sriman Narayan, declared unequivocally:

>It must always be remembered that the means or methods employed
for the achievement of these objectives (world peace and
cooperation on the basis of the Five Principles and improvement of
the economic lot of the common man by eliminating exploitation and
bringing about economic justice) are fundamentally different in India
and in the Soviet Union. ... _There can be no compromise between
the ideologies of Lenin and Gandhi_ (_Ibid._, emphasis added).

This makes it clear that while enormous possibilities have
opened out for mutual cooperation between India and the Soviet
Union in the field of foreign relations --- beneficial to the peoples
of both countries, as well as to the cause of peace in the world
--- the internal struggle between the ruling party in our country
(which claims to base itself on the teachings of _Gandhism_) and
those parties of the democratic opposition (which claim to base
themselves on Marxism-Leninism) will continue unabated.
Peaceful coexistence between _states_ and cooperation between
them for purposes of solving _international problems does not
resolve conflicts between different classes inside our country_
which find expression in different ideologies. For example,
the unity of the Indian people that was magnificently shown in
the warm welcome given to the Soviet leaders has not resolved
such questions of internal policy as :

1) Can the land problem in our country be solved through
   the _Bhoodan movement_, or does it require the development of
   an organised peasant movement strong enough to smash the
   power of the landlords and other reactionary classes?
2) Can the programme of rapid industrialisation (to which
   the whole country is now committed) be brought about on the
   basis of compromise with, or determined struggles against,
   foreign monopoly capital?
3) Is the objective of rapid industrialisation itself a correct
   objective, or, does it come into conflict with the _Sarvodaya_ ideal
   to which the leaders of the ruling party seem to be committed?

Differences and conflicts continue on these issues not only
between _Gandhism_ and Marxism-Leninism, but even between
various trends claiming to base themselves on _Gandhism_.

It has become necessary under these circumstances that
Marxist-Leninists try to make a correct appraisal of the philosophy
and practice of _Gandhism_. Such an examination has been
facilitated by the appearance of the eight-volume biography
_Mahatma_, by D. G. Tendulkar. In this the author claims to
have tried 'to tell the story faithfully and, as far as possible,
in the words of Gandhiji himself, who not only took the leading
part in the movement but wrote the best commentary on it' (I, pp. xvii--xviii).
After collecting material on his life, the author had it
checked by Gandhiji himself.

>When I met him last on 22 January 1948, we discussed the
smallest details --- the format of the biography, type, illustrations,
standardization of spelling, quotation marks and even hyphens. He
took great interest in my work and always gave me his gracious
cooperation (I, pp. xviii--xix).

The author also acknowledges the help and cooperation
which he received from numerous followers and disciples of the
Mahatma, including Mahadev Desai, R. R. Diwakar and K. G.
Mashruwala. Above all, the book carries a highly appreciative
foreword by the prime minister who considers 'this book to be
of great value as a record, not only of the life of a man supreme
in his generation, but also of a period of India's history which
has intrinsic importance of its own' (I, p. xiv).
