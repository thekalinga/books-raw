# '_Quit India_' And After

The narration of events in the last chapter makes it clear
that the question at issue between the _Congress working committee_
and Gandhiji was, by no means, the ethics or otherwise
of the use of violence in national defence, but one of how to
negotiate with, and put pressure on, the British.

Gandhiji's advocacy of _non-violence_ pure and simple, his
determination to fight the war efforts in a 'non-violent' way, proved
effective as a form of pressure against the British. The _working
committee_, therefore, always put itself under his leadership
whenever there was necessity for giving a threat of struggle or
for organising a struggle.

On the other hand, whenever there was an opportunity for
negotiations with the British, the _working committee_ took a 'realistic
position' that negotiations could be conducted only on the
basis of offering India's cooperation with the British if power is
transferred. On all such occasions, Gandhiji himself asked that
he should be relieved of leadership and to which the _working
committee_ readily agreed. This evidently was an admirable
arrangement which perfectly suited the basic strategy of the _bourgeoisie_
: negotiations with the British, supported with mass
pressure.

The biggest example of the conflict and agreement between
Gandhiji and the rest of the _Congress_ leadership was the manner
in which subsequent negotiations were conducted between the
_Congress_ and the representatives of the British.

It was for the specific purpose of enabling the _Congress
working committee_ to carry on negotiations that Gandhiji gave
up his leadership of the _Congress_ towards the end of 1941 and
in the beginning of 1942. While the negotiations were formally
conducted by the _Congress_ president and the _working committee_,
Gandhiji's advice was nevertheless sought at every stage.
While Gandhiji himself kept formally out of the negotiations,
his was the voice which was decisive in shaping the policy of
the _Congress_ negotiators. Furthermore, the moment the negotiations
broke down, the moment it was clear that the British
were not prepared to grant the minimum that was demanded of
them by the _Congress_, Gandhiji once again came to the forefront
as the leader of the anti-war anti-British mass movement. It
was he who coined the well-known slogan: '_Quit India_'.

One cannot but be struck by the difference between Gandhiji's
attitude to the British in 1940--41 and his attitude in 1942.
The struggle which was launched in 1940--41 under his leadership,
Gandhiji made it clear, was not a struggle for independence.
He asked:

>How are we to fight for independence with those whose own
independence is in grave peril? Even if independence can be given
by one nation to another, it is not possible for the English. Those
who are themselves in peril cannot save others. But, if they fight
unto death for their freedom and they are at all reasonable, they
must recognise our right of free speech (V, p. 48).

In 1942, however, he was of a different opinion. He said:

>My firm opinion is that the British should leave now in an
orderly manner and not run the risk that they did in Singapore,
Malaya, and Burma. The act would mean courage of a high order,
confession of human limitations and right doing by India (VI, p. 92).

To this contrast in the objectives --- between 'freedom of
speech and nothing more' and 'independence here and now'
--- we may well note the contrast in the methods of struggle. In
1940--41, Gandhiji restricted the struggle to a few _satyagrahis_
selected by him on the basis of certain severe tests laid down by
him. He frowned on all those who made suggestions that the
_satyagraha_ should not be restricted to a few selected individuals,
but should be made a mass struggle. 'It did not matter' he said,
'how few the _satyagrahis_ might be; if they were only 10 or 12,
they would represent the whole of the _Congress_'. 'Does not one
ambassador represent his people?' asked Gandhiji.

His attitude in 1942 was entirely different. For the first
time in his life, he did not denounce the masses of the people
for having resorted to violence. Departing from his traditional
outlook on militant mass actions (as at the time of _Chauri
Chaura_, etc.), he now took the stand that whatever 'mob violence'
took place was the natural reaction to the 'leonine
violence' resorted to by the government.

There are also indications that, in the days before 8 August
1942, Gandhiji had visualised that a spontaneous rising of the
people would take place when the '_Quit India_' struggle was
launched. For once in his life, he talked of a mass struggle in
which the millions of peasants would rise in revolt not only
against the British government but also against landlords. For
example, he told the American journalist, Mr. Louis Fischer, that
the peasants would begin with non-payment of taxes but that
'refusal to pay it will give the peasants courage to think that
they are capable of independent action. Their next step will
be to seize the land'.

>'With violence?' Mr. Fischer asked.
>
>'There may be violence', Gandhi replied, but then again, landlords
>may cooperate'.
>
>'You are an optimist', Mr. Fischer remarked.
>
>'They might cooperate by fleeing', Gandhi said.
>
>'Or, Mr. Fischer said, 'they might organise violent resistance'.
> 
>'There may be fifteen days of chaos', Gandhi said, 'but I think
>we would soon bring that under control' (VI, p. 122).

It would, however, be wrong from this to conclude that
Gandhiji had visualised a real revolutionary struggle of the
people. For, though he talked of 'peasants seizing land', 'fifteen
days of chaos', etc., the days in which he was popularising the
idea of a struggle to enforce the demand for British withdrawal,
he did not make any serious preparations to launch and lead
revolutionary actions of the organised working class and the
peasantry.

It is significant in this connection that Gandhiji's two-hour
speech at the AICC session contained not a word addressed to
the workers or the peasants : A major part of the speech was
devoted to an exposition of his and the _Congress_' attitude to the
Hindu-Muslim question; then a few words on the need for great
sacrifice in carrying on the struggle. (his slogan 'Do or Die');
following this, special appeals to the journalists, to the princes,
to the government servants, to the soldiers and to the students,
telling each section as to what they could and should do in
support of the '_Quit India_' struggle. The overwhelming majority
of the people, i.e., the workers and peasants, did not come into
Gandhiji's picture at all. They had no special role to play
--- except as a silent mob ready to sacrifice, to 'Do or Die'.

That this omission was by no means casual will be clear
from the 'draft of instructions' which Gandhiji had prepared for
the _working committee_. The draft calls for a day for _hartal_
(similar to the one with which he inaugurated the _non-cooperation_
movement over two decades ago). But he laid down that,
'On the day of the _hartal_, no processions should be taken out,
nor meetings held in the cities, all people should observe a
twenty-four hours' fast and offer prayers'. No doubt he allowed
meetings and processions in villages 'where there is no fear of
violence or disturbance'. It was thus clear that, in this struggle
as in the earlier ones, one of Gandhiji's chief objectives was to
prevent militant demonstrations and actions by the mass of the
toiling people.

It is also significant that his draft of instructions took
abundant precautions against possible outbreak of any anti-landlord
action of the peasantry. Going back on the Louis
Fischer interview, he asked the peasants to restrict themselves,
to struggle against the government alone :

>Where the _zamindari_ system prevails, the _zamindars_ pay the
tax to the government and the ryot to the _zamindar_. In such cases,
if the _zamindar_ makes common cause with the ryot, his portion of
the revenue, which may be settled by mutual agreement, should be
given to him. But if a _zamindar_ wants to side with the government,
no tax should be paid to him (VI, p. 215).

There is, therefore, no cause for the assumption, still made
by several political groups and individuals, that the 'August
Revolution' had been planned by Gandhiji as a really revolutionary
mass struggle. It is undoubtedly true that this was the
struggle in which Gandhiji was far less anxious than any time
before to prevent militant mass actions of the people. He had
visualised and had actually desired, that the launching of struggle
would unleash a lot of mass energy, initiative and militancy.
He did not mind very much if these mass actions departed from
those strict rules of _ahimsa_ which he had insisted upon in earlier
struggles. But does it mean that he wanted this struggle to be
directed on an uncompromisingly militant mass action, which
would end the total defeat of the imperialists and their Indian
agents?

Facts unmistakably show that Gandhiji had no such ideas.
The very fact that he visualised the struggle would end in a few
days, that it would be a 'short and swift' struggle, shows that
he hoped that the spontaneous actions of the people would force
the government to seek for terms. He was obviously hoping
that if there was chaos in the country even for a few days, for
example, the mass of the people spontaneously expressed their
anger and resorted to such militant actions as did paralyse the
governmental machinery --- if, again, the government servants and
soldiers responded to his call 'to obey only those orders of the
government that are just', then a situation would be created in
which the leaders of the _Allied Powers_ would put still greater
pressure on the British and force them to concede the Indian
demand.

It should be noted in this connection that a major part of
Gandhiji's speeches and writings during the pre-August weeks
was addressed to the _Allied Powers_ and their leaders. Through
a series of interviews with foreign correspondents, through
personal letters addressed to Marshal Chiang Kai-shek and
President Roosevelt, through repeated references to the necessity
for 'defending Russia and China', through a special appeal 'to
the foreign press and through them to the world' and lastly in
his speech at the AICC meeting itself --- through all this Gandhiji
made it clear that he expected the _Allied Powers_ to intercede
with Britain on India's behalf. Maulana Azad too, in his speech
winding up the proceedings of the AICC, 'stated that he was
addressing the United Nations on the _Congress_ demand and
would strive till the last minute to reach a settlement'.

A few weeks after the Bombay AICC meeting showed that
this calculation was wrong. Neither was the mass upsurge strong
enough to paralyse the governmental machinery nor were the
leaders of the _Allied Powers_ willing to put sufficient pressure on
the British government to concede the Indian demand. 'By the
end of September', says Tendulkar, 'the government had apparently
succeeded in crushing both the non-violent and the violent
attempts to compel them to _Quit India_'.

Just as in 1932, so too now, Gandhiji undertook a fast inside
jail. Both the 1932 as well as the 1943 fasts were undertaken
ostensibly on a non-political, moral issue. But, in the case of
both, these non-political moral issues were used as the starting
point of a political action --- launching of negotiations with the
British on political issues.

We have seen in an earlier chapter how the ostensibly social
question of the place of _Harijans_ in Hindu society was taken
up by Gandhiji in 1932 for a fast inside jail --- with a view to
having the British Prime Minister's _Communal Award_ modified
--- which itself was to have been, in its turn, used for negotiations
on the constitutional issue. So too in 1942--43, Gandhiji took
up allegations made by the government in justification of its
repressive policies following the August meeting of the AICC,
and made it an ostensibly moral issue. However, this was by
no means a moral issue, but a political one, as can be seen from
the following summary of his stand which he gave in a letter to
the Viceroy, dated January. 1943:

>To sum up: (1) If you want me to act singly, convince me that
I was wrong and I will make ample amends. (2) If you want me
to make a proposal on behalf of the _Congress_, you should put me
among the _working committee_ members. I plead that you make up
your mind to end the impasse (VI, pp. 234--35).

The government, however, was not prepared to accept
Gandhiji's suggestions. This provoked him to go on a fast, which
particularly at his age, raised alarm and panic throughout the
country. To this sense of general anxiety for his life, the government
had to respond; it allowed several visitors to see him
during the fast. This was the beginning of a campaign for the
release of the _Congress_ leaders and for the opening of negotiations
between the _Congress_ and the government.

Gandhiji made it clear to his visitors that he would do his
best to solve the political impasse which followed the _Quit India_
movement and the subsequent arrest of _Congress_ leaders. The
_non-Congress_ leaders, who met in Bombay in March, issued a
statement, in which they said :

>The recent talks which some of us have had with Gandhiji lead
us to believe that a move for reconciliation at the present juncture
will bear fruit. It is our conviction that, if Gandhiji is set at liberty,
he will do his best to give guidance and assistance in the solution
of internal deadlock and that there need be no fear that there would
be any danger for the successful prosecution of war (VI, p.250).

Just as on the question of negotiations between the government
and the _Congress_, so on the question of negotiations
between the _Congress_ and _Muslim League_, Gandhiji had
changed from the stand which he had taken during the days of
the _Quit India_ movement. This was made clear by Rajagopalachari
more than a year later :

>On 10 July 1944, Rajagopalachari published the formula which
had been discussed with and had been approved by Gandhi during
his fast in 1943. The formula was intended to serve as a basis for a
settlement between the _Congress_ and the _Muslim League_. (VI, p. 332).

Gandhiji also made attempts to establish direct contact with
Jinnah. Referring to Jinnah's complaint as to 'Why does he
(Gandhi) not write to me direct?' Gandhiji wrote in the beginning
of May :

>I welcome your invitation. I suggest our meeting face to face
rather than our talking through correspondence. ... Why should not
you and I approach the great question of communal unity as men
determined on finding a common solution and work together to make
our solution acceptable to all who are concerned with it or are interested
in it? (VI, pp. 259--60).

The government, however, refused to respond either on the
question of negotiations between the government and the _Congress_
or on the question of facilitating negotiations between the
_Congress_ and the _Muslim League_. In their replies to Gandhiji's
letters preceding his fast, they took the stand that Gandhiji
should dissociate himself from the August resolution of the AICC
and condemn the acts of violence on the part of the people and
of several _Congress_ leaders. The request of the _non-Congress_
leaders for permission to see Gandhiji was turned down by the
government on the following ground :

>So long as the _Congress_ policy remains what it is, there can be
no question of any alteration in our attitude towards the _Congress_.
... With every respect for your good intentions and your anxiety to
see a happy solution, I cannot agree to give special facilities such as
you ask for contact with Mr. Gandhi and other leaders, while conditions
remain as I have described them (VI, pp. 251--52).

As for Gandhiji's letter to Jinnah, the government simply
refused to forward it to him on the ground that

>they (government) are not prepared to give facilities for political
correspondence or contact to a person detained for promoting an
illegal mass movement which he had not disavowed and thus gravely
embarrassing India's war effort at a critical time (VI, p. 260).

The political impasse, therefore, continued for the whole of
1943 and the first half of 1944. The nation was angry and
indignant over the continued detention of the _Congress_ leaders,
but the government was not prepared to accede to the demand
for their release. It was only in May 1944, and that too, when
his health deteriorated considerably, that Gandhiji was released.

This release, however, made a slight change in the situation,
since it made it possible for Gandhiji to publicly put his weight
in favour of a new policy both on the question of Congress-government
relations, as well as on the Hindu-Muslim question.
He took a series of steps which were calculated to facilitate a
reconsideration of the policy by all the parties concerned.

_First of all_, he took the opportunity of a press interview
with Mr. Stewart Gelder, the correspondent of _News Chronicle_,
to express his views on the political situation of the time. In
the course of this interview, he was reported to have stated

>that there was a difference between what he would ask today and
what was asked in 1942. Today, he would be satisfied with a
national government in full control of civil administration. It was
not so in 1942 (VI, p. 318).

This was not an ordinary press interview. It 'constituted
my (Gandhiji's) individual effort to end the present deadlock.
They are more addressed to the powers that be than to the
people'. He also addressed two letters to the Viceroy following
the Gelder interview, in the course of which he made the
following categorical statement :

>I am prepared to advise the _working committee_ to declare that,
in view of the changed conditions, _mass civil disobedience_, envisaged
by the resolution of August 1942, cannot be offered and that full
cooperation in the war effort should be given by the _Congress_, if a
declaration of immediate Indian independence is made and a national
government responsible to the central assembly be formed subject
to the proviso that during the pendency of war, the military operations
should continue as at present, but without involving any financial
burden on India. If there is a desire on the part of the British
government for a settlement, friendly talks should take the place of
correspondence. But I am in your hands (VI, pp. 327--28).

_Secondly_, together with these negotiations with the government,
Gandhiji also started negotiations with the _Muslim League_.
The well-known Gandhi-Jinnah talks started in September on
the basis of the Rajagopalachari formula which, as a matter of
fact, was a new version of the proposals which Rajagopalachari
had made in 1942 and which had been rejected at the time by
an overwhelming majority of the _Congress_.

_Thirdly and finalliy_, Gandhiji clarified his stand on the
question of the August struggle. 'The government went mad,
and so did some people. Sabotage and the like were resorted
to and many things were done in the _Congress_ name or in my
name'. On the question of observing 9th August in 1944, he
advised the people 'not to disregard special police prohibitions
for that day' except in Bombay. Even in Bombay, a place 'most
easily accessible to me and the place where the historic meeting
of August '42 was held', the defiance of police prohibition was
to be _symbolic_. He also directed 'those who have gone underground
to discover themselves. They can do so by informing
the authorities of their work in the open without any attempt
to evade or elude the police'. Here, therefore, was a programme
of prohibiting any defiance of authority on a countrywide scale,
but of symbolically holding the banner of resistance aloft.

It was at the very time when Gandhiji was making these
efforts at negotiations that Subhas Bose was organising the _Indian
National Army_. The two policies pursued by the two leaders
were mutually contradictory: one was an attempt to retreat
from the _Quit India_ movement; the other was trying to carry
the movement forward by bringing armed forces from outside
to help the forces of revolt within the country.

Yet, the two were in a sense supplementing each other.
Though Gandhiji was seeking a way of retreat, he was holding
the banner of resistance aloft, as was clear from his 'symbolic
defiance' instruction in Bombay on 9th August. That is why
we find, on the occasion of Gandhiji's 75th birthday in October
1944, _Netaji_ declaring in a speech in Rangoon: 'Father of Our
Nation! In this holy war for India's liberation, we ask for your
blessings and good wishes'. Gandhiji, for his part, refrained
from making any comment, favourable or unfavourable, on
_Netaji_'s programme and activities.

Both policies, however, failed in their immediate objective.
Gandhiji's efforts at negotiations broke against the impenetrable
wall of obstruction put up by the British government. His
offer of full cooperation in the war effort provided Indian independence
was immediately declared and a national government
formed, evoked the reply from the viceroy that it is impossible
during the period of hostilities to bring about any change in the
constitution by which means alone a national government such
as you suggest can be made responsible to the central assembly'.
His negotiations with the _Muslim League_ too ended in failure,
because Jinnah rejected the Rajaji formula and also the terms
suggested by Gandhiji which, according to him, were 'calculated
to completely torpedo the Pakistan demand of Muslim India'.

While Gandhiji's policy of seeking ways of retreat from the
August 1942 position had thus temporarily proved a failure, so
too did _Netaji_'s policy. The opening of the second front in
Europe in 1944, the rapid advance of the Soviet Red Army into
Germany and the heroic struggle of the resistance fighters in
China and other Asian countries were making it clear that
_Netaji_'s policy of an internal revolutionary movement, assisted
from abroad by armed forces organised in cooperation with the
Japanese fascists, had proved abortive. In a few months after
its formation, the _Indian National Army_[^12/1] and its Japanese allies
had to meet the reformed and reorganised forces of the Allied
camp at whose hands they suffered defeat in the end. The INA
disappeared from the scene except as a force which, because of
its very nature and objective, evoked pride and patriotism in
the Indian people.

These very international developments, however, had their
impact on the internal political situation. The inexorable
advance of the Allied forces made it impossible for the British
government to continue to keep the _Congress_ leaders in detention,
or to maintain the stand that no question of constitutional
changes arose because of the conditions of war. It had become
necessary for the government to take new steps in the direction
of making fresh efforts at solving the internal political crisis.

These new efforts started with the release of the members
of the _Congress working committee_ in the middle of June 1945.
This was followed by certain proposals for the re-constitution of
the central executive council,

>so that all its members except the governor-general and the commander-in-chief,
would be the Indian political leaders, the caste
Hindu and the Muslims being equally represented. ... In furtherance
of this plan, the viceroy will call a conference of the party
leaders and provincial premiers and ex-premiers, who will be asked
to submit to him lists of names, from which he can select the personnel
of the new executive council (VII, p. 7).

These efforts, however, failed because of Jinnah's objection
to the inclusion of two nationalist Muslims, Maulana Azad and
Asaf Ali, in the council of ministers. It was becoming clearer that
the communal question in general and the Hindu-Muslim question
in particular, was being taken advantage of by the British rulers
to prevent any change of government.

This raised a storm of indignation among the mass of the
people, who were coming to see in clearer and sharper terms the
real nature of the policies of the government. The failure of the
negotiations for the formation of a national government was followed
by the great countrywide campaign for the release of the
INA prisoners. The defence of the INA prisoners, who were
being tried in the latter half of 1945, became the focal point of a
new wave of anti-imperialist struggles. As Tendulkar says :

>Nehru was present in the court in his barrister's robes, which
he had discarded thirty years ago. Bhulabhai Desai, the defence
counsel, concentrated the nation's attention on the great role played
by the _Indian National Army_ under the inspiring leadership of
Subhas Chandra Bose. ... The country demanded the freedom of the
INA accused and ultimately secured it. 'It became a trial of strength'
said Nehru, 'between the will of the Indian people and the will of
those who hold power in India and it was the will of the people that
triumphed in the end' (VII, pp. 17--8).

While the cause of the men of the _Indian National Army_
was thus galvanising the anti-imperialist movement, that very
movement was having its impact on the men of the Indian armed
forces under the British. The revolt of the _Royal Indian Navy_
symbolised the fact that neither the crushing of the 1942 struggle
nor the defeat of the INA had dampened the spirit of Indian
resistance.

Gandhiji became extremely perturbed over the whole situation.
A week before the RIN mutiny, he had written in _Harijan_:

>Hatred is in the air and the impatient lovers of the country will
gladly take advantage of it, if they can, through violence, to further
the cause of independence. ... The hypnotism of the INA has cast its
spell upon us. _Netaji_'s name is one to conjure with. His patriotism
is second to none. ... My praise and my admiration can go no further.
For I knew that his action was doomed to failure, and that I would
have said so, even if he had brought his INA victorious to India, because
the masses would not have come into their own in this manner
(VII, pp. 76--8).

On the RIN mutiny, he said that he had followed the events
'with painful interest'. He went on :

>This mutiny in the navy and what is following is not, in any
sense of the term, non-violent action ... If the Indian members of the
navy know and appreciate _non-violence_, the way of _non-violent
resistance_ can be dignified, manly and wholly effective, if it is corporate.
... Action like this, I have called non-violent _non-cooperation_.
As it is, they are setting a bad and unbecoming example for India
(VII, pp. 78--9).

This new wave of the anti-imperialist movement made it
obvious to the British government that they could not rule in the
old way. They therefore decided to take new steps to settle
the political crisis. A delegation of three cabinet ministers was
sent to India to carry on negotiations with the various Indian
parties.

They conducted protracted negotiations in April and May
and came out with long-term and short-term proposals. The long-term
proposals envisaged the setting up of a constituent assembly
elected by the newly elected provincial legislatures. The provinces
were to be grouped into A, B, and C and each of the
groups were given the right to secede from the Union --- an
arrangement which would partially meet the demand of the
_Muslim League_. The short-term proposals related to the formation
of an interim government consisting of representatives of
the _Congress_, the _Muslim League_ and other parties and groups.
It was these proposals which, after protracted negotiations,
led to the formation of the interim government in the latter
half of 1946, and a year later, to the creation of the two independent
States of India and Pakistan.


[^12/1]: _Indian National Army (INA)_ was an armed force formed by Indian collaborationists & Imperial Japan on 1 September 1942 in Southeast Asia during World War II. Its aim was to secure Indian independence from British rule. It fought alongside Japanese soldiers in the latter's campaign in the Southeast Asian theatre of WWII. First formed in 1942 under Rash Behari Bose, by Indian PoWs of the British-Indian Army captured by Japan. This first INA collapsed & was disbanded in December. Rash Behari Bose handed over INA to Subhas Chandra Bose (reffered to as _Netaji_). Under Bose, INA drew ex-prisoners & civilian volunteers from the Indian expatriate population in Malaya (present-day Malaysia) and Burma. This second INA fought along with the Imperial Japanese Army against the British & Commonwealth forces in the campaigns in Burma.
