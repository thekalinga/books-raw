# August 15 : Triumph Or Defeat ?

The transfer of power in 1947 is paraded by the _congress_
leaders as a unique event in world history. They claim that,
unlike other revolutions in the world, such as the French, the
Russian, the Chinese, etc., the Indian revolution of 1947 was
brought about without shedding a drop of blood, since it was
led by the apostle of _non-violence_.

This is a claim which was officially made on 15 August 1957.
The 'message to the nation' issued by the then _Congress_ President,
Acharya Kripalani, claimed :

>Never before was so great an event transforming the destiny of
millions of men and women consummated with such little bloodshed
and violence. ... That this has been possible is due to the inspiring
leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, who, if any man may be so-called,
is the Father of our Nation. He has led us in the non-violent battle
for freedom and he has shown us the way to make this freedom
fruitful in the service of our people (VIII, p. 95).

One man, however, did not share this view That man was
Mahatma Gandhi himself. Tendulkar states:

>There were festivities all over the land. But the man who,
more than any one else, had been responsible for freeing India from
the alien rule did not participate in these rejoicings. When an
officer of the Information and Broadcasting Department of the Government
of India came for a message, Gandhi replied that he had
run dry. When told again that if he did not give any message, it
would not be good, Gandhi replied : 'There is no message at all, if
it is bad, let it be so'. (VIII, pp. 95--6). .

More than five months later, on 26 January 1948 --- just four
days before he was murdered-he observed :

>This day, 26th January, is Independence Day. This observance
was quite appropriate, when we were fighting for independence we
had not seen, nor handled. Now! We have handled it and we seem
to be disillusioned. At least I am, even if you are not (VIII, p. 338).

The main reason for this disillusionment was the wave of
communal frenzy that was roused throughout the country, in
the wake of the 1946--47 negotiations between the representatives
of the British government and the leaders of the _Indian National
Congress_, _Muslim League_ and other parties. Never was such
a frenzy witnessed in the history of India's national movement;
never were so many Muslims on the one hand and Hindus and
Sikhs on the other, cold-bloodedly murdered by one another as
in those months preceding and following 15 August.

It had always been Gandhiji's claim that the path which he
had charted out for the Indian people was the path of love,
rather than of hatred. If only the Indian people chose this path,
they would be able to bring about a change in the heart of even
the most violent and brutal oppressors of the nation --- the British
imperialists. Yet, here was a situation in which his method
failed even in uniting the hearts of our own Indian people, not
to speak of changing the hearts of British imperialists.

It should be said to Gandhiji's credit that he was perhaps
the only leader of the _Congress_ who 'frankly and fully' admitted
that the developments leading up to the transfer of power were
indicative not of the triumph but of the defeat of the principles
which he had been preaching during his whole lifetime. He
said on 14 July :

>What we had practised during the past thirty years was not _nonviolent
resistance_, but passive resistance, which only the weak offer
because they are unable, not unwilling, to offer an armed resistance.
If we knew the use of _non-violent resistance_, which only those with
the hearts of oak can offer, we would present to the world a totally
different picture of free India, instead of an India cut in twain, one
part highly suspicious of the other and the two too much engaged
in mutual strife to be able to think cogently of the food and clothing
of the hungry and naked millions, who know no religion but that of
the one and only God, who appears to them in the guise of necessaries
of life (VII, p. 57).

It should further be said to Gandhiji's credit that he continued
up to the last moment of his life and to the last ounce of
his energy to fight against the evil forces of communalism
according to his light. From the first moment when signs were
available of the dangerous communal frenzy that was spreading
throughout the country --- ever since the outbreak of the first
communal riot in Calcutta on 16 August 1946, which had been
declared by the _Muslim League_ as '_Direct Action Day_' --- he
devoted himself to the task of preaching communal harmony.
When the riots started spreading from cities to the villages, he
gave up all other activities in order to spread his message of
unity. It was to this end that he spent several weeks in the
Noakhali district of Bengal, going from village to village. It
was again for this that he left Noakhali for Bihar, wanted to go
to the Punjab, went to Calcutta, and to Delhi. Fighting
the communal frenzy, defending the victims of riots, giving
succour to refugees, etc., became the main theme of his daily
post-prayer addresses.

It was, however, becoming clear that the message that he
was preaching was becoming less effective than ever before.
There had been occasions in the past when his very presence,
or at best his undertaking a fast, was effective in bringing the
people of different communities together, in preventing the
accentuation of the communal situation. Now too, his presence
first in Noakhali, then in Bihar, Calcutta, Delhi and other places
helped the cause of preventing riots to a certain extent or for
a time; but not even the concentration of all his energies to this
particular cause was sufficient to bring about any appreciable
change in the situation even in the locality where he worked,
not to speak of distant places.

The situation was so serious that, at one moment, Gandhiji
even drew the attention of the people to the possibility of a war
between the two states of India and Pakistan. This naturally
produced a great sensation in the country, some people even
suggesting that such a war would have Gandhiji's approval.
He was, therefore, compelled to explain the circumstances in
which he had to refer to the possibility of war :

>We have among us the superstition that the mere mention of
a snake ensures its appearance in the house in which the mention is
made even by a child. I hope that no one in India entertains such
superstition about war. I claim that I rendered a service to both
the sister states by examining the present situation, and definitely
stating when the cause of war could arise between the two States.
And this was done not to promote war, but to avoid it as far as
possible. I endeavoured, too, to show that if the insensate murders,
loot and arson by the people continued, they would force the hands
of their governments. Was it wrong to draw public attention to the
logical steps, that inevitably followed one after another? (VIII,
pp. 169--70).

Gandhiji also knew that the relations between the two
communities were so strained that any one who attempted to
bring about communal unity would earn the hatred of fanatics
on both sides. He knew that he himself was taking great personal
risks in fighting the communal frenzy. Recall his reference
in the course of a talk with Rajkumari Amrit Kaur on 28 January,
to the possibility of his 'dying by the bullets of a mad man' and
his promise that, if it happens, he would 'do so smiling. There
must be no anger within me. God must be in my heart and on
my lips', he said. These words have a melancholy ring today in
the light of what happened just two days later.

Though these were the distressing developments that prevented
Gandhiji from joining the festivities of 15 August, no less
important were the developments inside the _Congress_ itself. For
some time even before the transfer of power, Gandhiji had been
worried to see _Congressmen_ trying to promote their personal
ends through the organisation of which they were members. For
example, he wrote in July 1946 in a note entitled 'A Tragic
Phenomenon':

>My post contains so many letters from persons who want to be
in the constituent assembly, that it frightens me into the suspicion
that, if these letters are an indication of the general feeling, the _intelligentsia_
is more anxious about personal aggrandizement than
about India's independence. ... I write this more to draw attention
to the disease, of which these applications are a sign, than to warn
my correspondents against building any expectation of my intervention
(VII, p. 186).

The 'disease', however, developed further and became a very
serious problem to which Gandhiji's attention was drawn by
several of his correspondents. It was this, along with the dangerous
communal situation, that impelled Gandhiji to undertake his
last fast in January 1948. In the course of his prayer speech on the
evening of 12 January, at which he announced his decision to
fast from the 13th, he quoted from a letter which he had
received from the veteran Andhra Congressman, Deshbhakta
Konda Venkatappayya. That letter stated:

>The one great problem, apart from many other political and
economic issues of a very complicated nature, is the moral degradation
into which the men in the _Congress_ circles have fallen. I cannot
say much about other provinces, but in my province, conditions
are very deplorable. The taste of political power has turned their
heads. ... The factions in the _Congress_ circles, 'the money-making
activities of several of the MLAs and MLCs, and the weakness of
the ministers have been creating a rebellious spirit amongst the
people at large. The people have begun to say that the British
government was much better and they are even cursing the _Congress_
(VIII, pp. 302--03).

While factional squabbles and power politics were thus
rampant in the provincial and district _Congress_ committees,
they were not totally absent in the central leadership either. A
minor crisis broke out in the all-India leadership in November, 1947.

On the very first day in the presence of Gandhi, president
Kripalani told the AICC, that he was resigning his position. He had
neither been consulted by the government, nor had been taken into
their full confidence. He said that the government ignored the
_Congress_ party. Gandhi, Kripalani revealed, felt that, in these circumstances,
the resignation was justified. Nehru and Patel were the
heads of the government. Their popularity and hold on the _Congress_
machine was unquestioned. They identified themselves with
the party. Why then should they accept the _Congress_ president as
a curb on their power? (VIII, p. 233).

While this crisis was tided over by the acceptance of Kripalani's
resignation and his replacement by Rajendra Prasad, the
relations between Sardar Patel and Jawaharlal Nehru deteriorated
further Tendulkar observes that "Gandhi knew of the friction
between Sardar and Nehru and it worried him. He wanted
them to hold together'. It was in this connection that he had a
meeting with Sardar Patel at 4 p.m., on January 30 --- an hour
before he was murdered. It was in this connection, again, that
'Nehru and Azad were to see him after the evening prayers'.

These internal developments in the _Congress_ made Gandhiji
give serious thought to the future of the _Congress_. In the well-known
draft constitution for a reorganised _Congress_, prepared
by him in his last days, he stated:

>The _Congress_, in its present shape and form, as a propaganda
vehicle and a parliamentary machine, has outlived its use. India has
still to attain social, moral and economic independence in terms of
India's seven hundred thousand villages, as distinguished from its
cities and towns. The struggle for the ascendency of civil over military
power is bound to take place in India's progress towards its
democratic goal. The _Congress_ must be kept out of unhealthy competition
with the political parties and communal bodies. For these
and other similar reasons, the _All-India Congress Committee_ resolves
to disband the existing _Congress_ organisation and fiower into a _Lok
Sewak Sangh_ under the following rules with the power to alter them
as occasion may demand (VIII, p. 342).

It is characteristic of Gandhiji, that while all his lieutenants
were celebrating the attainment of _complete independence_, he
was more concerned with the instability of the newly-created
Indian state than feeling happy at its formation. While the other
leaders of the _Congress_ were acclaiming the transfer of power
as the triumph of the Indian national movement under their
leadership, he made it his job to draw people's attention to the
two main sources of India's political instability: _firstly_, the strained
relations between Hindus and Muslims, which, in its turn, led
to strained relations between the two newly-created States of
India and Pakistan; and _secondly_, the decay and degradation
inside the _Congress_ organisation.

It is this that marks him out from the other leaders of the
_Congress_. With his finger on the pulse of the people, Gandhiji
was able to see that, unless a radical transformation was brought
about in the state of Hindu-Muslim relations and unless the state
of internal organisation of the _Congress_ was improved, the new
Indian state was in danger of collapse.

Furthermore, Gandhiji had no personal axe to grind, he represented
the _bourgeois_ class as a whole and not an individual
or group among the _bourgeoisie_; he was therefore able to look
at every problem from the point of view of the long-range
interests of his class as a whole, rather than from the narrow,
petty, personal or group interests of sections of the _bourgeoisie_.
He was able to see not only the main sources of the
instability of the new state with a certain amount of objectivity,
but also to do his utmost to remove these sources of instability.
Herein lies the greatness of Gandhiji as the ideological-political
leader of the Indian _bourgeoisie_.

Gandhiji was able to put his finger at the two main sources
of the instability and to see why these sources should arise at the
very time when the state was being founded. Characteristically
he was, however, unable to give any rational explanation as to
why, after three decades of his preaching the gospel of love, he
had had the misfortune to see in his last days the Indian people
so divided into two warring communal camps that the very consummation
of his political aim --- the creation of an independent
Indian state led --- to the creation of two antagonistic States set
up on the basis of religion. Nor could he offer any convincing
explanation as to why the very people, who had, under his
leadership, made tremendous sacrifices for the cause of the
nation, started quarrelling among themselves for power and personal
aggrandizement.

The only reason which he could find for these distressing
developments was that Man --- the very Man whose moral regeneration
was the objective for which he had evolved his theory
and practice of _non-violent resistance_ --- had gone mad. But how
was it that the three decades in which he preached the gospel
of love and _non-violence_ witnessed the transformation not of
Man the Mad into Man the Sober, but the other way round?
This is a question which so baffled him that he could do nothing
more than put his trust in God.

Though he was, in practice, putting up a courageous fight
against the evil forces of communalism, he had lost all his self-confidence,
lost even his joy of life and will to live. In his reply
to a correspondent on the occasion of his birthday in 1947, he
wrote:

>Without doubt, the ideal thing would be, neither to wish to live
125 years, nor to wish to die now. Mine must be a state of complete
resignation to the Divine Will. And if I had the impertinence openly
to declare my wish to live 125 years, I must have the humility, under
changed circumstances, openly to shed that wish. ... I invoke the aid
of the all-embracing Power to take me away from this 'vale of tears',
rather than make me a helpless witness of the butchery by man become
savage, whether he dares to call himself a Muslim or Hindu
or what not. (VII, p. 176).

Herein lies the limitation of the greatness of Gandhiji. Circumscribed
as his vision was by the world-outlook of the _bourgeoisie_,
he was unable to see that neither the deterioration in
communal relations nor the degeneration of the _Congress_ on the
eve and after the transfer of power was accidental, but the result
of the operation of certain laws of social development. If he
had been able to see this, he would have known that the HinduMuslim
conflicts were the results not of something inherently
wrong with the mass of Hindus and Muslims but because certain
definite social forces were working to incite them against each
other. He would then have made up his mind not to leave the
fate of the Hindu and Muslim masses to God's will, but would
have fought those social forces which were working to bring
about Hindu-Muslim conflicts.

Having no such understanding of the social forces working
for communal disruption, Gandhiji was probably more afraid of
unity in the struggle against reactionary elements than even
communal riots. Take, for example, how he dreaded the militant
unity of Hindus and Muslims which manifested itself in the
RIN revolt:

>This mutiny in the navy and what is following is not, in any
sense of the term, non-violent action. ... A combination between
the Hindus and the Muslims and others for the purpose of violent
action is unholy and it will lead to and probably is a preparation for
mutual violence --- bad for India and the world. ... Aruna would
'rather unite Hindus and Muslims at the barricade than on the constitution
front'. Even in terms of violence, this is a misleading proposition.
... Emphatically it betrays want of foresight to disbelieve
the British declarations and precipitate a quarrel in anticipation. ...
Aruna and her comrades have to ask themselves every time whether
the non-violent way has or has not raised India from her slumber
of ages and has created in them a yearning, very vague perhaps, for
_swaraj_. There is, in my opinion, only one answer (VII, pp. 78--81.
Emphasis added).

The same thing holds true of Gandhiji's failure to see the
reason for the degeneration of _Congressmen_. Frowning as he
did on the theory of class struggle, acknowledging as he claimed
to do the goodness of the individual, even of the landlord and
capitalist classes, he was unable to see that the upper and middle
class politicians, who composed the leadership of the _Congress_,
were as much likely to quarrel among themselves for personal
ends after securing power as they were in making personal sacrifices
while fighting for power. Unable to see this reason for the
paradoxical phenomenon of hitherto selfless men and women
being transformed into shameless self-seekers, Gandhiji was unable
to offer any explanation for the moral degradation in the
ranks of the _Congress_ which he was able to see but not check.
The result was that he who began with the assumption of the
essential goodness of individuals ended up by the theory of men
having run mad and deteriorated.

It is a significant fact of history that the very occasion which
gladdened the hearts of millions upon millions of the Indian
people --- the occasion of their attainment of freedom --- was chosen
by Gandhiji to express the view that his mission in life (regeneration
of Man) was a failure. No better, no more convincing
verdict can be given of the triumph of _Gandhism_ as the political
strategy and tactics of the _bourgeoisie_ in its struggle against the
British and its total failure as a new social philosophy, a new
method to regenerate Man.
