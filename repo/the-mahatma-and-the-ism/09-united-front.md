# United Front

This was a strategy which was fully in keeping with the
political requirements of the right-wing leadership of the _Congress_.
Faced as they were with the challenge of the British
Government in the form of the new constitution that was soon
to be forced on the people, the _Congress_ leadership could not
afford to have any deep division inside the organisation. Differences
between the right and the left, differences between such
social philosophies as _Gandhism_, modern socialism and _bourgeois_
parliamentarianism, differences on social and religious questions
--- all these had to be adjusted with a view to enabling the
_Congress_ as an organisation to offer a _united front_ against the
national enemy. Accommodating the socialists and other left
forces while preserving the dominant position of the parliamentarians
and other rightists was thus of supreme importance
for the right-wing _Congress_ leadership.

It was, however, not only a question of accommodating the
socialists and other leftists inside the _Congress_. Something more
was needed. The forces of the left had to be put in such a
position that the large mass of the working people and the
growing ranks of socialist-minded and other radical youth are
given the confidence that the _Congress_ is pursuing a genuine
policy of radical anti-imperialism. It was this consideration
that made the _Congress_ leadership adopt the same technique
as they did in 1929 --- put the leader of the left at the head of the
organisation. Just as in 1929, so also in 1946, Nehru was elected
president of the _Congress_. What is more, when his term was
over and a new president had to be elected in 1937, he was
re-elected. As if two successive terms for Nehru were not
enough, the presidentship of the _Congress_ was then given to
another leader of the left: Subhas Chandra Bose was elected to
succeed Nehru in 1938. During all these terms of leftist presidents
of the _Congress_, the _Congress working committee_ included members
of the _Congress Socialist Party_ and other leftists. How the
leaders of the right looked upon this left orientation of the
_Congress_ was explained by Sardar Patel in 1936, when his name
was proposed for the presidentship and he withdrew in favour
of Nehru :

>My withdrawal should not be taken to mean that I endorse all
the views Jawaharlal stands for. Indeed, _Congressmen_ know that.
On some vital matters, my views are in conflict with those held by
Jawaharlal. ... There may be a sharp division of opinion between
Jawaharlal and myself, or rather among _Congressmen_. We know
him to be too loyal to the _Congress_ to disregard the decision of the
majority, assuming that the latter lays down a policy repugnant to
him. The president has no dictatorial powers. He is the chairman
of our well-built organisation. The _Congress_ does not part with its
powers by electing any individual, no matter who he is. I ask the
delegates to plumb for Jawaharlal as being the best person to represent
the nation and guide in right channel the different forces
that are at work in the country (IV, p. 132).

This indeed was a policy which paid rich dividends.
Nehru's two-year term of presidentship (1936--38), the election
manifesto and the agrarian programme drafted under his guidance
and with the collaboration of the socialists, the hurricane
tour that Nehru undertook for the popularisation of the two
documents, the selfless activity of tens of thousands of leftminded
youth who were roused by the radical slogans popularised
by Nehru --- these were a very big factor in mobilising millions
of people behind the _Congress_ and against reactionary
forces in the 1937 general elections. The fact that communal
and other reactionary forces were routed and the _Congress_
came out with comfortable majorities in 7 out of 11 provinces
was mainly due to this leftist orientation of the _Congress_
agitation.

This leftist orientation of the _Congress_ also helped its
leadership in the post-election months when serious differences
arose between the _Congress_ and the British government. The
new constitution under which elections had taken place and
new legislatures formed, conferred extremely wide powers on
provincial governors which, if exercised, would make a mockery
of the elected legislatures and ministries responsible to them.
The _Congress_ leadership, therefore, wanted an assurance from
the British that these powers would not be used, as a condition
precedent to the acceptance of ministries in those provinces
where it had been returned in a majority. The British were not
prepared to give this assurance. There was, therefore, a deadlock
on the question; a breakdown of the entire constitution at
the very time when it was being brought into force was feared.

It was only the solid unity of the _Congress_ organisation
--- a unity that made it clear to the British that non-acceptance of
the _Congress_ demands would lead to serious consequences
--- that forced them to retreat from the original position. At the
end of a prolonged public debate, in which the secretary of
state for India, Lord Zetland, spoke for the British government
and Gandhiji for the _Congress_ (incidentally, the role played by
Gandhiji in this controversy shows the real character of his
retirement from _Congress_ leadership), the _Congress_ and the
British came to an arrangement which was not entirely satisfactory
from the national point of view and which was criticised
by radical elements from within the _Congress_, yet enabled the
_Congress_ to come to a decision in favour of forming ministries.

This decision changed Gandhiji's method of working. No
more was he going to stick to the earlier decision of confining
his activities to the _constructive programme_ alone. On 17 July
1937, he wrote in the _Harijan_:

>Since the _working committee_ and other _Congressmen_ have
allowed themselves to be influenced by my opinion on office acceptance
issue, it is perhaps due to the public for me to explain my
conception of office acceptance and what is possible to do in terms
of the _Congress_ election manifesto. I need offer no apology for
crossing the self-imposed limit in the conduct of _Harijan_. The
reason is obvious. The _Government of India Act_ is universally
regarded as wholly unsatisfactory for achieving India's freedom.
But it is possible to construe it as an attempt, however limited and
feeble, to replace the rule of the sword by the rule of the majority.
The creation of the big electorate of three crores of men and women
and the placing of wide powers in their hands cannot be described
by any other name. Underlying it is the hope that what has been
imposed upon us we shall get to like, that is, we shall really regard
our exploitation as a blessing in the end. The hope may be frustrated,
if the representatives of the thirty million voters have a
faith of their own and are intelligent enough to use the powers
--- including the holding of offices --- placed in their hands, for the purpose
of thwarting the assumed intention of the framers of the Act.
And this can be easily done by lawfully using the Act in a manner
not expected by them and by refraining from using it in the way
intended by them (IV, p. 207).

This was the beginning of a new phase in Gandhiji's leadership
of the _Congress_ organisation. Still continuing to remain
formally outside the organisation, he nevertheless became the
dominant force in guiding the various _Congress_ ministries. Week
after week, he wrote in the _Harijan_ by way of advising the
ministries as to how they should conduct themselves and what
they should do under various circumstances. Tendulkar remarks
that the newspapers described his writings in those days as the
'instrument of instructions'. Through the columns of the _Harijan_,
as well as through his personal advice to the ministers and other
_Congress_ leaders, Gandhiji laid down the policy on such questions
as prohibition, education, taxation, etc. It was again he
who effectively intervened in all those cases where the _Congress_
ministers in the provinces had to, and did come in conflict with
the governors or the Viceroy. For example, it was he who acted
as the political spokesman of the _Congress_ in the ministerial
conflicts which developed on the issue of release of political
prisoners in Bihar and UP. It was again because of his intervention
that the threatened crisis in Orissa was averted when
conflict arose over the appointment of a civilian official subordinate to the ministry as the governor.

However, the very unity of the left and the right in a
common organisation at whose head stood the leader of the left,
enormously strengthened the forces of the left. Ideas of socialism,
of militant and uncompromising anti-imperialism, of anti-landlord
and anti-capitalist struggles, of unity and solidarity
with the anti-imperialist, anti-fascist and peace forces through
out the world --- these began to grip the people on a scale never
before thought possible. Organisations of the working class,
the peasantry, the students and youth and other sections of the
people, as well as the _Congress_ socialists, the communists and
other parties and elements which spoke in the name of _scientific
socialism_, began to grow at an unprecedented pace. The millions of common people in the so-called 'Indian States' were
awakened to a new sense of their rights and embarked on struggles
for democratic constitutions in their respective States.

All these were, of course, partly the result of developments
in the international field --- the growing might of the Soviet
Union, the success of anti-fascist forces in Europe, the epic
battles of the anti-fascist and national-liberation forces in Spain,
China and Abyssinia, etc. The reflection of this new consciousness,
even inside the _Congress_ leadership, was a powerful factor
in the consolidation of the new forces of radical anti-imperialism
and socialism.
