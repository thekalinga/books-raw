# On _Poorna Swaraj_

While the _congress_ under Gandhiji's inspiration was carrying
out the _council entry_-cum-_constructive programme_, two new
forces were appearing on the arena of national politics --- the
forces of communalism (Hindu and Muslim) and the forces of
radical anti-imperialism. Both began to emerge on the scene
after the suspension of the _civil disobedience_ movement and as
a result of the sense of frustration and political confusion that
flowed from it. Each, in its own peculiar way, hampered
Gandhiji and his colleagues in the _Swarajist_ and the _constructive
worker_ camps in the carrying out of their respective programmes.

The split which occurred inside the _Congress_ when _civil disobedience_
was suspended, was soon followed by differences within
the _Swarajist_ camp itself. The original idea of using the council
chambers for purposes of exposure and propaganda was soon
given up by a section of the original _Swarajists_ in favour of the
so-called policy of 'responsive cooperation', on the basis of
which they formed their own separate group. This difference
on the question of concrete tactics to be pursued inside the
legislatures quickly gave way to further differences, which
assumed a communal character.

Many of the non-cooperators of the 1921 period became
champions of the sectional claims of this or that community.
Communal organisations in general, and those of Hindus and
Muslims in particular, began to grow and make tall claims for
their respective communities. What was worse, these sectional
claims of particular communities found their champions even
among well-known leaders of the _Congress_, some of whom
helped Hindu communal organisations while others helped their
Muslim counterparts.

Communalism, however, did not confine itself to the making
of claims and counter-claims at the top level alone; it enveloped
the whole public life of the country. Issues like cow-slaughter,
music before mosques, conversion and reconversion
of individuals from one religion to another --- all these assumed
serious proportions and, in several instances, led to clashes and
even murders. The atmosphere of communal unity, which had
been generated in the days of _non-cooperation_ and _Khilafat_ and
which gave a national, democratic character to the movement
gave place to one of acute tension.

Gandhiji's reaction to this situation was characteristic. The
sensitive soul in him revolted at the internecine quarrel that had
destroyed the exhilarating atmosphere of the glorious days of
_non-cooperation_. His heart bled at the inhuman deeds perpetrated
by people who spoke in the name of God, but acted as
agents of Satan. Against the indescribable horrors that had been
perpetrated in the name of religion, he entered his first public
protest by undertaking a fast for bringing peace and harmony.

This had, of course, a temporary effect. Leaders of different
communities came together and promised Gandhiji that they
would do their utmost to preserve communal peace. But it had
no lasting effect on the public life of the country. On the contrary,
the further the _Congress_ under Gandhiji's leadership advanced
in the direction of successful struggle for _swaraj_, the
worse became the communal situation. At every subsequent
phase in the struggle against imperialism, the communal situation
became the biggest stumbling block in Gandhiji's way. In
the end, it led to a distorted type of _swaraj_ which was a blow
against all that that Gandhiji stood for --- the partition of India
into the Hindu-majority Indian Union and Muslim-majority
Pakistan - and his own tragic end at the hands of an assassin
risen from the ranks of the Hindu communalists.

Gandhiji's reaction to the emergence of the forces of communalism
was, however, not confined to mere humanitarian
horror at the atrocities that were committed in the name of religion.
Being, above all, a politician striving to unite the various
classes, communities and sections of the Indian people in the
struggle for _swaraj_, he quickly realised that the communal problem
should be seen not only as a human problem of relations
between people following different religions, but also as a practical,
_political_ problem. He saw it as a problem of adjusting the
claims and counter-claims of different sections of the Indian
people in the matter of sharing the power that was sought to be
wrested from the British rulers.

_Swaraj_ was impossible of achievement unless there was a
certain amount of agreement as to what constituted its form and
content, unless different sections of the people were made to
understand what they could expect from the new constitutionalpolitical
set-up that would be established on its attainment. This
was all the more important at a time when lacking any rational
political argument against conceding the demand for _Swaraj_, the
British rulers were utilising the division and disunity among the
various communities as the most important argument in their
favour.

Lord Birkenhead, the then secretary of state for India,
threw out a challenge to the Indian politicians to draw up a
constitution that would be acceptable to all sections of the people.
He was confident that the claims and counter-claims that
would inevitably be made by the Hindus and Muslims against
each other and the Christians, the untouchable castes, etc.,
against both, not to speak of such 'interests' as Europeans, the
princes, the landlords, etc., would completely negate the
national and democratic demands that would be put forward
by the _Congress_ and other non-communal democratic elements.

This was a challenge that had to be taken up --- if the _Congress_,
as the premier national political organisation of the country
--- was to survive. And it was taken up. The _Congress_ took
initiative in convening an _All-Parties Committee_ with the elder
Nehru (Motilal) as its chairman and the younger (Jawaharlal)
as its secretary. The report that it produced (_the Nehru Report_)
and the draft constitution which it put forward became the
rallying point of big sections of politicians of all communities,
though vital differences still persisted on such questions as
separate electorate, reservation of seats, distribution of powers
between the centre and provinces, etc.

While this unity of the _Congress_, liberals and other sections
of the topmost politicians around _the Nehru Report_ was a big
achievement of the _Swarajist_ leaders under Gandhiji's blessing,
a challenge to the whole approach underlying this unity was
coming from the second of the two new forces mentioned earlier
--- the forces of radical anti-imperialism.

The suspension of _civil disobedience_ had roused the indignation
of large sections of ordinary _Congress_ workers and volunteers.
A feeling of being betrayed by their own leaders, at the
very moment when the enemy was at its weakest, had gripped
hundreds of thousands of _Congressmen_. They felt that something
was wrong in the way Gandhiji led the movement, but
were not at one with the new politics that was sought to be imported
into the _Congress_ by Das, the elder Nehru, the elder Patel
and others. They were, therefore, in the camp of _no-changers_
in the sense that they were against _council entry_. They, however,
had very little in common with the politics of the _no-changers_,
which, for the time being, were, after all, those of the
_constructive programme_. Therefore, dissatisfied with both, they
felt helpless and frustrated, sensing that something was wrong
and yet unable to locate it, desiring a change yet unable to find
what that change ought to be.

It was into the midst of such disillusioned _Congressmen_
that new ideas began to come from abroad --- ideas of militant
anti-imperialism (from Ireland and Egypt), ideas of radical
social and cultural changes (from Turkey), ideas of socialism
(from Soviet Russia). Together with the entry of these ideas
into the minds of disillusioned young _Congressmen_, new classes
and sections of society were making their debut in active public
life.

Particularly important in this connection was the rise of the
working class as a force to reckon with in the 1920's. The strike
movement that had become a feature of the industrial and political
life of the country, preceding and during the _non-cooperation_
movement, was slowly consolidating itself into trade unions,
the initial form of class organisation of the working class. The
_All-India Trade Union Congress_, which came on the scene of
industrial relations, and which was used by the government as
the machinery for selecting delegates for the International
Labour Organisation (ILO) conferences, was based on a growing
number of trade unions. Many of these unions were led by
young nationalists who, through their very association with the
working class, began to slowly imbibe the ideas to which the
working class is particularly attached --- ideas of radical anti-imperialism
and social justice.

Naturally, therefore, the young nationalists who went to the
working class and actively participated in their struggles became
the core of the movement for the new ideals of radical
anti-imperialism, social and cultural revolution and socialism.
Scattered groups of socialists and even communists began to
emerge in the industrial cities of Bombay and Calcutta. They
slowly spread to other centres of political activity and, in the
end, led to the formation of such organisations as the Workers'
and Peasants' Party.

It was, however, not only the section which went to the
working class that became the vehicle for the communication of
the new ideas of radical anti-imperialism. Even among those
who confined themselves to the urban _petty bourgeoisie_, these
ideas began to grow and crystallise. Some of them were wedded
to the cult of individual terrorism. The post-_non-cooperation_
days witnessed a rapid growth of such groups, and a corresponding
growth in the number of 'actions' resorted to by them. There
were, however, other groups which were not wedded to individual
terrorism but who, nevertheless, refused to accept either
the philosophy of _non-violence_ and _constructive programme_
preached by Gandhiji, or the politics of _council entry_ adopted by
the _Swarajists_. Heroic and self-sacrificing as they were, these
radical anti-imperialists drew the admiration of large masses of
_Congressmen_, many of whom did not agree with their politics,
yet found in them the true representatives of a nation struggling
to be free.

These radical anti-imperialists were, of course, organised in
scattered local groups without any organised all-India leadership
to guide their activities. There were very sharp and vital
differences of policy which separated one group from another
--- differences as sharp as, if not sharper than, those between the
_Swarajists_ and _no-changers_, the _responsive cooperators_ and the
the other _Swarajists_, the _Congressmen_ and the liberals, etc. Yet,
the wide public discussion that followed Lord Birkenhead's
challenge to the nation and the _Congress_ response to it by way
of the _All-Parties Conference_ and _the Nehru Report_, provided
a central issụe on which all these groups came to be united --- the
issue of the nation's goal.

As opposed to the whole camp of politicians, who rallied
themselves around _the Nehru Report_, the radical anti-imperialist
youth of the country united itself under the banner of _complete
independence_. The unity that was brought about between
Gandhiji, Motilal Nehru, the 'moderates' and others was based
on their common acceptance of the idea that the goal of India's
struggle was _dominion status_[^6/1], as enjoyed by Canada, Australia
and other countries of the British Empire. It was to this that
the challenge came from the united voice of all those who were
organised in the various groups of radical anti-imperialists.
They demanded that the _Congress_ should categorically reject
the idea of _dominion status_ and make complete separation of
India from the British empire the objective of her struggle.

This was a demand which rallied not only the radical groups
organised outside the _Congress_, but also drew into its fold big
sections of radicals from inside the _Congress_ itself. Nor were
they confined to the ranks of ordinary _Congressmen_; among
them could be seen such eminent _Congressmen_ as Jawaharlal
Nehru, who was then the general secretary of the _Congress_ and
also acted as the general secretary of the _All-Parties Committee_;
Subhas Chandra Bose, on whom had fallen the mantle of _Deshbandhu
Das_ as the leader of the _Bengal Congress_; Srinivasa
Iyengar, who was the president of the Gauhati Session of the
_Congress_; Satyamurti, one of the effective parliamentarians of
the _Congress_, etc. The slogan of _Poorna Swaraj_ was so powerful
and appealing to the mass of _Congressmen_ that the 1927
session of the _Congress_ (Madras) adopted a resolution, declaring
it as the goal of the _Congress_.

Gandhiji was opposed to the whole idea. As he had made
himself clear in the days of the first world war, he was a friend
of the British Empire. His only quarrel with the Empire was
that Indians and other subjects of the emperor were not
allowed to enjoy, what he considered to be the benefits of
their connection with the Empire. His demand, therefore, was
only that Indians should have the same rights as the Canadians,
the Australians and the New Zealanders. He totally disapproved
of the action of the _Madras Congress_ and made no secret of it:

>The _Congress_ stultifies itself by repeating year after year resolutions
of this character when it knows that it is not capable of
carrying them into effect. By passing such resolutions, we make an
exhibition of our impotence, become the laughing-stock of critics
and involve the contempt of our adversary. ... We have almost
sunk to the school boys' debating society (II, p. 402).

The two years that elapsed between the Madras session of
1927, when the _Congress_ adopted _complete independence_ as its
_goal_, and the _Lahore Session_ of 1929, when it adopted it as the
_immediate objective_, as opposed to distant goal, were years of
furious controversy. Both Mahatma Gandhi as well as Motilal
Nehru tried their best to convince Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas
Bose, Srinivasa Iyengar and other leaders of the _complete independence
school_ that they were fighting for a word, that there
was no difference in substance between _dominion status_ and
_complete independence_. Gandhiji, for example, wrote in _Young
India_ (12 January 1928):

>I submit that _swaraj_ is an all-satisfying goal for all time. We
the English-educated Indians often unconsciously make the terrible
mistake of thinking that the microscopic minority of the Englishspeaking
Indians is the whole of India. I defy any one to give for
independence a common Indian word intelligible to the masses. Our
goal at any rate may be known by an indigenous word understood
by the three hundred millions. And we have such a word in _swaraj_,
first used in the name of the nation by Dadabhai Naoroji. It is infinitely
greater than and includes independence (II, p. 428).

Almost a year later, concluding the Calcutta Session of the
_Congress_, Motilal Nehru said:

>I would give you one word of advice. Erase from your mind
from today those two terms borrowed from foreign language, namely,
_independence_ and _dominion status_, and take to the words _swaraj_
and _azadi_. Let us, work for _swaraj_ by whatever name we might call
it (II, p. 441).

This open opposition of the two topmost leaders of the _Congress_,
however, did not weaken the movement for replacing the
goal of _dominion status_ with that of _complete independence_.
On the other hand, the more the days that passed since the
_Madras Congress_, the greater became the strength of the movement.
_The Independence of India League_, organised by Jawaharlal
Nehru, Subhas Bose, Srinivasa Iyengar, Satyamurti and
others became the rallying point for thousands of young _Congressmen_
and thus brought about what subsequently may have
developed into an alternative leadership for the _Congress_.

Sensing this situation, Gandhiji tried to effect a compromise
between the _dominion status_ and _complete independence
school_s. The compromise was that, while adhering to the goal
of _complete independence_, the _Congress_ would accept _dominion
status_, provided it was conceded within a year. If, however,
this was not conceded within the stipulated period, the Gandhi-Motilal
Nehru group of leaders would themselves agree to have
the _Congress_ committed to _complete independence_ and, what is
more, organise non-violent _non-cooperation_ for its achievement.

This compromise was put in the form of a resolution to be
moved at the Calcutta (1928) Session of the _Congress_. This was
a comprise to which Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Bose had,
at first, agreed. But, due to pressure from the ranks of their
own followers, they had in the end to move an amendment to
the compromise resolution. Gandhiji, however, could carry a
majority of the delegates behind the compromise resolution, but
the very fact that as many as 973 delegates voted against waiting
for another year (as against 1350 for such waiting) showed how
great was the impatience with the politics of _dominion status_
and negotiations.

The British government, however, was not prepared to
oblige the Gandhi-Motilal leadership by conceding their demand.
While the majority of _Congressmen_ had come to a
position in which they would not be satisfied even with _dominion
status_, the British were not prepared for anything more
than provincial autonomy, and that too with all the possible
'safeguards' that could be provided for such minority 'interests'
as the Europeans, landlords, etc., not to speak of the 'safeguards'
for the Muslims and other minority communities. The
Gandhi-Motilal leadership, in collaboration with the 'moderates'
like Sapru, carried on their efforts at negotiations down to the
very last moment. Even as late as on the eve of the _Lahore
Session_ (1929) of the _Congress_ in which the 'year of grace'
given by the _Calcutta Congress_ would expire, a final attempt was
made to find some basis of agreement between the _Congress_ and
the British government.

It is characteristic of Gandhiji that, while thus striving to
open negotiations with the British, he was preparing for the
second contingency visualised at the _Calcutta Congress_, e.g.,
the demand for _complete independence_. He realised that this
contingency could be faced only by making such a gesture
to the radical anti-imperialist section inside the _Congress_ as
would unite the entire _Congress_ under his own leadership. Such
a gesture was made by him when he proposed the name of
Jawaharlal Nehru for the presidentship of the _Lahore Session_
of the _Congress_.

There were many among his followers who demanded that,
since this was a session which was likely to give a call for
countrywide _direct action_, he himself should stand at the head
of the _Congress_. There were others who proposed the name of
the younger (Vallabhbhai) Patel, because they thought that
since he was the leader of the successful peasant struggle in
Bardoli --- which came to be looked upon as a model for any
future struggle for the realisation of _complete independence_ --- it
was proper that he should be asked to accept the presidentship.
Gandhiji rejected both these proposals.

Rebutting the arguments of those who feared that this
transfer of power from the old to the young may prove disastrous
to the _Congress_, he said:

>A lover of discipline, he (Jawaharlal) has shown himself to be
capable of rigidly submitting to it even where it has seemed irksome.
He is undoubtedly an extremist thinking far ahead of his
surroundings. But he is humble and practical enough not to force
the pace to the breaking point (II, pp. 489--90).

Addressing the youth in general, Gandhiji told them that
they are on their trial and asked them to take Jawaharlal's
election as a tribute to their services.

Referring to steam 'which becomes a mighty power only
when it allows itself to be imprisoned in a strong little reservoir
and produces tremendous motion', he went on to say, 'even so
have the youth of the country of their free will to allow their
inexhaustible energy to be imprisoned, controlled and set free
in strictly measured and required quantities'.

Jawaharlal's election as the president of the _Congress_ was
thus a step through which Gandhiji brought together the old
_Swarajists_ and _no-changers_. It was also the first step he took
in the direction of 'imprisoning, controlling and setting free in
strictly measured and required quantities' the anti-imperialist
ferment that was then sweeping the country, especially among
the youth. He took the initiative in seeing that the left movement
--- the movement in the direction of modern socialism
--- was brought within the framework of his own (_bourgeois_
leadership, rather than allowing it to develop on independent
class lines.

The election of Jawaharlal Nehru as president of the _Congress_
and the declaration of _complete independence_ at the
_Lahore Session_ were hailed by the champions of _complete independence_
as their victory. Behind this victory, however, can
be seen a real compromise between the two schools of _dominion
status_ and _complete independence_ --- a compromise which had
been attempted at Calcutta but failed. The basis of this compromise
can be seen in two important documents from which
Tendulkar gives extracts.

In an article written a few weeks before the _Lahore Congress_,
Gandhiji said:

>I can wait for the _dominion status_ constitution, if I can get the
real _dominion status_ in action, if today, there is a real change of
heart, a real desire on the part of the British people to see India a
free and self-respecting nation and on the part of the officials in
India a true spirit of service. ... _My conception of dominion status
implies present ability to sever the British connection if I wish to_.
(II, p. 502. emphasis added).

Jawaharlal Nehru in his presidential address at Lahore almost
echoed the sentiments of Gandhiji:

>Independence for us means complete freedom from British domination
and British imperialism. Having attained our freedom,
I have no doubt that India will welcome all attempts at world cooperation
and federation, and will even agree to give up part of her
cown independence to a larger group of which she is an equal member
(II, p. 504. emphasis added).

In other words, while Gandhiji accepted _complete independence_
with his own interpretation of it, Jawaharlal agreed
to consider some limits to independence after it was won.

This narrowing down of the difference, together with the
realisation that only a mass struggle would force the British to
concede the nation's demand, regardless of whether it was the
one conceived by Gandhiji or that conceived by Nehru, made it
necessary for them to agree to carry out the _Calcutta Congress_
decision on _complete independence_, and start preparations for a
struggle. That is why Gandhiji declared at the _Lahore Congress_:
'We are now entering upon a new era. Our objective
--- and not our distant goal --- is _complete independence_'.


[^6/1]: The term _dominion_ was used to refer to one of several self-governing nations of the British Empire. "_Dominion status_" was accorded to Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Newfoundland, South Africa, and the Irish Free State at the 1926 Imperial Conference to designate "autonomous communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs, though united by a common allegiance to the Crown and freely associated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations”.
