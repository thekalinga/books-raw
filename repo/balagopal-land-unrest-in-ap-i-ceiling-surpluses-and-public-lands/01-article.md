_More than 40 lakh acres of public land have been distributed over
the decades to the poor in Andhra Pradesh, perhaps the largest
in the country. However, a substantial proportion has been
alienated to the non-poor. The law makes it incumbent on the
government to have these lands returned to the assignees, but this
has not happened. It is this issue of assigned land that is driving
protests in the state. The first of a three-part series on the
land question._

That land would ever be a political
issue in the 21st century was probably
unthinkable at the end of the
20th. In third world countries particularly,
the question of land has been a
"communist one" and the era of communism
of course is seen to have expired
in the year 1989 or thereabouts.

Yet it was inevitable. The 21st century
began with the declaration that nature was
created by god so that capital may be
invested to add value to it, and what more
profuse resource than land? And so suddenly
governments, which till yesterday
pretended that while it may be desirable
to give the poor land for cultivating food
or putting up huts, they were helpless and
properly sorry about it because there was
no land available and the poor should try
breeding less instead, now discovered
that there was any amount of land available
to be put at the disposal of the
corporates for investment, and the rich
in general for building nice big nests for
themselves. _Special Economic Zones_
(_SEZs_) --- which are not factory sites but
nice and spacious townships --- are being
sanctioned left, right and centre, and
industrialists who ask for land are being
given huge tracts without asking why
they need so much. Builders who propose
to construct out-of-the-world residential
colonies for the rich too are also being
allotted as much land as they want.
Andhra Pradesh appears to be among the
leading states in this bonanza.

# Land Agitation

That is why the agitation for land taken
up by the _CPI(M)_ and _CPI_ in this state,
which attracted nationwide attention when
policemen armed with automatic weapons
mowed down six persons (a seventh died
later in hospital) at a peaceful road blockade
at Mudigonda in Khammam district
on July 28, has seen considerable mass
participation. They had two demands, one
of them simple and straightforward: a
hundred square yards of house site for all
the homeless, which the government should
have no difficulty finding because it is
able to find thousands of acres for _SEZs_,
and for the rich in general.

The sad fact that lies behind this demand
is that Indian law gives its citizens no
right to shelter. The lack of a right to
work and a right to education (until recently)
have often been commented upon,
but the lack of a right to shelter is even
more insuperable because shelter requires
a parcel of land which, unlike other building
material, cannot be picked or poached
from nature. You are helpless if you are
not born with it or cannot buy it. And the
Supreme Court's exercise in expanding
rights has extended only to declaring, in
tones as ringing as the uninspired language
the judiciary is addicted to would permit,
that shelter is a right, but to nothing more
concrete. It has neither said that the
shelterless have a right to be provided
with at least a place to put up a hut, nor
that if they do put up a hut on public land
their occupation must invariably be
regularised, nor that a reasonable alternative
must necessarily be provided before
asking them to move. While even colonial
land regulations in many parts of the
country (the _Madras Board of Revenue
Standing Orders_, for instance) adopted
the attitude that homeless poor who have
occupied government land shall be given
_occupancy rights_ and not evicted, the
Supreme Court has strangely found it
difficult to say so: the most generous
judgement that has come from the highest
court is that such occupiers of government
land, if they are in occupation for many
years, shall be given at least two weeks
time before being forcibly evicted. As for
provision of alternative house sites to such
hutment dwellers, the Supreme Court has
said in the infamous case of _Almitra
Patel vs Union of India (2000)_ that such
a proposal amounts to _rewarding a pick
pocket_. That the comment was made in
the course of expression of righteous
anger (of which the courts possess
plenty) at slum lords who are said to have
made it a business of setting up slums on
government land does not make it any
the less callous.

While house sites were the focus of the
agitation, the mode of struggle has perforce
extended it to include cultivable land too.
The agitators gather people in large
numbers, identify land in the vicinity that
is known or believed to be government
land, and forcibly occupy it by putting
up red flags, ploughing it symbolically in
some places, and putting up huts in some.
Where it is known that a certain extent
of land is under the illegal occupation of
some prominent person, preferably a
Congressman, the agitators have occupied
it with greater enthusiasm. The positive
aspect of this method is that it is participative
in an active sense. It actually puts
people in possession of some land,
whether they will ever get title to it or
not, and thereby creates more enthusiasm
than the more usual method of giving
applications to the _tehsildar_ and awaiting
his pleasure. It also drives home the belief
that the landless have a right to land and
are not "encroachers" as the government
calls them.

The disquieting part of this method is
that in terms of actual benefit it is
wholly symbolic. Land rights are tightly
circumscribed by the law, and there is no
way that people can simply occupy wasteland
and get title to it. Even if the government
reacts as it should, namely, declare
which part of the land occupied by the
agitators is _leasable_ or _assignable_ in law
and proceeds to confer rights to it, it still
has to follow the legal regime applicable
to such conferment, and it may well turn
out that there are others who are more
eligible than those who have actually
occupied it. The left party leaders have
declared that they have no objection who
gets it so long as the poor get it, but the
participants in the agitation who have
braved police lathis may not be so generous,
and there could be bitterness at the end.
More commonly, the land occupied may
be of the _non-leasable_ or _non-assignable_
category, that is to say pastures, water
course, reserve forest, pathway, graveyard,
etc. Or it may have already been assigned
or leased to some persons who have either
been driven away from the land or found
it difficult to derive livelihood from it. Or
it may be the contested remnant of some
pre-independence estate and not public
land at all. The most convincing answer
given by the left parties to this objection
is that none of these considerations has
ever prevented the rich from occupying
public land, and so occupation by the
poor will at least prevent land grabbing
by the rich. At any rate the left parties
can be credited with having brought the
land rights of the poor, an issue which
had moved on to the political backburner
with the brutal suppression of the _Naxalites_,
back on to the political agenda, and focused
attention on the obscene generosity of the
government in handing over huge estates
of land to the rich.

The other demand raised by the left
parties refers back to an outcome of the
still-born talks between the Congress
government and the other kind of left, the
_Maoists_, in 2004. Probably the only useful
discussion that took place in the course
of that aimless exercise was about land.
Occupation of land by the poor has always
been an integral part of _Naxalite_ activity,
even if it never received the kind of appreciative
treatment the media has reserved
for the _CPI(M)_ and _CPI_; it was ignored
or derided as antisocial lawlessness. The
_Naxalite_ movement has from the beginning
encouraged and led the poor to occupy
both government and private land, though
in later years, especially with the _Maoists_,
it often became symbolic occupation by
armed squads on behalf of the fearful poor.
If it was private land the police often
moved in to evict and arrest the poor who
had occupied it with _Naxalite_ help, and
where the landowner was reluctant to
move back for fear of _Naxalite_ retaliation,
the land has remained fallow. There are
thousands of such acres in the Telangana
districts. Occupation of public land has had
a more mixed fate. Some of it remains with
the poor, especially forest land cleared and
brought under plough by the _adivasis_.

# Institution of a _Land Commission_

In the talks, the _Naxalites_ insisted on
appointment of a _land commission_
consisting of not merely government
representatives or retired judges but also
public-spirited persons with known involvement
in such matters, to go into the
failure of land reforms and the various
schemes for distribution of public land to
the poor. The government was reluctant
to involve the kind of public-spirited
persons the _Naxalites_ wanted in the commission,
but appointed instead a _Land
Committee_ with two cabinet ministers, a
retired journalist, a senior Congressman
and four _IAS officers_ (one of them retired).
This committee which was appointed in
December 2004 at the end of the six
month ceasefire, almost simultaneous with
the government's decision to withdraw
from the talks submitted its report in 2006.
Though the committee is referred to by
the name of Koneru Ranga Rao, the
minister who was its chairperson, its report
is evidently the outcome of a self-critical
exercise by the _IAS officers_ in it, who
not only know why land reforms have
failed but are party to the failure.

_IAS officers_ spend much of their tenure
dealing with rights in public land, either
as administrators or as adjudicators, and
when they judge the failure of public
policy in the matter, they are judging their
own failure as much as that of the policy.
As self-criticism, the _Ranga Rao Committee
report_ is a commendable exercise,
and could well have been subtitled 'The
Frank Confessions of the Land Administration
of Andhra Pradesh'. It is written
in a tone that is blunt for the bureaucracy,
and annotated in desperation with
nostalgic quotations about land from a
variety of persons, all the way from
William Shakespeare and Joseph Conrad
to an American Indian chief answering
the white settlers. The implementation
of the recommendations of this committee
_in toto_ is the other demand of the left
parties' agitation. The government, after
initial reluctance, which was strange as the
report was by a committee consisting of its
own people, has finally come round to accepting
that it would implement all but a
few of the committee's recommendations.

# Koneru Ranga Rao Report

The report begins with a brief statement
of the extent of landlessness in the state.
It estimates that 10 per cent of rural
households are landless and 36 per cent
own less than half an acre. In terms of
operational holdings, 38 per cent are of
size less than 1¼ acre (half a hectare).
Over the years, landlessness has actually
increased among the scheduled castes.
Between 1961 and 1991, within the
category of scheduled castes, the cultivators
among able-bodied workers decreased
from 23 per cent to 12 per cent, and the
proportion of agricultural labourers increased
from 57 per cent to 72 per cent.
In absolute terms, one lakh persons of the
SC communities lost land. And the average
landholding of SC landowners has
decreased over 1975--76 to 1995--96 from
about 3 acres to about 2 acres. Needless
to say, the land is usually of much
poorer quality than the average. Being 16
per cent of the state's population, the
_dalit_ communities control only 7.5 per
cent of the cultivated area in the state.

This indicates a sizeable and growing
problem of landlessness, especially among
the _dalits_. The two remedies envisaged
all over the country are: takeover of land
owned by landlords in excess of a predetermined
ceiling to be distributed to the
landless, and distribution of wasteland in
the control of the government to the landless.
Land declared surplus under ceiling
laws in Andhra Pradesh is 7.90 lakh acres,
of which 2.07 lakhs are not yet distributed,
predominantly (1.47 lakhs out of
the 2.07 lakhs) because they are locked
in litigation. Since the total cultivable area
of the state is about 2.5 crore acres, the
ceiling surplus land distributed amounts
to a little more than 2 per cent of the
total cultivated area. But this number,
slight though it is, is yet mis-leading.
Firstly, much of the land is uncultivable,
because landlords managed to hand over
to the government the least cultivable of
their acres, which the law itself permitted.
And for that reason the beneficiaries of
the distribution have often abandoned the
land to be reoccupied by the landlord. In
the more backward areas of the state,
where the poor live in fear of the landlords,
this reversal has happened even where the
land is not of poor quality. Secondly, in
many cases even this distribution was
merely on paper. Nobody was actually
put in possession of the land.

Placing together this minuscule redistribution
with the statistics concerning
landlessness and near landlessness ---
accounting for 46 per cent of rural population
--- given above, one can understand
why land ceiling is described by the
_Ranga Rao Committee_ as an "unfinished
agenda". That phrase gives the impression
that it can yet be finished, but that will
never be. The committee has a hope that
at least some of the cases earlier decided
in favour of the landlords can be reopened,
as for instance, where they have played
fraud on the courts. It laments the lack
of a provision in the land ceiling laws
whereby an order obtained by fraud could
be reopened, and recommends intro-duction
of such a provision. No such amendment
is in fact necessary for it is a principle
of law reiterated by the courts repeatedly
that "fraud unravels everything". No law
is required to undo an order obtained by
fraud. The real problem is whether the
unravelling effect of bureaucratic indifference
and judicial conservatism will not
turn out to be superior to the same effect
of fraud. More land has escaped the net
of ceiling due to the unsympathetic attitude
of the courts than fraud played by the
landlords.

Yet a few things may still be salvaged:
the committee has noted the fact that those
who are newly purchasing agricultural
land are not filing declarations under the
ceiling law --- they have to file the declaration
within 60 days --- and are not being
prosecuted for that by the government,
though the law provides for a two-year
prison sentence for not filing a decla-ration
in time. Everybody is acting as if ceiling
laws apply only to the landholdings of
the past. The committee's recommendation
that declarations must be insisted upon
may net some land, but all told it will
make little difference in the face of the
massive requirement. The fixing of land
ceiling is not an "unfinished agenda" but
an irretrievably lost opportunity. It has
been hostage to the _law of property_ as
written into the Indian Constitution and
as understood by the courts. This is politely
referred to as "legal hurdles" by the
committee, but the law itself, namely, the
_law of property_ as understood by the
courts, is the biggest hurdle. The judiciary
has a uniform and deep love of property,
which has coloured its attitude towards
land reforms. Unless the political class of
the country agrees to overhaul the entire
_law of property_ and the property structure,
and writes that overhaul into the Constitution
itself, there is little chance of the
agenda of land reforms being "fulfilled"
except by being discarded.

As the ceiling laws did not meet even
a fraction of the need arising from land-lessness,
the government perforce turned
to distribution of public land to the poor.
All states of India have some policies and
regulations in this regard and have
undertaken distribution of such lands, but
Andhra Pradesh appears to be far and
away the most advanced state in this
regard. Forty-two lakh acres of government
land has been distributed to the
landless poor in this state from about the
1960s. This appears to be more than half
the total amount of such land distributed
in the whole country. Small wonder then
that problems connected with this land
distribution occupy the centre stage of
agitations and discussion concerning the
land question in the state today. Of course
the first issue should have been this shift
of focus away from takeover of excess
land of the rich to the distribution of
mostly barren government land. That the
debate is oblivious of this shows how far
the political priorities have changed from
social justice for the poor to somehow
keeping them alive.

The issues then are that in many cases,
the distribution was only on paper: a piece
of paper indicating the land grant was
given but the recipient was not put in
possession of the land. Indeed, in quite a
few instances there was no clear indication
of the land granted: a survey number
covering a large extent would be shown
on the grant and the extent granted would
be shown as one or two acres (the rule
being a maximum of 2½ acres of wet
land or five acres of dry land), without
showing where it lies in the land. Sometimes
the land granted would already be
encroached on by someone else and they
would refuse to budge. No assistance is
given to the grantee to help get possession
of the land. Most often the land, being
stone and bush filled, would need much
work on it to make it cultivable, and the
government would neither undertake the
task nor provide capital to the grantee to
undertake it. A landless poor person who
has to labour every day in somebody
else's fields to keep the family alive cannot
afford to take time off to clear the
land assigned to him/her of stones and
bushes. And so they have often sold it
cheap to someone who has the capital to
bring it under cultivation. The government
never heeded the demand that if assignment
is to be meaningful, it should improve
the land, make it cultivable, and in rain-scarce
areas provide some water source
too. Finally, there were cases of the powerful
encroaching onto the assigned land by
force and dispossessing the grantee.

The government itself estimates that 10
lakh acres out of the 42 lakhs assigned
have been alienated. The left parties have
alleged that about 20 lakh acres have been
alienated, though the source of their information
is not known. Such alienation
is illegal under the _AP Assigned Lands
(Prohibition of Transfers) Act, 1977_
(popularly known as _Act 9 of 1977_), which
operates with retrospective effect. The Act
works on the beneficent assumption that
if land assigned to the poor has been
alienated by the grantee, it would be only
under pressing circumstances, and therefore
provides for cancelling every transfer
and handing the land back to the grantee
even if he has knowingly sold it. (But if
he sells it again, he will not get it back:
it will revert to the government.) If the
_tehsildars_ who hold the exclusive power
to cancel illegal alienation of assigned land
had acted as they are supposed to under
the law, the 10 lakh acres would not have
remained with the purchasers. They did
not, and illegal transfers of land assigned
to the poor continue to take place, with the
rural elite being the main beneficiaries.

# Transgressions

The lid was blown off this issue by the
chief minister Y S Rajasekhara Reddy
himself who confessed some time ago
that his own family had been owning
about 1,000 acres of land assigned to the
poor. He said they had been owning it in
a fit of absent-mindedness for decades
and having woken up belatedly he deemed
it his duty to the law to hand it back to
the government. (He did not however
deem it his duty in law to get arrested
for the wrongful occupation, for such a
transgression is a penal offence carrying
a six-month jail sentence.) In fact, he had
created some kind of a garden known as
the Idupulapaya estate in the land, with
varieties of trees watered by a stream
flowing nearby. He was known to retire,
now and then, to this estate and it was
public knowledge in his native district of
Cuddapah that his family had grabbed it
from the poor, but nobody had spoken out
because of obvious reasons. Why he chose
to confess to his offence is not known but
there must be a good enough reason for he
is not known to bow to the law, in time
or belatedly. What is true is that (even)
1,000 acres of rural land in a rain-scarce
district like Cuddapah is nothing for him,
for he has been known to have plenty of
much more solid property in urban India.

The government thereupon declared its
intention to apply _Act 9 of 1977_ strictly
to all alienated assigned land and cancel
every transfer. It would have been the
simplest thing, as the _Ranga Rao Committee_
noted, for every _tehsil_ office has
the record of assignments made and every
village cultivation account shows the name
of the person in actual possession of
every bit of land. All that was needed
was to make this information public and
appoint special _tehsildars_ to take up the
cases, cancel all the transfers and restore
the land to the original grantee. The
government did no such thing, but instead
made an amendment to the _Act 9 of 1977_.
The amendment says that after cancelling
the transfer the _tehsildar_ is not required to
give the land back to the original grantee
if the area has been notified for this purpose
"in public interest and for a public
purpose". In such areas the wrongfully
alienated land will go back to the government
instead of the original grantee.

This was a clever ploy. The government
itself knows that about one-fourth of the
land assigned to the poor has been alienated,
and its opponents say that one-half
has been. So by issuing notifications
under the amended _Act 9 of 1977_, it takes
the land back to be given to some enterprise
or the other, or some _special economic
zone_. It means that so much land goes for
ever out of the reach of the poor in general,
and not merely from the original grantee
of the land. The whole exercise begun in
the name of safeguarding the interests of
the landless poor assignees of government
land then turns out to be for the dubious
purpose of getting back as much of the
assigned land as possible into the hold of
the government, to be put to use for
higher purposes. In addition to this amendment,
Y S Rajasekhara Reddy has often
declared contrary to the law that if the
purchaser from the assignee is a small
farmer, then the transfer will not be annulled
but the land will be settled with
the purchaser. But who will not turn out
to be small farmer in such enquiries? Thus
the land-grabbers will get an opportunity
to whitewash their offence and the government
will get back from one-fourth to
one-half of all the land assigned to the
poor in the past. That all this should be
done in the name of setting right the
wrongs done to land assignment is an
index of how shameless governance can
be in this country.

# Role of the Left Parties

The left parties are demanding the taking
back of these dishonest alterations
(one of which is contrary to the law), but
the government is adamant. The left
parties are leading poor people to occupy
wrongfully alienated lands which the rich
have got possession of. Such occupation
certainly inspires the poor, but whether it
will have any more lasting consequence
than making for good TV visuals --- the
sea of red flags, especially --- needs to be
seen. Except at Mudigonda, the police
have been exhibiting a tolerance which
is very democratic but is uncharacteristic
of the AP Police. The special position of
the _CPI(M)_, especially, which has enough
votes to make a difference in a close
contest in a few districts and has made it
known that in the matter of electoral alliances
it follows no principles (except
that it will not join with the BJP), has
served to kindle hope in Chandrababu Naidu
and cause jitters to Y S Rajasekhara
Reddy, who has evidently instructed the
police not to go beyond token arrests.
Chandrababu Naidu, who during his eightyear
rule began the policy of reserving
public land exclusively for the use of the
rich, has been allowed by the left parties
to pretend that was never so and join the
land struggle. In fact, while Congressmen
never had much genuine love for the poor,
it was in Chandrababu Naidu that one
saw for the first time a chief minister who
would talk of the poor and of poverty
with open contempt. The political opportunism
of the _CPI(M)_ has allowed him
to wipe off the stigma of that arrogance
and pose as a friend of the poor.

But ceiling surplus land and assignable
public land are not the only issues agitating
the villages of Andhra Pradesh. There
are two other categories of land: that
being acquired for industries and _Special
Economic Zones_, and tribal land in the
_scheduled areas_. The former category
accounts for nothing less than two lakh
acres, and probably much more than that
and the latter is a tragedy all by itself,
dealt with quite elaborately but still inadequately
by the _Ranga Rao Committee_.
Villages across the state are agitated by
these issues, but they require separate
treatment, both for reasons of space and
because they are not central to the left
parties' agitation, being often the subject
of agitation by smaller groups or the
affected people themselves. Yet each one
of them could lead to a Nandigram some
day.
