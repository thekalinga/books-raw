_There is a palpable tension in the incongruity between the present
_times_, as defined by the World Bank and expectations of social and
economic democracy buttressed by the possibilities afforded by
political democracy in India. The likes of the crafty Chandrababu, of
whom there are quite a few in Indian politics and public life, are in
search of ways of overcoming the tension to the advantage of their
viewpoint. Will they succeed, and if so on what terms; if not, which of
the two mutually incongrous terms will prevail are questions for the
immediate future._

\

Do the _times_, so to speak, choose the
right person, or does the right person latch
on to the right _times_, is a hard question
for a materialism that will not be vulgar;
if it is at all necessary to use the word
materialism, that is, when mere realism
would perhaps suffice. (The word 'choose'
is still ambiguous; it contains two
meanings: that the processes let loose by
the _times_ shape the person suitably, or
that they pick up the pre-existing person.)

That changed _times_ produce changed
ideas and bring persons holding the ideas
to positions of dominance in the various
spheres of life is a matter of common
experience, and appears to demonstrate
decisively the simple proposition that ideas
and their dominance are determined by
'material reality'; though the simple
proposition reveals itself to be rather
complex when one realises that it is a
sociological hypothesis rhetorically
invested with the status of an
epistemological truth. Whichever way one
sees it, a greater complexity is revealed
the moment one tries to define the changed
_times_ minus the changed ideas, to locate
the changed reality at any point prior to
the existence of ideas about it.

But from the point of view of philosophical
humanism the more interesting
and intriguing question is this: since it is
human beings who hold ideas (there being
no other mode of existence of ideas that
we may know of), and they hold them
more or less intelligently, what exactly, in
human terms, is the process by which
ideas appropriate to the _times_ become
dominant in the various spheres of life?
The word dominance here need not
necessarily be understood in a pejorative
sense. It could mean: more often believed,
more widely propagated, more aggressively
expressed, invested with greater
authoritative truth (or, in the alternative,
with greater common sense), supported
more by the state or other powerful forces,
or any combination of these.

If one gives up the language of reification
that makes the entity called the _times_ pick
up the persons to suit its ideological needs,
as rhetorical expression sometimes has it,
there remain two answers. One is that
persons with appropriate ideas (whether
the ideas were there before, or they came
into being in the course of the changes
heralding the new _times_) gravitate to the
foci of power and influence by the action
of some determinate forces let loose by
(or rather, that constitute) the changed
_times_. The other answer would locate the
subjectivity in the persons with the right
ideas, who latch on to the right _times_,
indeed sight them in their incipience and
participate in the process of bringing them
to fruition, for their own purposes, whether
individual or collective, magnanimous or
malign.

The two answers are in truth inseparable,
though whether taken together they add
up to the popular materialist dictum that
_Social being determines Social consciousness_
is a moot question. Indeed that
seemingly illuminating expression, if taken
to express an epistemological statement,
is merely a tautological restatement of the
basic premise of epistemological realism,
that _consciousness_ is nothing other than
_consciousness_ of _being_, which means
that it cannot but be determined by _being_,
provided one is careful enough to add the
rider that this does not mean any straight
forward reflection. Of course, the fundamental
reformulation wrought by humanist
ontology, which need not be and should
not be otherwise inimical to epistemological
realism, that _consciousness_ is not
_consciousness_ of _being_, but _conscious
being_, robs the expression of even the
tautological truth. For the same reason,
one can no more interpret the expression
sociologically, since when both _consciousness_
and _being_ are but notional facets of
_conscious being_, there can be no _social
consciousness_ separate from or subsequent
to _social being_ to be determined by it.

One is then left with the two-sided truth
expressed by the two artificially separated
processes described above. In analysing
changed _times_ and changed ideas, then,
one has to concretely analyse the new
forces that constitute the material or social
(in the sense of social relations rather than
human beings) aspect of the changed
_times_, and the persons with suitable ideas
that the forces bring or push into the foci
of power; and simultaneously, the persons
with suitable ideas who identify changes
(mature or incipient), sometimes perhaps
not changes at all but only minor possibilities,
latch on to them and ride to
positions of power and importance even
as they help bring the changes to fruition
in the same movement. In a given instance
it may well be that a powerful material
force such as the needs of _corporate capitalism_
dominates this two-sided process;
equally, at other times, it may well be true
that a dynamic group of persons, perhaps
--- but not necessarily --- even a definable
fraction of a class or some other sociological
grouping, add with their strong
ideas to an incipient material possibility
the strength that it may not have had to
become the dominant reality. Today, in
the third world, the former is perhaps more
true, to such an extent that it appears to
lend veracity to even crude materialism,
but there is no reason to believe that it must
always be so. It is arguable that the latter
process is a more accurate description of
the initial phase of _left-leaning_ or at least
_welfare-leaning_ policies of most third
world countries, notwithstanding that this
difference has been rendered obscure by
reductionist analysis. But that discussion
is not the present subject.

One conclusion about future prospects
that one may draw from these considerations
is that for a humanist perspective,
there is no such thing as a stable, sure,
socialist phase of history, or a post-history
of humankind, distinguishable in its
eternally reproduced ethos of co-operation
and sharing from a pre-history of mutual
predation as Marx imagined in his more
extravagant moods. There will always be
the possibility of evil surfacing strongly,
taken along and magnified into the
dominant social reality by a determined
bunch of persons, or a whole identifiable
social category, aggrieved for whatever
reason or motivated by a desire for socially
destructive choices dressed up of course
in some grand rhetoric, for human beings
can never be meanly mean, we must be
grandly mean. That we choose, and that
we may choose evil as well as good, is
the fundamental human reality, in whose
modification the only thing that works is
the human moral sense, not an eternal
moral code interior to the species, but the
moral potential, which takes concrete form
in and through the current civilisational
morality that is embodied in the institutions
and norms, the structure and the values,
of that civilisation, which define, enabled
and limit it. Eternal vigilance, it appears,
is the price fo not only liberty but socialism
as well; not vigilance against an external
enemy about which socialist minded people
need not be told afresh for we have worked
it into a paranoid trait at least since
Bolshevik times, but about the human
potential for evil within.

* * *

Chandrababu Naidu, the much lionised
chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, was
very much around before the World Bank
took over the Indian economy. He was
known to be an unprincipled political
manipulator, otherwise described as an
_able_ party manager. His shifty eyes
--- described with accurately defamatory
imagination, and subsequently retracted
for that reason, as the looks of a thief at
a cattle fair by his erstwhile colleague in
the _Telugu Desam Party_ --- member of
parliament Renuka Choudhary --- put off
most people, but his talent at the kind of
politics he chose was recognised and
respected by those who respect such things.
That _corporate capitalism_ would at most
recognise a country cousin in his cut throat
ruthlessness and ability to cohabit easily
with falsehood would perhaps have been
conceded by an observer of those days,
if at all such an observer thought of
_corporate capitalism_ in connection with
such an unlikely creature as Babu, as
Chandrababu Naidu is fondly known to
such people as are fond of him, or wish
to be thought so. But a country cousin is
only a country cousin, and nobody in those
days would have dreamt that he would
become a blue-eyed boy of _corporate
capitalism_ one day.

His capacity to amass property at
remarkable speed, otherwise described as
'entrepreneurial ability' or 'business acumen',
was also known, and again respected by
those who respect such things. He was
after all born to a father who had but four
acres of rain-fed land in a part of
Rayalaseema where much of the land is
rain-fed, that is when there is rain at all to
feed it, but according to his own recent
'declaration of assets' he owns property
worth Rs 4 crore now. One is at liberty
to multiply that figure by such factor as
appeals to one's imagination, for he is no
stickler for facts, and indeed it has been
a favourite pastime of Congressmen over
here ever since he made the declaration
to guess at the right factor, and they have
been coming up with a new number each
day, more for their amusement than
anybody's edification. But even four crore
from four acres of dry land in a not
particularly fertile region --- and that too
shared among brothers --- is an achievement
that tells quite a lot about the man and his
scruples. And yet nobody dreamt in those
days that he would be talked about in the
business capitals of the world, as we are
told is happening now. Though, that
perhaps merely shows that, influenced by
the smooth and suave face of _corporate
capitalism_, we do not often realise the
strong affinity it has to the recognisably
repulsive rural buccaneer.

He habitually speaks, whether in the
assembly or outside, in the terse and
preremptory tones of a village bully, accompanied
by the shaking of a threatening
forefinger. That is perhaps put down to
unease in speaking English when he is
seen on TV by outsiders, but no, it is his
manner of speech, which reflects a
personality trait formed perhaps quite early
in his youth from his upper caste lower
middle class background, which meant he
was one among the boys in the village,
the school or the college, not alienated and
set apart as a rich one would have been,
but one of the boys and a natural leader
by virtue of his caste, entitled to bully the
boys around. It is not that the background
automatically makes one a bully, but it
gives the opportunity, and some of those
given the opportunity choose. The same
background gives other opportunities too,
and some may elect those. Moreover, the
opportunity is not presented from outside
but is refracted through the particular
personality. We are here close to the point
where our explanation can no longer be
merely social; it must necessarily also be
moral and psychic. And after a while all
explanation ceases and we can only record,
though we can always dig a little more and
try to explain a little more.

What human beings make, and what
makes human beings are the two sides of
the intertwined process of history. The
first is observable, even if the authorship
is often obscure and frequently contested,
but the second can only be inferred or
guessed at. All attempts to discover that
which, in the first or final analysis, makes
human beings, are bound to be futile
because at the end it will always be qualified
by the statement that firstly what makes
me is refracted through the unique thing
called _I_, and secondly by the fact that _I_
_choose_. This applies not merely to external
determinants such as production relations
or class situation, but even the subjective
determinant of productive human practice
which is frequently set up as an adequate
alternative to objective determinism, for
it can no more completely explain human
choice which belongs to the psychic and
moral dimensions of human existence as
much as its practical dimension. A fuller
ontology and a fuller anthropology than
that of human practice is needed for that.
Radical thinkers appear to baulk here
because it would go against the utopian
hopes about human possibilities that are
the mainstay of radicalism, though a fuller
humanism need not militate against all
hope of progress, even substantial progress.

But one can legitimately talk of influences
and impacts that have effect on not
only the choices we are faced with, and
indeed the choices we often create for
ourselves, but also our proclivity to make
this choice or that. These influences are
perhaps more useful to explain behaviour
from hindsight than to predict anything,
but even that is helpful for making sense
of ourselves.

The totality of social culture embedded
in the social structure is undoubtedly the
strongest influence, given all the premises
of an unabashed humanism. Chandrababu's
father, as said already, was a poor
--- or let us say, a lower middle class
--- farmer, but he was from a dominant caste,
the caste of _kammas_. The caste was powerful
in the village and the region, but this
family was poor and resource-less. This
class-caste category of poor upper castes,
especially in a rural setting that gives it
a tightly knit character held together by
unrepentantly medieval assumptions of
worth, exhibits certain unpleasant traits all
over the country: _arrogance_ and _insecurity_
born of unfulfilled assumptions of
eminence, leading to either the _bullying
type_ who is a threat to the lower castes,
_the sycophant_ who hangs on to the rich
of his caste inside and outside the village
to bask in the reflected importance, _the
ruthless go-getter_ who tramples on all in
his search for what his caste has promised
but his economic status has denied, or
some combination of these uniformly
uninviting traits. Of course, occasionally
the same milieu has produced leaders of
the poor who have put the _caste-confidence_
that others lack at the service of the struggle
against power that they know only too
closely and are in little awe of. But, the
undeniable possibility of individual choice
apart, any significant tendency in that
direction would perhaps require that the
social culture contains a tradition defined
by the idiom of justice and equality.
Chandrababu's native Chittoor district is
sadly lacking in such a culture. The region
has not been to any significant extent
affected by the communist, rationalist and
reformist movements that had a salutary
influence on the culture of the coastal
Andhra districts to the north-east, in
which it was the _kamma_ peasantry that
participated more vigourously than any
other single caste or community; nor did
Chitoor, in spite of its contiguity with the
Tamil country to the south, partake to any
considerable extent of the _non-brahmin_
self-respect movement that had an equally
salutary influence in those parts, especially
on the upper _sudra_ castes comparable to
the _kammas_ of the Telugu country.

Forsaken by social progress of either the
Marxist or the Periyar-ist variety, the most
likely type of poor _kamma_ youth from the
district was the self-confident but simultaneously
insecure seeker of power and
property, prone to either physical violence
or manipulative ruthlessness, devoid of
any sentiment of sympathy for the poor
and the weak, for he has been there and
has nothing but contempt for those who
remain there, even if they do not have his
advantage of caste, indeed precisely
because the wretches are so wretched that
they do not have the advantage. It is an
easily recognisable type, and a type --- with
all the myraid individual variations not
only of actual worth but also emphasis in
the angularities and degrees of scruples
--- that just suits the needs of a very different
mode of life: _Corporate capitalism_, which
needs just such self-centred and unsentimental
types, the more insecure under the
skin the better, for the more ruthless they
will then be.

But Chandrababu had still to grow up
before he could be the blue-eyed boy of
the corporate world. An overgrown country
brat would not do. He, of course, was not
at the beginning in search of a place in
New York's business magazines, but only
power and money in whichever form and
whatever kind. Today, he is sometimes
described as a computer buff; he is certainly
hooked to information technology, to the
point of holding the unlikely belief that
investment in that area can be the locomotive
for the state's growth. But until
recently his life exhibited no such hi-tech
proclivities. Even if he had been born rich,
he would in all probability have moved
into the lucrative world of civil contracts
rather than information technology, and
then perhaps moved to politics from there,
like the average Indian rural-based
politician. As he was born poor, he had
neither that option nor this; he could only
enter politics.

He cut his teeth in campus politics in
the small town university at Tirupati, at
the foothills of Lord Venkateswara. The
university was (and still is) dominated by
caste groupings of the dominant communities,
overlaid with the proneness to
factional violence characteristic of some
of the hinterland areas of the university,
such as Cuddapah district. Physical
violence was not Chandrababu's forte. It
pays little, and has an uncomfortably
terminal character. He preferred to
manoeuvre and manipulate from behind
the scenes most of the time. Being a _kamma_
helped him a lot. The _kammas_ of
Rayalaseema, unlike their cousins of the
central coastal districts, have to contend
with an equally strong, but numerically
larger and violently inclined caste --- the
_Reddys_. Yet, being second to none in the
_non-brahmin_ hierarchy, and in their self-perception
more competent in any sphere
of life than any, the _kammas_ of
Rayalaseema see no reason why they
should play second fiddle to the _reddys_.
And therefore any capable leader from
that community would attract following.
Other _non-reddy_ castes would also be
inclined to follow such a leader. Both at
the university and later outside the campus,
Chandrababu used this advantage to the
hilt. But he also used the image of an
educated young man (he took an MA in
Economics and apparently dabbled a bit
in research of some sort before going on
to higher things) as a foil to the old fogeys
of the _reddy_ caste who till then dominated
the district's politics.

A dynamic, educated young man to
some and a _kamma_ leader to others, he
rose fast in the politics of the district. Such
of his friends as went behind him pulled
by the idealism attached to the image of
an educated modern young man fighting
medieval fogeys cannot to this day forget
the shock they received when they saw
him making money from day one after he
became MLA. He has never looked back
after that. Some politicians are credited
with some idealism in the initial years
of their career, which they outgrow in due
course and recall nostalgically on
inebriated evenings thereafter.
Chandrababu has never been accused of
any such weakness.

# VISION OF PROGRESS

But it cannot be said that he did not have
a long-term vision for the kind of society
he wanted this country to be. He did, and
that is what makes him more than a
_ha'penny politician_. Indeed, we would not
be discussing him otherwise. That vision,
predictably, was made up of notions of a
high growth rate, technological modernity,
unsentimental efficiency and other notions
that typically hang together. He was
recognisably impatient with anything that
was an obstacle to this; in particular, like
all persons who hold the arrogant belief
that they are 'self-made', as the expression
goes, he was impatient with claims of
social disadvantage or structural disabilities.
Such people had only themselves
to blame, really.

This type, of both person and point of
view, is quite familiar. It is easily
attributable to capitalism, though such
persons and such a point of view exist in
all societies, as will be evident if one is
not taken in too much by the notion that
certain classes of ideas and certain types
of personalities are exclusive to certain
societies. But the type is no doubt found
more in societies that are capitalist in their
economic structure, for that system of
production encourages such a viewpoint,
and persons whose personality is permeated
with that viewpoint. (That ideas are not
held in the mind but through the personality
is one of the great truths of psychoanalysis,
which makes it inescapable that any
epistemological discussion is really an
exploration in the anthropology of ideas,
and hence also that any theory of history
must be humanist if it is to even begin to
be true.)

What is interesting about Indian society
is the way this viewpoint has risen to
ascendance in society in the last decade
or so. But, in hindsight, it appears that this
ascendance, as far as Andhra Pradesh is
concerned, was signified at least in part
by the rise of the _Telugu Desam Party_
(TDP). Impatience with the emphasis on
welfare and concern for the disadvantaged
that early on characterised the Indian polity
shaped by the expectations of the social
and political churning that we call the
_freedom struggle_, is an attitude that has
been hardening over the years in Indian
society. The more that the hitherto disadvantaged
assert themselves and demand
changes in society, policy and the law, the
more the resentment grows, and the more
the impatience for jettisoning it grows.
Much of recent Indian political history can
be interpreted within these terms. The
theoretical crisis of socialism and the
downfall of the states called _socialist_ has
further philosophically emboldened this
impatience, as much as the fact that the
economic policies of yore found it difficult
to cross a certain limit of growth.

It is not that there was no space within
the Congress Party for this impatience;
there was plenty. But a certain inertia is
inevitable in any organisation as old as the
Congress, and moreover there were too
many in that party who had made a political
career of representing the disadvantaged.
Those who were impatient for change were
too impatient to wait. Later in the day, the
rise to popularity of the _Bharatiya Janata
Party_ would signify the same change on
a larger and much more destructive scale,
but as far as Andhra Pradesh is concerned,
it began as far back as 1982, with the birth
of the TDP. The fact was most clearly
represented by _Eenadu_, the daily newspaper
that truly represents the ethos of the social
sections whose impatience led to the
formation of the TDP. Chandrababu, the
manager (formally known as general
secretary) of the party after he got over
his initial hesitation and joined his father-in-law's
party (he was already a Congress
minister by the time N T Rama Rao set
up the TDP) also shared the ethos, though
he did not let anyone perceive him as
anything other than a (very able) party
manager, not even letting people see his
political ambition, until he decided to take
charge of the party to save it from its
founder who, in his estimate, had turned
senile. But even at this stage the time was
not thought ripe to come out, with the no-holds-barred
philosophy of glorification
of _corporate capitalism_, and denigration
of welfarist responsibilities of the state
that characterise the policy dimension of
the Indian Constitution as much as popular
expectations.

The paradoxical situation of this section
of society was that they needed a
charismatic leader to put their interests in
power, but wanted the leader to eschew
the 'populism' --- wasteful and inefficient
--- that gave him the charisma, and be a hard-headed
businessman-chief minister, of the
type that Chandrababu now proudly
declares himself to be. Such perfection not
being attainable by mere human beings,
they perforce had to put up with N T Rama
Rao, his populism (grandiose self-image
of a benevolent provider, in truth) and all.
However, the growing impatience of
_Eenadu_ --- the mouth-piece of this viewpoint
--- with the antics of N T Rama Rao, even
as it steadfastly supported him against the
Congress, reflects the tension inherent in
this paradox quite well.

It is needless to go into the details of
the methods by which this paradox was
sought to be resolved, and the role played
in this by matters like N T Rama Rao's
infatuation with his second wife. (It is not
clear that one can describe these matters
as incidental or contingent, for that may
be a hasty and untenable rationalisation
of the change.) What played a crucial role
in the removal of the inefficient drag on
the economy --- deadwood literally --- that the
founder's ego-centric self-image as the
grand provider of succour to the masses
was by now perceived to have become,
not only by the Family but by the crucial
support base and international policy
prescribers as well, was the bold decision
of Chandrababu to step in as the replacement,
to be the _man_ of the _times_. The _state
shall not be the provider but only a facilitator_,
says the current ruling dogma. To
realise itself, the dogma had to await the
arrival of a determined _facilitator_ to replace
the _grand provider_. The _times_ had to wait
for the _man_. The _man_ with a personality
shaped in an appropriate milieu, imbued
with appropriate values to guide his
choices, and the right kind of personal
scruples or the lack thereof.

That is now in the past. The supporters,
the advisors and the prescribers are all
vocally delighted with the replacement of
the charismatic but unwanted populism of
the founder of the party with the hard
headed pragmatism of his son-in-law who
has assumed the electorally risky self-image
of an unsentimental corporate
executive. The transformation has evoked
expressions of an almost childlike glee
from the executives of the World Bank
and the likes of Bill Gates. And also, one
is told, the business organisations and
magazines that belong there. Chandrababu
knows this, and never tires of declaring
that he is nothing but an efficient manager
of the affairs of the state in the manner
of a company executive. That is not what
the people expect from an elected government
in this country, nor what the Constitution
says it should be, but then the _times_
we live in have little respect for such
backward notions. What remains to be
seen is whether Chandrababu will turn out
to have been in truth the _dupe_ of the
_times_. For India, luckily for the people,
is still a democracy, whatever its considerable
warts, and you cannot be the _man_ of
the _times_ unless you get enough votes.
There are, of course, numerous ways of
managing votes, and Chandrababu knows
all of them. He has indeed been a professional
in the matter for many years, now
aided by computers. But elections still
have a way of taking the most crafty by
surprise. It is not that there is some superior
wisdom in the 'people' as editorial writers
invariably say at the end of each election,
in wholesale expiation of everybody's sins,
but various dissatisfactions and expectations
in society add up often to a sum not
bargained for by the most perfidious
manager of elections, notwithstanding all
the money, the liquor and the physical
threats expended.

Chandrababu, however, is not unaware
of this. He knows there is much he has
to compensate for in the matter of lost
popularity. Relaxation of prohibition on
Indian Made Foreign Liquor, reduction in
the subsidy given to the cheap rice scheme
and power supplied to farmers, and a
ruthlessly determined closure of a number
of loss-making public sector and cooperative
sector industries, unmindful of
viable proposals of revival, have certainly
earned the resentment of a sizeable section
of the population. One cannot, however,
add up the numbers and debit the votes,
because the argument that the schemes
meant for the welfare of a few have
rendered the economy bankrupt wins by
playing upon common human feelings of
guilt, and has been used with considerable
success by dint of tireless insistence by
governmental spokesmen as well as
editorial writers in newspapers; and in any
case there is a tendency among the people
to see welfare, not as the rightful due of
those who are rendered disadvantaged by
unequal social and economic conditions,
but as munificence, transient as all charity.
It has been repeatedly said, and dinned
into the minds of the beneficiaries, that
welfare schemes are concessions given to
the unreasonable blackmail of the
underprivileged, against the common sense
of economic reason. The guilt thus induced
is the surest weapon against any opposition
to the withdrawal of welfare. But all said
and done, the fear of reduced popularity
is there in Chandrababu's mind. That has
set him on the search for a public image
pleasing to the voters.

He is indulging in a series of activities
and policies to this end that are meant to
generate popularity, but are distinguished
from the populism that politicians of his
father-in-law's generation were accustomed
to. It is not just that he needs
to restore his popularity after having started
the dismantling of welfare schemes. There
is a bigger need of the _times_ involved,
and that is what makes it relevant to our
purpose: how does the leader in the image
of a corporate executive establish hold on
popular imagination? To abide by the
farmework set by the dogma that the '_state
should be facilitator and not provider_',
and at the same time overcome the handicap
of invisibility that a mere _facilitator_ would
suffer from, which could be fatal in the
electoral arena, Chandrababu has proposed
the model of an _activist facilitator_. It is
described as _taking governance to the
people_, but it is more of taking himself,
or rather his image, to the people. Taking
governance to the people can only mean
greater decentralisation of governance, but
what Chandrababu is doing in fact is in
a sense greater centralisation, for his brand
of _administrative activism_ concentrates
the image of governance in one person
--- himself. If taking governance to the people
is what he actually wanted, the least he
could have done is to give honest expression
to the spirit of the 73 and 74 Constitution
amendments. But his programmes,
on the contrary, barring only the
water users associations set up by statute
and empowered to participate in the
management of local irrigation systems,
side-step the local bodies completely and
set up the chief minister and his party at
the centre.

His partymen are also making a lot of
money in the process, because Chandrababu's
_activist governance_ has involved
giving rural works contracts under the
_Janmabhoomi_ programme on an informal
basis --- on the plea of encouraging the
'people' to undertake their own development
--- but while Congressmen are crying
hoarse about this because it affects their
own money-making opportunities, what is
more significant about the exercise is the
search being made by Chandrababu for a
vote-gathering replacement, suitable to the
changed _times_, for that much derided
thing called 'populism'. That may come
in use to Congressmen, too, in the days
to come.

There is nothing _per se_ wrong in the
government encouraging _self-help_. If the
chief minister wishes to go around
encouraging the people to clean their streets
and repair the damaged compound wall
of the _gram panchayat_ office or village
school, himself holding a helpful broom
or spade till the TV cameras leave; or if,
as in the _Janmabhoomi_ programme,
villagers are encouraged to pool resources
for local works to the tune of 50 per cent
of the cost in the case of small works, and
30 per cent in the case of big works, with
the government undertaking to supply the
remainder; there is no reason to carp about
it merely because it may make Chandrababu
more popular, or merely because in some
places, in the guise of the "people's
contribution", some local TDP contractor
comes forward and puts up the "people's
share" and makes a neat profit out of the
whole thing. The criticism of all the
political formations in the state, from the
Congress to the extreme left, that all this
is a popularity gimmick, is besides the
point. Being in politics, he wants to be
popular, like all of them. And so long as
he does not do positively harmful things
for becoming popular --- such as pulling
down other people's places of worship
--- there is no point is carping about the desire
for popularity as such. A truer criticism
would be that the activities are actually
resulting in greater centralisation of
governance; and a truer warning to the
people would be that this activity is
intended as a substitute for the welfare
responsibilities of the state, which are
being gradually given up as a matter of
policy. It is not that whatever benefit or
use the people get from Chandrababu's
schemes is necessarily illusory or only
beneficial to the rich. That is not the case.
It is that welfare --- however meagre --- has
always meant at least a minimal redistribution
of resources. _Facilitation_, even the
_activist facilitation_ of Chandrababu, means
on the other hand help rendered on the
basis of the existing distribution of
resources whose inviolability is the holy
cow of today's ruling development
philosophy. Since the welfare structure is
not yet totally disbanded, this distinction
is not yet apparent, but it will soon be. It
is not the case that such a facilitation on
the basis of existing distribution of
resources benefits only the well to do. That
too is not the case, and therefore such
facilitation need not at all be uniformly
unpopular. Nevertheless there is a
qualitative difference in the change of
emphasis from welfare as some minimal
redistribution of resources to _facilitation_
as help given on the basis of whatever
resources you have.

For instance, if there are irrigation
sources in your village and you are a user
(not necessarily a big user), you can
participate in their management through
the water users association; but if you have
no irrigation water available for your use
and you wish to sink a borewell so that
you may turn your dry strip into wet land,
but are too poor to pay the electricity
charges at full cost and therefore expect
the government to supply electricity cheap,
then the answer you get is: nothing doing.
The fact that in the last few decades
irrigation in Andhra Pradesh has grown
mainly because of well water expansion
aided by cheap power, and that this has
given two square meals a day and perhaps
a little besides to lakhs of lower middle
class farming families in the Telangana
and Rayalaseema regions (precisely the
kind of families that Chandrababu's used
to be about four or even three decades
ago), and that not only is the new power
policy that _the user pays all_ going to put
an abrupt end to this expansion, but there
may in fact be a retardation, with wet lands
going dry because many present users
cannot afford to pay the full cost charges,
is evidently a matter of no concern to the
prescribers of policy. This is not an
argument for endless supply of very cheap
power to all rural users. There could be
a gradation of prices. But a general
philosophical assumption that resources
will be efficiently utilised only when the
user pays the cost is a different thing
altogether.

Notwithstanding the difference,
Chandrababu is gambling on whatever
popularity the _facilitative activism_ is likely
to bring him. Another gambit he is boldly
trying out is to contrast his own seeming
dynamism in hopping from village to
village and town to town inspecting the
dusty insides of dilapidated revenue record
rooms or testing the strength of a tank
bund that probably last saw repair before
the sun set on the British empire, with the
proverbial inertia of civil servants. The
gambit has made him unpopular with civil
servants, but quite popular with the people.
Most of his programmes involve the
officials visiting villages in the company
of MLAs and ministers and holding
themselves open to complaints and questions
from the people in the censorious
presence of the legislators who successfully
act as if they are in no way responsbile
for the state of affairs. This is one sure
way of becoming popular in a country like
India where the average civil servant is
rarely available even for supplication, let
alone complaint or criticism. This is
perhaps one thing Chandrababu has learnt
from his father-in-law who put to the best
populist use the resentment common
people have for the officialdom. He
managed to make people forget that politicians
are as much responsible for the
kind of civil service we have in the country.
And the son-in-law has taken the cue quite
well.

There is palpable tension in the incongruity
between the present _times_ as
defined by the World Bank and other
policy prescribers for the third world, and
expectations of social and economic
democracy buttressed by the possibilities
afforded by political democracy in India.
The likes of the crafty Chandrababu, of
whom there are quite a few in Indian
politics and public life, are on the search
for ways of overcoming the tension to the
advantage of their viewpoint. Will they
succeed, and if so on what terms, with
what sort of a redefinition of democracy;
and if not, which of the two mutually
incongruous terms will prevail to what
extent, or what kind of a cancerous body
politic will be left behind, are questions
for the immediate future. Not questions
for contemplation, but positive action.
