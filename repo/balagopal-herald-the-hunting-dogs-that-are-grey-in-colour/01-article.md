_Eighteen 'naxalites' have been killed in 15 'encounters' in Andhra
Pradesh this year till the end of June And now the state government
has announced its decision to constitute an 'elite corps' of
police --- a force of some 1,000, to be called 'Greyhounds' --- to fight
the 'naxalites'. The consequences of this creation, if it ever takes
place and is let loose in the villages and the forest areas, can be
imagined._

May 1988 has been an eventful month for
NTR's government and his _Telugu Desam_
party. The 6th annual convention of the
party --- called _Mahanadu_ by its obsessively
tradition-conscious founder --- was held on
the banks of the Krishna river from May
22 to 28. Heritage is perhaps a better word
than tradition, for it is not so much the
ritual form as the burden of _parampara_
that weighs upon NTR . He sees himself
as one who is carrying forward the
heritage of all the kings who ruled over
the Telugu people during the last two
thousand years. The institutions of the
polity, of the administration and of his
party are conceptualised and named after
the institutions of old. But of course there
is always the farcical element that is inevitable
when history is forcibly made to
repeat itself.

The word _Mahanadu_ according to
historians of the Chola period of south
Indian history, stood for both a territory,
and the periodic assembly of the dominant
landed gentry of the territory. The
gentry used to gather in an assembly
--- the _Mahanadu_ --- once in a while to decide
upon issues connected with the expenditure
of the surplus extracted from the
subordinate cultivators; and land grants
to brahmins, temple construction, water
courses, distribution of cultivable wastes
among aspiring cultivator?., etc. At a
period of history when the centralisation
of authority in the kingdom was weak, it
was these assemblies of the landed gentry
that dispensed with people's lives and happiness.
That NTR chooses to call the annual
assembly of his party _Mahanadu_ is
probably an unwitting piece of symbolism,
but is very apt-nevertheless.

However --- and here the symbolism
turns farcical --- we are no longer living in
a period of weak centralisation. The King
is now an all-powerful man and it is he
who dispenses with people's lives and happiness,
or about as much of it as he can
with a landlord-contractor-trader class as
his social base and a budget that is just
about twice the size of the annual deficit
in the union government's budget. And so,
while the _Mahanadu_ of old was not only
a powerful body but also a corporate entity,
the _Mahanadu_ of NTR is a silly
caricature. It is more a fair than a party
congress. The assemblage spent much of
the week-long session watching cockfights,
bullock-cart races and assorted
rural games; seeing NTR's films as well
as what are called 'folk' cultural programmes
from 8 am till 12 noon each day in
improvised theatres, of which there were
as many as six; trying their hand at competitions
in _rangoli_ (for women), eating
_idlis_ and carrying grain bags on the back
(for men), running races (for both sexes)
and archery (for boys); amusing themselves
at the miniature zoo made up of a
tiger, a lion, a bear, a stag and a few other
animals brought from the Hyderabad zoo;
and acquiring merit in the meanwhile by
touching NTR's feet if and when possible.
The venue for the fair was on the banks
of the Krishna river, at the border of the
Krishna and Guntur districts. It was named
Satavahanapuram, following the common
historiography of Telugu nationalism
which considers the Satavahanas as the
first Telugu kings, though it is not clear
what, if anything at all, was Telugu about
them. The administrative machinery of
the Krishna and Guntur districts was
mobilised on a large scale to equip
Satavahanapuram with conveniences such
as 3,000 electric lights of various kinds,
two transformers and three emergency
generators to light them with, 360 taps to
provide water to human beings and cattle,
a hundred toilets, six theatres, a stadium
for games, a miniature zoo, umpteen arches
and stalls and approach roads, and
thatched huts built in accordance with
traditional _vastu_ principles for the leaders
to rest and reside in. The departments of
electricity, roads and buildings, public
health, water works, civil supplies and the
police were mobilised in their entirety for
this purpose. The collector of Guntur
district, a young man by name Jannat
Hussain who is known for his irascible
temper which is directed impartially
towards both the people and the politicians,
was disinclined to force his administration
into all this activity which
was no part of its duty. He was promptly
transferred.

About the only serious thing the delegates
did during the week-long assembly
was to squabble over the nominations of
office-bearers of the party and its mass
organisations. But even this squabbling
was within the limits of the legitimate: it
was followers of the two sons-in-law that
quarrelled, and both of them in the name
of the father-in-law. The latter, however,
has displayed an uncanny ability in playing
the two factions one against the other,
an ability that the late Indira Gandhi
would herself have complimented for its
dexterity. For a long time the younger one,
Chandrababu Naidu, then general secretary
of the party, appeared to have a firm
lead over the elder, Venkateswara Rao,
who was only president of the youth wing.
But suddenly the former is deprived of his
post and the latter is made health minister.
But before any conclusion can be drawn
from this change, Chandrababu Naidu is
back to prominence, nominated chairman
of the _Karshaka Parishad_, a 'farmers
body' floated by the government, which
is likely to become a significant creation
of NTR's reign. Congressmen have expressed
resentment that this body which
has official status and is likely to be handed
over the running of various agricultural
and marketing institutions and schemes,
is at the same time being run as if it is the
farmers' wing of the ruling party. A Congressman
has even approached the High
Court against the nomination of the chief
minister's son-in-law for the chairman's
post, and the High Court has stayed any
extension of his term beyond six months.
Their fear is understandable, in the context
of the rapid consolidation of the
dominant landed classes, and the need
that every party feels to find a constituency
for itself within this consolidation.
NTR had a head start in this matter from
the very beginning, and the _Karshaka
Parishad_ can be a significant leap forward,
unless he makes a hash of it as he
is apt to.

All this really fits in well with the running
of the party's annual congress in the
manner of a village fair presided over by
the benign gentry. The comedy, however,
was relieved by a fear that haunted the
_Telugu Desam_ leaders throughout that
week. It was the fear that the _naxalites_
would attack the gathering and kill the
leaders. The fear was given substance by
the incredible security arrangements made
at public expense for the personal safety
of the _Telugu Desam_ leaders. On the day
of the final public meeting on May 28, the
security was provided by 6,000 police personnel,
including two officers of the rank
of DIG, 25 superintendents of police and
assistant SPs, 50 deputy superintendents
of police, 140 inspectors and 450 sub-inspectors.
One does not know whether
this list is confined to the visible
policemen, i e, the khakhi-clad variety, or
it also includes the invisible armed men
of the anti-_naxalite_ squads. The reason
shown for this heavy security was the
retaliatory violence indulged in by the
CPI(ML) (_People's War_) group after a
young but prominent leader of theirs,
Daggu Rajalingam, was killed in an 'encounter'
at Warangal on May 11. The
police broke open the door of a house in
which he was staying and killed him as
well as the householder, Santosh Reddy.
His party indulged in widespread arson
in protest against this killing . They burnt
down dozens of RTC buses, a few _tahsil_
offices, railway stations, microwave stations
and even a telephone exchange.
Though up to that time --- and even afterwards
for that matter --- their targets had
been marked by the quality of being
inanimate (when the buses were burnt the
passengers were asked to get down, and
in quite a few cases a touching flourish
was added by distributing all the money
in the conductor's bag adoring the
passengers), the _Telugu Desam_ leaders
were not sure that would remain so forever.

And hence the security. Yet it is strange
that the police did not desist from 'encounter'
killings at least for the duration
of the _Mahanadu_, lest the situation get
aggravated. On the contrary, five persons
were killed in four 'encounters' during the
_Mahanadu_ week, even as apprehension
was repeatedly being expressed of a _naxalite_
plot of retaliation. One should infer
either that the apprehensions were put on
for public consumption or that the free
hand given to the police in NTR's rule is
so Free that it does not care for the convenience
of the donor. Going by the
evidence on hand one is tempted to draw
the latter conclusion.

18 persons have been killed in 15 'encounters'
this year, till the end of June.
17 of them belong to the _People's War_
group and one,a youth by name Sahadev
Reddy of Sirsilla, to the CPI(ML) group
identified by the name of the late
C P Reddy. The boy was picked up by the
police on May 25, tortured severely during
that day, and killed. It was announced
that there was an 'encounter' on May 26
at the village of Dharmaram where the
'extremists' tried to set on fire the Tendu
leaves being procured by the forest department,
and Sahadev Reddy died in that 'encounter'. Students
who demonstrated later
at Hyderabad against this killing were
lathi-charged and dispersed. The stories
of the remaining 17 deaths are variations
on the same theme. Some were picked up,
tortured and killed, some were confronted
in an inconvenient position --- sitting or
sleeping in the open --- and killed instantly,
some were killed while running away, and
some were trapped in houses behind
closed doors which were broken open as
in Rajalingam's case.

And there were a few persons --- at least
three as far as we know --- who were tortured
brutally and killed and even an 'encounter'
was not announced. One was a
Lambada youth by name Meghya of
Mustyalapalli in Warangal district; he was
picked up during December 1987 and tortured
for a long period in detention. His
father met the superintendent of police
and petitioned for his son's safety. On
January 23 the boy died, and the police
hanged the dead body with his own shirt
from an electric transformer in the middle
of Warangal town. They let the body hang
there as a public threat for more than 12
hours before taking it down and announcing
that some unfortunate youth had
committed suicide in a most novel
fashion. When the boy's father met the SP
again the gentleman told him : "We have
sent your Meghya to the clouds (_Megh_)".
The second was Bhikshapati, also of
Warangal district, whom the CPI claimed
as their activist. The police, however,
claimed that he was an 'extremist'; he was
also picked up at the end of last
December, and a few weeks later his dead
body with its face chopped out of recognition
was discovered in a shallow well. The
third was Rajender, a one-time activist of
the _People's War_ group. He was picked-up
by the police of Peddapalli and a few days
later his dead body was found in the fields
outside his village.

Naturally, therefore, the _Telugu Desam_
leaders had cause to fear an attack during
_Mahanadu_, The press also pestered them
to announce their policy for tackling the
_naxalite_ 'menace' as it is called. Since the
leaders of our country have not yet learnt
to tell the press,that they do not have a
policy when they do not have one, there
were random pronouncements during that
week from the chief minister, the home
minister, the chief secretary and the director
general of police. The stated content
of the policy varied from person to person,
depending upon how much need each felt
to be populist and how much each could
afford to be populist. NTR, who refuses
mulishly to acknowledge that he made a
mistake during his innocent first days in
calling the _naxalites_ patriots and asking
them to join him in his effort to capture
the _Lal Qila_, continued to say that he
would invite them for talks; the home
minister, however, clarified that the invitation
would not be extended to the _People's
War_ group but only to the other groups;
his own inclination, however, was against
any talks with any of them, for he said
simultaneously that all of them would be
wiped out in a year's time; the officials,
for their part, would say nothing about
the talks but reiterated their decision to
ask for more sophisticated weapons and
gadgets: there was talk of giving commando
training to the police, equipping them
with vehicles and wireless sets worth 2.5
_crore_ rupees, requesting the centre to send
some more CRPF forces, and to give permission
to the police to use grenades. Buta
Singh, who visited Hyderabad in this
period for the meeting of the Southern
Zonal Council, promised help without
committing himself to anything in particular.
The police officials also talked
cryptically of 'a well-knit strategy' and a
'co-ordinated plan', whose details, of
course, could not be divulged.

But there was one concrete decision that
was churned up from all this confusion.
This was the decision that an 'elite corps
of police' would be formed to fight the
_naxalites_. A force of 1,000 --- an oversized
battalion --- would be constituted and
would be named 'Greyhounds'. This was
announced on June 6 and was widely
publicised in the press. The Telugu press
quite unnecessarily rendered the breed
name into Telugu with the unseemly translation
'hunting dogs that are grey in
colour', one of them going to the extent
of inventing the Sanskritised title
_Dhusravarna Jagilam_. The police
themselves would not have found this very
amusing, since 'dog' is the common abuse
that militant political activists have always
used to describe policemen. However, they
will probably take comfort from the promise
that " ... this elite force is to be
equipped with modern weapons, bulletproof
jackets and other special equipments",
as an official press release puts
it. The consequences of this creation, if
it ever takes place and is let loose in the
villages and the forest areas, can be
imagined.
