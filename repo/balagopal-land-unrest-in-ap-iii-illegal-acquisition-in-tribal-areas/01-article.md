_The story of illegal land acquisition from _scheduled areas_ in
Andhra Pradesh inhabited by tribals points to judicial apathy,
bureaucrat connivance and governmental inaction. Cases such as
the Polavaram project in Khammam district and the bauxite mining
projects show that laws and rules are merrily flouted. It is no
wonder that protests are on the rise. This is the third and final part
in the series._

\ 

The tribal areas of Andhra Pradesh
present a disheartening picture:
events are fast overtaking the
_adivasis_, and there is no concerted effort
to oppose them. Land and the produce
of the forest remain their main source of
livelihood, but availability of land is
restricted by forest reservation on the one
hand and _non-tribal_ encroachment on the
other. They cannot move out of the forests
and seek livelihood in the strange
and --- it often seems to them --- hostile
society of the plains. Where they do, they
are exploited ruthlessly by the plains-people.
In the forests, their struggle to
increase their livelihood opportunities
calls up clashes with the forest department
and the _non-tribals_.

Over the years a precarious balance has
been struck in the matter, thanks to the
assistance the _adivasis_ have received from
a variety of political forces, the _Naxalites_
in particular, and social activists, but the
balance is ruptured harshly when the
government steps in with proposals of
forest-based projects. The Polavaram dam
on the Godavari river, which will submerge
upwards of 270 villages, all of them
located in the _scheduled area_ of Khammam,
East and West Godavari districts,
and the bauxite mining project in the
tribal area of Visakhapatnam district,
which will displace many more tribal
hamlets than the government's plan would
admit, are the focus of considerable
tribal unrest. Before that, a mention needs
to be made about unrest related to _non-tribal_
encroachment on to tribal land, an
unrest that has taken severe form from
the early 1990s.

Andhra Pradesh has a _scheduled area_
in nine districts, and perhaps the most
stringent law prohibiting alienation of
tribal land to _non-tribals_. Not only are
_non-tribals_ prohibited from purchasing
tribal land, they cannot (ever since the
regulation 1 of 1970 was promulgated on
February 3, 1970) purchase land even
from a _non-tribal_. The law presumes that
all land in the _scheduled areas_ originally
belonged to the _scheduled tribes_. If a
_non-tribal_ has got possession of it before
there was any prohibition, or with the
consent of the agent to the government
when purchase with such consent was
permitted prior to 1970, he cannot be
disturbed. But when he wants to sell the
land and leave the forests, the land must
not get into the hands of another _non-tribal_
but must be available to tribals. He
must sell it to tribals or to the government,
which in turn is expected to distribute it
to tribals.

The law further presumes that every
_non-tribal_ who has land in the _scheduled
areas_ has purchased it from a tribal,
and puts on such _non-tribal_ the burden
of proving that neither he nor his predecessor
in title purchased it from a
tribal. The law moreover directs the
government not to wait for a tribal to
complain. An enquiry is permitted to be
taken up by the government on its own
(_suo motu_ is the legal expression) into
all occupation of land in the _scheduled
areas_ by the _non-tribals_, and the burden
of proving the legality of their occupation
is put upon the _non-tribals_. This is
the substance of the _Land Transfer Tegulation_
or _LTR_ as it is briefly called (its
full name in all its glory is: _Andhra
Pradesh Scheduled Areas Land Transfer
Regulation, 1959_ as amended by regulation
1 of 1970).

# Ineffective Enquiries

Yet the reality is that out of the 72,000
cases decided under the _LTR_ till September
30, 2005, 33,319 were decided in
favour of the _non-tribals_ and 33,078
against them. Of the 3,21,683 acres of
land involved in these cases, 1,62,989
acres were confirmed in favour of _non-tribals_
and 1,33,636 against them. If this
had been reflective of the ground reality
 --- there has been some kind of prohibition
of transfer of tribal land only after 1917
in the Andhra area and 1963 in the Telangana
area, and until 1959 tribal land could
be purchased by a _non-tribal_ with the
consent of the agent or district collector
even in the Andhra area --- there is nothing
much one could have said about it except
to ask for a more stringent law. But that
is not so. Most of these enquiries took
place well before there was any class of
even minimally educated persons among
the _scheduled tribes_. The enquiries therefore
took place over their heads. They had no
idea what was going in the _LTR_ cases, and
perforce had to depend upon the honesty
of any lawyer they may have engaged
(which was not often), the government
officials who prepare and keep the records,
and the higher government officials who
hear and decide _LTR_ cases. And it need not
be added that honesty is not a very common
attribute of '_vakils_' and the '_babus_'.

The enquiries also took place behind
their backs, in many cases. The _suo motu_
power given to the government to proceed
against _non-tribals_ without waiting for a
complaint from a tribal sounds like a good
thing, but in the given administrative
culture, it has perhaps been more of a
boon to the _non-tribals_ than to the tribals.
In proceedings taken up _suo motu_ by the
government, the _non-tribal_ faces only the
government. The government does not
take the trouble of finding out who among
the local tribals may have a claim to the
land. It does not publicise the enquiry in
the village. The officer hearing the cases
(designated a _special deputy collector_)
merely looks into the documents provided
by the _non-tribal_, and if they appear
reliable, okays the right of the _non-tribal_.
In the worst case, where the officer is
approachable, the _non-tribal_ actually
"persuades" him to take up a case against
him, gets an order declaring that his occupation
is within the law, and uses the
order against all subsequent _bona fide_
efforts to enquire into his right.

The early 1990s saw the rise of the first
generation of school-educated tribals all
over the state. In Jeelugumilli _mandal_ of
West Godavari district they found an NGO
called _Shakthi_ which had just the kind of
activism that the legal situation needed.
It taught them the rudiments of the law
and the meaning of land records. Joined
to the natural militancy of forest-dwellers,
it became a potent force. They occupied
the land held by _non-tribals_ which they
had reason to believe to be _adivasi_ land,
unmindful whether in the days of their
illiterate forebears some special deputy
collector had put his seal of approval on
the _non-tribal_'s right to it. And they
fought cases before the officers and the
courts. Their demand in the matter of
the concluded enquiries and the settled
rights of the _non-tribals_ was simple: all
that happened when we knew nothing
about the law or administration. Let all
the enquiries be reopened and done afresh,
with opportunity to us to contest the
cases. This was a far-reaching but just
demand which would require legislative
initiative. Needless to say, nothing was
done except for an executive order confined
to West Godavari district which
asked the local revenue officers to sit in
the villages and read the land records in
the presence of the tribal and _non-tribal_
villagers, take their views, and identify
illegality in land occupation of nontribals
for taking further action. That
executive order was implemented in just
a couple of villages and literally hundreds
of acres were found to be under illegal
occupation. Thereafter however its implementation
was frustrated by the intransigence
of the _non-tribals_.

# Role of _High Court_ Exposed

One of the institutions exposed by the
struggle of the newly awakened _adivasi_
youth was the _High Court_ of Andhra
Pradesh. When it was questioned why
_non-tribals_ were in possession of so many
doubtful acres in West Godavari district,
it came to light that one of the reasons
was a series of dubious orders passed by
the _High Court_. In the 1970s and 1980s,
_non-tribals_ of one village after another in
the district had made applications to the
president of India saying that their village
had been wrongly included in the _scheduled
area_ and should be excluded. They
then filed writ petitions in the _High Court_
and got all _LTR_ proceedings in their villages
stayed until the president of India
takes some decision on their application.
That a constitutional court could treat a
regulation passed under the fifth schedule
to the Constitution so cavalierly is a telling
comment on the constitutional world
view that prevails with our judiciary. The
tribal uprising of West Godavari district
shamed the _High Court_ into hastily vacating
the _stay orders_.

But this is just the role played by the
courts, especially the _High Court_ with its
extraordinary powers under the Constitution,
in matters of land rights of the
tribals or other poor under redistributive
statutes. Most of these rights are adjudicated
by administrative officers exercising
some kind of judicial powers (the law
calls it a quasi-judicial power). The idea
behind putting them outside the purview
of the courts and in the hands of the
administrative officers appears to have
been avoidance of the delay for which
civil courts are famous. But the remedy
has not been able to avoid the ills of
civil litigation. Firstly, most of these
statutes provide for a primary forum (the
_tahsildar_ or the revenue sub-divisional
officer) and one or two appeals within
the administration, with a power of review
placed in the hands of the government.
Nobody knows why such an elaborate
adjudicatory regime was devised for laws
meant to provide a quick remedy for
landlessness. And at any stage in this
process the _High Court_ can interfere to
correct procedural or jurisdictional errors,
which will be plenty because the administrative
officers know little law and care
less. So these cases often travel up and
down the hierarchical ladder of primary
and appellate authorities, with the possession
of the landlord or _non-tribal_ landholders
kept intact meanwhile by _interlocutory
orders_ of the _High Court_. Which brings us
to the second point, namely, that courts
in our country have not developed a
public law perspective on land disputes
under redistributive laws that is distinct
from the judicial view of property disputes
in private law. In the private law view,
the one who is in possession of the
property usually has his possession
protected until the entire litigation comes
to an end. In a proper public law view,
once the primary forum passes an order
holding the landlord/_non-tribal_ landholder
ineligible for enjoying the land,
he should be evicted and the land put in
the hands of the poor for whom the
proceedings are intended, leaving it to
the landlord/_non-tribal_ landholder to litigate
at leisure up and down the adjudicative
ladder. Lack of such a perspective
in judicial thinking has meant that a _non-tribal_
who has not an iota of right to the
land in his possession in the _scheduled
areas_ can enjoy it for decades on the
strength of _stay orders_ obtained from the
_High Court_ while pursuing his rights in
the unending adjudication by the _babus_
of the revenue department.

# Reforms --- A Mirage

The demand for reopening all the
thousands of cases decided in favour of
_non-tribals_ in the past remains, and its
articulate and inarticulate expression is
reflected in the frequently reported incidents
of clashes between tribals and _non-tribals_
in the _scheduled areas_. Unless the tribal
land struggle takes a much more strong
form, it is most unlikely that the government
will take any steps to make this
possible. For the motto of all land reform
measures in India has been to do what
little can be done for the poor without
hurting the rich too much. Speaking of
the _scheduled areas_ of Andhra Pradesh,
this is reflected for instance in the grant of
_ryotwari title_ to _non-tribals_ in continuous
occupation of unsettled land under the
_Ryotwari Settlement Regulations (Regulation
2 of 1970)_ for _scheduled areas_. A good
opportunity to get hold of a lot of land
for distribution to landless _adivasis_ was
lost by deciding not to evict such _non-tribals_.
But it was not an innocent mistake,
for lobbies of the privileged constantly
work to weaken all reform.

Forest land therefore becomes so important
for the _adivasis_. If they are unable
to withstand the onslaught of the _non-tribals_,
and if the government will do only
so much damage to the privileges of the
influential in the interests of the wretched,
the only thing the _adivasis_ can do is to
fall back on the forests. The law calls this
_encroachment_ but the law itself is the
encroacher in tribal habitat. It is more
properly called _customary occupation_, a
view that at long last the law too has taken,
with the _Scheduled Tribes and Other
Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition
of Forest Rights) Act_, (Act 2 of 2007).
For India as a whole, tribal occupation
described _post factum_ as _encroachment_,
plus actual encroachment by _non-tribal_
interests in the forests, is estimated to be
38.58 lakh acres, of which Andhra Pradesh
contributes about 7.5 lakhs, which is close
to 20 per cent. This state is next only to
Assam in the extent of this "encroachment".
(These are figures valid up to March
2004.) Andhra Pradesh also has the distinction
that not one acre of the tribal
occupation called _encroachment_ has been
regularised. One does not have a complete
break-up of the 7.5 lakh acres, but in an
affidavit filed in the _High Court_ by the
state government some years ago, it was
claimed that tribals supported by the
_Naxalites_ had occupied upwards of four
lakh acres in the forests. Whatever the
merits of the argument against deforestation,
it is a stark fact that this has made
all the difference between destitution and
bare existence for the _adivasis_.

# Polavaram Project

And then the projects started coming.
Polavaram project on the Godavari river
is located in the _scheduled area_ and will
displace (according to a 15-year old estimate)
a minimum of 276 villages, all of
them located in the _scheduled area_. The
population likely to be affected would be
about a lakh and a half, of which slightly
more than half are _adivasis_. This project
should in fact have been a test case for
the constitutional law of self-governance
in the _scheduled areas_: _The Provisions of
the Panchayats (Extension to the_Scheduled
Areas) Act, 1996_ or _PESA_ as it is popularly
called. That law provides for self-governance
by the _gram sabha_ in the
specific sense of the power to safeguard
and preserve traditions and customs,
cultural identity, community resources,
the power to prevent land alienation,
mandatory consultation with the _gram
sabha_ or _panchayat_ at the appropriate
level in the matter of land acquisition and
rehabilitation, etc. It should not have been
easy to undertake the project in the face
of these formidable-looking provisions,
but the government is happily going ahead.
While nine _mandals_ will be affected, all
of them in the _scheduled areas_, and the
_Mandal Praja Parishad_ (the middle tier of
the _panchayat system_) is the "_panchayat_
at the appropriate level" that has to be
consulted for land acquisition and rehabilitation,
not a single one of the nine has
been consulted. But the work on the
project is proceeding apace, notwithstanding
serious opposition from the _adivasis_.

When fears were expressed that even
if comprehensive rehabilitation is undertaken,
rehabilitation of the _adivasis_ outside
the _scheduled area_ would affect them
seriously in more than one way, for they
would not only be deprived of land,
habitations and the natural bounty of the
forests, but also the special rights recognised
by the special laws applicable to
the _scheduled areas_, the government came
forward with the assurance that all the
displaced _adivasis_ will be rehabilitated in
the _scheduled area_ itself. This sounded so
ridiculous that no one took it seriously,
for there is no land left unoccupied in the
_scheduled area_, much of it being forests
and the rest of it inhabited. It is indeed
unlikely that the government will be able
to rehabilitate all of them as promised,
but it has found a crooked way to accommodate
some at least and demonstrate its
alleged will. There is a considerable amount
of land in the _scheduled areas_ which is
under the occupation of tribals but to
which some _non-tribal_ has title on paper.
The most common instances are lands for
which the tribals have fought the _non-tribals_,
and successfully taken into their
possession. Another is land for which
some _non-tribal_ has acquired _ryotwari
title_ in settlement proceedings but tribal
occupants of the lands who know nothing
of the proceedings continue to be in possession,
resisting the efforts of the _non-tribal_
to enter the lands. The _non-tribals_
concerned are only too glad to "sell" that
land to the government, take compensation
for something which had long ceased to
be theirs, or had indeed never been theirs,
and leave the forests.

# Duplicitous Moves

The government is not acquiring these
lands under the _Land Acquisition Act_. It is
aware that if it does, the rights of the
_adivasis_ in possession would come in
question, for that much-maligned law
permits all claimants to the land under
acquisition to object to the process. Instead,
it is straightaway purchasing the land from
the willing _non-tribals_ for whom the
purchase price is an unsolicited gift. The
_LTR_ in fact does not permit this, for it
says that a _non-tribal_ wishing to sell land
in the _scheduled area_ should try to sell it
to tribals and only if he fails to find such
buyers the government may buy it. Flouting
this regulation, the government is straightaway
purchasing such land from _non-tribals_,
evicting the tribals in occupation,
and building colonies for rehabilitation of
tribals to be displaced by the reservoir in
the days to come.

Neat, is it not? Successful _adivasi_ land
struggles are defeated, the defeated _non-tribal_
is compensated, the uppity tribals
are shown their place, and the government's
promise of rehabilitation for the
displaced _adivasis_ in the _scheduled areas_
is kept. A _Revenue Divisional Officer (RDO)_ of
Rampachodavaram in East Godavari district,
who purchased 572 acres of such disputed
land, paying two crores to _non-tribals_, in
the two-month period between March and
May 2006, is said to have received much
appreciation from his superiors. The _babus_
are certainly efficient when and where
they want to be. Alert _adivasis_ moved the
_High Court_ against this fraud but the _High Court_
first insisted that all the _non-tribals_
whose lands have thus been purchased
must be impleaded as parties, and then
refused to stay the eviction of the tribals
in possession of the purchased land, saying
that no such blanket injunction can be
given. But as all the _adivasis_ to be displaced
by the Polavaram dam can hardly be accommodated
by such means, there is
considerable unrest and agitation in store,
especially in Khammam district where
much of the displacement lies, and in whose
thickly forested and undulating terrain there
is little scope for replicating the trick tried
successfully in East Godavari district.

# Tragic Tale of Internal Refugees

The northern part of Khammam district
along the Chhattisgarh border is the scene
of a more violent suppression of _adivasi_
land rights. There are about 35 forest
habitations, home to between nine and
190 families each adding up to 1,380
families in total, put up in the last two
years and more by _Gothi Koya_ or _Muria_
immigrants from Dantewara district of
Chhattisgarh. These are refugees of the
_Salwa Judum_-_Maoist_ conflict, mostly victims
of _Salwa Judum_ attacks on villages suspected
of harbouring the _Maoists_. Unable
to live in Dantewara any longer, these
refugees have put up huts in the forests of
Khammam district. They have been careful
not to cultivate land but have merely
put up huts and are labouring in neighbouring
_adivasi_ villages for livelihood.
Since the conflict in Dantewara started in
June 2005, many of these immigrants have
entered and put up huts in the Khammam
forests prior to December 13, 2005, the
magic cut off date for Act 2 of 2007:
rights of habitation and _usufruct_ enjoyed
by _adivasis_ in the forests prior to that date
are protected by that law. And so the forest
department personnel of Khammam should
not be troubling these people, but they
are regularly burning down the miserable
huts and trying to drive the immigrants
back to Dantewara, which means death
or starvation. Sarivela-Kothuru and Sunnam
Matka are two habitations that have been
set on fire not less than five times, the last
time being on September 1 this year. This
is a brutal continuation of the Chhattisgarh
tragedy beyond that state's borders, and
it leaves the _adivasis_ shelterless in the sun
and the rain. Parenthetically, it must be said
that while India is signatory to inter-national
instruments concerning refugees, and has
been kind to some such as the Tibetans and
Myanmarese, it has no law or policy concerning
internal refugees, of whom the most
numerous are _adivasis_, whether driven by
hunger or projects or social conflict.

# The Bauxite Mining Project

We will end with bauxite mining, which
is a more comprehensive saga of riding
roughshod over the legal regime applicable
to the _scheduled areas_ and the rights of
the _scheduled tribes_. Bauxite ore is available
on an extensive scale in a belt
stretching from southern Orissa to northern
Andhra Pradesh. The whole of it is in the
_scheduled areas_. It is being mined vigorously
by Orissa in the districts of Rayagada,
Kalahandi and Koraput. Excepting
the NALCO's[^nalco] project at Damanjodi, all
the others are in the private sector. This
is contrary not just to the law but the
Constitution as well, for grant of mining
lease in the _scheduled areas_ to _non-tribals_
amounts to transfer of land from the
government to a _non-tribal_, which the fifth
schedule to the Constitution prohibits, as
held by the Supreme Court in _Samatha
vs State of AP_ (1997). Not that displacement
by a public sector unit is less painful,
but what is in issue is the casualness
of the whole thing. The government of
Orissa has been indulging in bluff, claiming
that the Samatha judgment applies
only to Andhra Pradesh and not to other
states. That is rubbish, but nobody in
Orissa has been willing to call the bluff.
Since not only mining of ore but its
processing to produce alumina for export
is also being undertaken in the _scheduled
area_, considerable extent of land is being
handed over to the companies. The mine
site, the site for the refinery and the captive
power plant, and the sites for the ash pond
and effluent (red mud) pond, are the actual
extents of land taken over, but a lot of
land nearby will become uninhabitable
and uncultivable once the industry starts.
Any unilateral decision of the government
in these matters without reference to the
_gram sabhas_ of the affected villages is
contrary to _PESA_, but Orissa is going
ahead unmindful. Where the administration
felt it necessary to have the consent of
the _gram sabha_, it has commandeered the
consent by police force. And where it
found it had no answer to the resistance
of the people, it has put it down by brute
force. Three _adivasis_ were killed at Maikanch
in Kashipur block of Rayagada
district on December 16, 2000, and hundreds
have been jailed before and thereafter.
The resistance of the _adivasis_ has
however been remarkable, especially
against the Utkal Aluminium's project at
Kucheipadar in Kashipur block.

[^nalco]: National Aluminium Company Limited (NALCO) is a Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSE) under Ministry of Mines, Govt. of India.

The bauxite ore extends into the _scheduled
area_ of Visakhapatnam district of Andhra
Pradesh. Proposals to lease land to a
private company for mining and processing
the ore were initiated during Chandrababu
Naidu's days, but since Andhra Pradesh
at any rate cannot say that the Samatha
judgment does not apply, the efforts were
abandoned. It is typical of Chandrababu's
mindset that he tried to get the fifth
schedule to the Constitution itself amended
to save his aluminium project. And it
is typical of the influence he wielded at
Delhi in those days that his proposal was
taken as an order and a note prepared by
the union ministry of mines for amending
the Constitution! Nothing happened, fortunately,
and after Y S Rajasekhara
Reddy became chief minister, the government
decided to cheat the law rather than
amend it. Two mining sites have been
chosen, and the mining leases have been
given to the public sector _AP Mineral
Development Corporation (APMDC)_,
which will mine the ore and sell it to
private concerns that will process it
outside the _scheduled area_. The _APMDC_
is thus a _benami_ for the private concerns.
Whatever the legality of this devise (the
_LTR_ specifically bars _benami_ transactions
in favour of _non-tribals_), it does not
answer the main concern of the _adivasis_.
Bauxite is found on flat-topped hills,
and while the government typically points
to the small extent of the mine site,
which is usually uninhabited, the concern
is with the displacing effect the mining
will have in the valley around, and the
effect on the drainage of water that runs
off the bauxite hill. Quite extensive
displacement and severe pollution of
water sources are certain, and the _adivasis_
are almost unanimously against
the project. Since the land losers at the
processing sites outside the _scheduled
area_ are equally vigorously opposing
the land acquisition, the bauxite project
of the government is facing serious
opposition.

The issue is not to be answered by
rhetorically counterposing "development" of
the country to the myopic self-centredness
of the few. Either development will be
defined to include the needs and aspirations
of all, or every project will be a
scene of conflict as India heads hungrily
towards two-digit growth. Unlike in the
trustful days of the past, the notion of
development is looked at sceptically by
the smallest people today, which is a
welcome change. The tendency to pretend
that nothing has changed, with its concomitant
insensitivity to opposition, inevitably
leaves the matter to the police,
resulting in broken heads and worse. That
is entirely unacceptable, whatever differences
there may be about the meaning
and need of development.
