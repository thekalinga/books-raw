_About 25,000 people, by official count, have been killed in Kashmir in
the last six years, about two-thirds of them by the Indian armed forces.
Kashmiris put the number at 50,000. Yet democratic public opinion in
India has remained largely silent, except for occasionally expressing
disapproval of army atrocities. Is only killing people in a staged crossfire
a human rights violation? Is the denial of the right of self-determination
itself not act of human rights violation?_

\

Now that cynical realism believes it has
won some sort of a victory in Kashmir, it
is time to talk of some principles --- principles
pertaining not only to the way the rulers of
India have been dealing with Kashmir, but
also the way progressive and democratic-minded
Indians have been responding to
Kashmir, and to the problems stemming
from the mode of expression of the cause
of Kashmiri _self-determination_. Criticism of
the rulers is easy and uncomplicated, at least
in principle, if one has no material or ideological
interests vested in the matter. The
others are less easy, less familiar and less
comfortable, but unless we learn to formulate
such critiques, the cause of progress and
democracy will remain stuck at 1989.

India has quite a sizeable section of intellectuals,
activists and political movements
committed to the democratic cause. 'Democracy',
of course, is not an uncomplicated
expression, and if the _bourgeois_ version of
it is full of problems, then so is the leftist
version of it. Indian democrats, movements
and activists, for instance, have reacted
strongly to quite a few instances of
suppression of the democratic aspirations of
different sections of the people, as a matter
of democratic principle; but they have
remained brutally silent --- or else exhibited
a low-key response --- about others. One need
not add that there are a few honourable
exceptions. The silence is not due to oversight
or preoccupation with more urgent matters.
That may be excused. The silence, on the
contrary, is studied and deliberate. It is quite
frequently even theorised. A close analysis
of the reasons proffered for the lack of equal
enthusiasm to speak up in each of these cases
would reveal a lot of unsuspected problems
with what is commonly understood as the
democratic worldview by those who believe
their understanding is untrammelled by
_bourgeois_ or other limitations.

# DOUBLE STANDARDS

Kashmir is one example. About 25,000
people have been killed in Kashmir in the
last six years --- by official count --- about two-thirds
of them by the Indian armed forces.
Kashmiris put the number at 50,000. Western
human rights organisations and some Indian
civil rights groups have documented army
atrocities on the Kashmiris in considerable
detail. Kashmiris, for their part, have not
only documented their suffering but also
argued over and over again their case for
the exercise of the right of _self-determination_.
Their arguments are difficult to refute except
by resorting to cynical political 'realism',
which can be given progressive padding by
referring to the US machinations in the South
Asia. Yet, the democratic public opinion of
India has remained largely silent except to
occasionally express disapproval of army
atrocities. Kashmiris tirelessly ask every
human rights activist they meet whether
only getting killed in a staged cross-fire is
a human rights violation, and whether the
denial of the right of _self-determination_
is not in itself an act of human rights
violation. The response from much of 'democratic'
public opinion in India is a stony
silence.

A prominent leftist intellectual, writing in
the columns of this journal, has cautioned
those who would defend _self-determination_
in Kashmir to realise that what they are
defending is _religious self-determination_.
Others, equally well known for their
progressive views, have said that the option
of plebiscite cannot be allowed to the
Kashmiris because it is likely to be exercised
communally. In other words, they will be
allowed to choose only if they are not going
to choose Pakistan, which choice, if made,
is axiomatically believed to be on religious
or communal (and it is not clear whether the
two are the same) grounds. Nobody has as
yet said that elections must no longer be held
in Maharashtra because the electorate is
exhibiting a tendency to make the communal
choice of voting for the BJP and Shiv Sena,
but the same argument is believed to be valid
in the case of Kashmir. If someone wishes
to argue that there is a difference between
a choice made within the Indian state and
the choice of seceding from the Indian state,
then one would like to hear some argument
that would show that the double standards
are justified by this difference.

Is Kashmiri _self-determination_ a religious
aspiration? Is it the case that it is necessarily
classifiable as either religious or secular? Is
all that is religious necessarily communal?
Is a religious aspiration to be denied even
if it is not communal? Assuming that it is
communal, is all that is communal necessarily
to be banned in order to get rid of it? How
far is the idea that the freedom to choose
ought to be and can be denied in order to
prevent harmful choices valid? It has a certain
validity in the case of physically harmful
things such as drugs, but how far can one
take it in the realm of ideas and identities
without making nonsense of the notion of
democracy? In general, is the potential for
evil human beings best exorcised --- or at all
exorcised --- by depriving them of their right
to make free choices? What, anyway, is the
source of evil --- such as, for instance,
communal divisiveness --- in human beings,
and how are we to ever overcome it?

A comprehensive discussion of these
questions is necessary if democratic public
opinion in India is ever to complete a _self-critical_
examination of its attitude towards
the 'Kashmir problem', and the dubious
doctrinal certitudes that underlie it. What
can be attempted here is only a preliminary
discussion of it.

# IS KASHMIRI IDENTITY RELIGIOUS?

What exactly the Kashmiris mean by
'_azaadi_'[^azaadi] may not be easy to determine. Perhaps
all of them do not mean the same thing. In
any case, there are too many guns around
for a frank expression of views. Moreover,
a troubled people soon learn to tell whatever
the questioner expects from them, a
deviousness that their troubled state teaches
them. One thing is however clear, that they
have a strong sense of their distinct identity,
and '_azaadi_' is an emotive expression of that
distinctness, even if in concrete political
terms it means different things to different
people, or nothing more specific than a yearning
for a free existence for many. Everywhere
in Kashmir, though more in urban than in
rural areas, the response to any talk of '_azaadi_'
is spontaneous and enthusiastic, even in the
least propitious circumstances.

[^azaadi]: Freedom from oppression; Also used for Independence.

Most secular-minded persons in India will
immediately ask: is this identity religious?
One thing can be said without any hesitation:
it is certainly not irreligious. If that puts a
question mark on our sympathy for that
identity, then there is something wrong with
our understanding of popular identities. The
identity of a people is what they are in their
own eyes, the self-image about which they
feel strongly, irrespective of how one
interprets it in relation to their material
existence. And religion is an integral part
of what most people are in their own eyes.
Islam, the way Kashmiri Muslims believe
it and practise it, is very much a part of the
identity that they feel so strongly for. If
irreligious or non-religious identities alone
deserve support, then no national _self-determination_
movement can ever be
supported, because there is no national
identity --- at least in the third world --- that
is totally devoid of a religious dimension.
Of course, this raises the question whether
such a religious identity can guarantee the
security and the cultural freedom of
minorities, and what assurances will be given
in this regard. The Islam that Kashmiris
believe in and practise has in the past been
on the whole a syncretic and relatively open
system of beliefs and attitudes, which has
prevented the Islamic element of the Kashmiri
identity from becoming a hindrance to a
common Kashmiri identity shared with the
Hindus. Communal fanaticism has not been
a notable characteristic of the Kashmiri mind.
Hopefully, the events of the last six years
have not made much difference to this, though
embittered émigré _pandits_ do say that things
have irrevocably changed now. It is perhaps
not an insignificant matter that the Sikhs in
Kashmir have not left the valley, and do not
seem to feel the kind of discomfort that one
would expect in the presence of an alien
fundamentalism. How much of the _pandits_'
views is born of distrust, which no doubt
finds evidence in the actions of the Pakistan-backed
fundamentalist elements in Kashmir,
and how much is a realistic appreciation of
actual change in the attitudes of the average
Kashmiri Muslim is a matter of doubt. There
is certainly plenty of hostility towards India
in Kashmir, but little hatred of Hindus as
such. And even as regards the hostility
towards India, one hears people say with
surprising regularity that what they hate is
India and not Indians. That they feel impelled
to express this clarification is perhaps a
tribute to their pride in their tolerant and
friendly culture.

But the question whether Kashmiri _self-determination_
is religious _self-determination_
seeks specifically to know whether the
Kashmiri desire to exercise the right of _self-determination_
harks back to the two-nation
theory: that, being mostly Muslims, they
must join Pakistan. Whether such a desire
must necessarily be branded communal is
a legitimate counter-query. And whether be
it communal or not --- it is to be met by
suppressing the desire of _self-determination_
is another legitimate counter-query. There
are certainly some in Kashmir who frankly
believe in the two-nation theory as a political
faith. The _Jamaat-e-Islami_ of Kashmir holds
the view that as a Muslim majority region,
Kashmir must be in Pakistan; and so do most
of the other (smaller) Islamic organisations.
There are even a few who believe in panIslamism
as an ideology. However, it is
worth mentioning the views of _People's
League_ leader Shabir Ahmed Shah, one of
the most respected of the _Hurriat Conference_
leaders, a cultured and soft-spoken man who
has a rare concern for ethical propriety in
politics. He makes a distinction between
what he calls religious fundamentalism
(hatred or denigration of other religions),
which in his view is wrong, and political
fundamentalism (by which he means the
inseparability of religion and politics), which
in his view is not wrong. He has gone out
of his way to address the _pandit_ refugees in
Jammu and ask them to come back to the
valley, for Kashmir in his view is incomplete
without them. The question whether he has
an answer to all the difficulties that are likely
to arise from such a viewpoint need not
detain us now. What is instructive is the clear
distinction he makes, and the vocal concern
for tolerance and amity between Hindus and
Muslims that he --- like many Kashmiris
 --- is able to combine, not as a matter of political
tactics, but of genuine conviction, with his
unflinching faith in the only Truth.

But by all accounts, it appears that for
what may be called the average Kashmiri
Muslim, Islam means the humane and tolerant
tradition of the religion as interpreted by the
Kashmiri _sufis_, whose influence is
symbolised by the _ziarats_ that dot the valley,
and is as inseparable from the Kashmiri
identity as the latter is inseparable from
Islam. As a consequence, pan-Islamism or
the two-nation theory, it is said, do not
attract the Kashmiris much. How true is this
opinion? It is interesting that when the
Kashmiris are asked whether liberated
Kashmir is likely to be a _theocracy_ or a
_secular democracy_, those who identify with
the syncretic and humane tradition answer
without hesitation that it will be a _secular
democracy_, whereas the fundamentalists
reply in evident doubt that 'it is for the
people to decide'. A more interesting test
of the belief is the ideology being resorted
to by the Indian army's surrogates in Kashmir,
the sponsored counter-insurgents, all of them
criminal gangs, in their bid to attract
legitimacy in the valley. Their proclaimed
worldview is the synthetic and tolerant culture
of what is being called _Kashmiriyat_. They
evidently profess this ideology, not to attract
the _pandits_ who are a minuscule minority,
nor Indian public opinion, which is happy
with any counter-insurgents, howsoever
criminal and howsoever oriented
ideologically, but the Kashmiri Muslims.
Kuka Parrey alias Jamshed Shirazi, the
_Shahenshah_ of these army-led criminals, has
repeatedly said that his enmity with Pakistan-supported
groups such as the _Hizb-ul-Mujahideen_
is because they are out to destroy
the tolerant and humane traditions of
Kashmir. It is not known how honestly he
believes all this, for as the _JKLF_ leader Yasin
Malik points out, this man was a pan-Islamic
militant before he turned into an agent of
the Indian army, but it is instructive that he
professes to do so. It is evidently aimed at
the common Kashmiri Muslims, and neither
the Indian state nor the _pandits_ who are
interested only in his guns and not his
ideology. And yet, any perceived insult to
Islam would enrage the Kashmiris and result
in violent popular outbursts, such as were
seen twice in the past, in 1963--64and 1973,
much before the rise of militancy.

How does one make sense of all this? Does
it mean, somebody will ask in exasperation,
that when --- and if --- it comes to choosing,
Kashmiris will not choose Pakistan on
grounds of religious affinity? Or that they
will? How does one understand their choice
if they do? And how if they do not?
Progressive-minded people are accustomed
to two modes of thought. One, stemming
from the Marxist tradition, which has a
framework of interpretation that is said to
provide answers to all basic social questions,
and a strategy of class struggle that is said
to provide solutions to all basic social
problems, at least in principle. But the
answers and solutions provided by that
tradition to questions concerning religious
and ethnic identities, and indeed to all
problems other than those concerning
economic class struggles, have proved
extremely inadequate. And the second, more
recent tradition, stemming from what is
usually called the post-modern worldview
(if a view that will not unequivocally endow
the world with any greater reality than that
of a mental construct can be graced with that
title) in which questions do not call for
answers, but an interrogation of the question,
usually to discover that it really means
something else. Neither of these traditions
will really help us answer these questions,
though the Marxist tradition is at least capable
of being revised and reformulated to provide
a useful guide to thought. Hopefully, at least
in the coming century, radical thought will
get over this empty choice between dubious
certitudes and the certitude of only doubt,
and learn to seek real answers to the real
problems of real human existence.

# WILL KASHMIRIS CHOOSE PAKISTAN?

In the meanwhile, what about the question
we began with: is Kashmiri _self-determination_
religious _self-determination_?
If it comes to choosing, will they choose
Pakistan? It is difficult to know for certain.
It is quite possible that if both India and
Pakistan honourably guarantee not only the
existence but also the peaceful development
of Kashmir (for it will be a landlocked
country if it comes into being), most
Kashmiris will prefer an independent
Kashmir. But if that guarantee is not
forthcoming, as is quite possible, they may
well choose Pakistan, not for reasons only
of religious affinity but also because it makes
social and economic sense. Kashmir was,
prior to partition, linked to the rest of the
subcontinent through what is today's
Pakistan and not through the Banihal pass.
Its commercial and social (not merely
religious) links were with today's Pakistan.
To travel by road from the Kashmir valley
to Pakistan is easy all the year round, whereas
to go to India is a tedious journey that leaves
you exhausted by the time you reach Jammu,
unless you have the money to fly. And that
road too is closed for about three months
in the year. This '_atut ang_[^atut-ang]' this inseparable
organ of India, is unapproachable from India
for a quarter of the calendar year, unless one
has the money to fly, and this has been so
for the last 50 years for which Kashmir has
been a --- repeatedly proclaimed --- '_atut ang_'
of India. Such is the shame we bear. And
in these days when the market is everything,
when development is allegedly only market-driven,
does it not make perfect economic
sense to choose the country with which
communication links are palpably better,
that too when the region, like Kashmir, is
dependent upon export of apples, dry fruit
and handicrafts, and the import of tourists?
At least our World Bank-driven intellectuals
and the Manmohan admirers among our
newspaper columnists must accept that for
Kashmiris the choice of Pakistan is the most
rational one.

[^atut-ang]: Integral part. Used by Indian state while denying the right of Kashmiris thier right to self-determination.

But suppose that Kashmiris want to choose
Pakistan on the religious ground that they
feel happy and fully satisfied in their identity
if they live with their co-religionists, what
exactly is objectionable about it?
Communalism, in the sense of a hateful
attitude towards people of other religions,
is bad (though what one does about it is
another matter). But what exactly is wrong
about empathy with one's co-religionists if
it does not entail hatred or disparagement
of other religions? It may be said that religious
identities inevitably lead to communal hatred.
That the possibility is there cannot be denied,
but there is nothing inevitable about it, and
anyway the same danger is present with
linguistic and ethnic identities. But human
beings find it difficult to live without
identities. It would certainly be nice if people
did not have a tendency to gather together
in religious, ethnic, linguistic groupings,
and lived happily together in the most
disparate groups. That is not easy for human
beings, and is never going to be easy, though
it is both necessary and possible to mitigate
feelings of prejudice and hatred born of
disparate identities. But if _self-determination_
based upon language or ethnicity is not
regarded as bad so long as it is not driven
by sectarian hatred of others and makes
territorial sense, why should not religious
_self-determination_ be acceptable on the same
footing? One hopes somebody will give
some answer other than that Lenin or Stalin
said this or that about 'the nationality
question'.

_Realpolitik_, of course, has an answer,
which many (Hindu) leftists in India will not
feel ashamed to echo. With the Taliban
capturing Kabul and the mullahs of Teheran
closing in on deviant women, the danger of
Islamic fundamentalism becomes a
convenient argument for India and Indians
to deny freedom to the Kashmiris. Even if
the Kashmiri Muslims are themselves not
communal, it will be said, the successful
secession of Kashmir will strengthen --- if
only in spirit --- the forces of Muslim
fundamentalism, which it is everybody's
duty in today's world to thwart. Poor
Kashmiris, therefore, will have to be
sacrificed for the noble cause of what we
call 'secularism' and what the US calls
'democracy'. But whether anybody likes it or
not, and whether the Kashmiris are sacrificed
or not, there is a good likelihood that the
first half of the next century will belong to
Islamic fundamentalism the way the first
half of this century belonged to socialist
dogmatism. The reign of Islam will in all
likelihood get into a crisis faster than that
of Marxism-Leninism, for the wisdom of the
_mulla_ backed by the gun of the _mujahid_ has
far, far fewer answers to the problems of
modern human existence than the formulas
of Marxism-Leninism. And then, perhaps
--- unless some new dogma comes up in the
meanwhile, which cannot be ruled out, given
the human hunger for absolutes --- we can
all sit down to think out a viable (that is to
say, humanly possible) alternative to the
mode of life imposed by this monstrosity
called corporate capitalism, _sans_ dogmatic
and utopian assumptions about absolutely
and exclusively true ideas, endlessly
perfectible human beings and paradisical
human relations. Why should poor Kashmiris
lose in the meanwhile?

Let us get back to two questions raised
earlier, and try to discuss them, for they are
of importance to progressive theory and
practice. One is that Kashmir has seen a very
determined militant struggle for '_azaadi_' for
more than six years with widespread mass
support and even sporadic mass participation.
And yet nobody is able to say with certainty
what exactly the Kashmiris mean when they
talk of '_azaadi_'. Why is this so? The second
is that, assuming that all that has been said
above about the Kashmiri ethos is wrong,
and that the Kashmiris are driven by rabid
fundamentalist hatredof secular/Hindu India
to raise the demand for _self-determination_,
as embittered _émigré_ _pandits_ say, is the
denial of that right in the name of refusing
to acknowledge the legitimacy of
communalism a justifiable attitude, as many
'leftists' in India seem to think?

# ASSESSING 'WHAT PEOPLE THINK'

The first question is pertinent to many
more contexts than just Kashmir. How does
one gauge 'what the people really think' in
the presence of arms? Armed rebellions are
raging all over the world, including India.
All of them claim to speak in the name of
some oppressed section of the people. It is
certainly true that there can be no armed
upsurge without some degree of support
from the people in whose name it speaks.
But how deep is the support? To what extent
does the rebellion really represent "the
people's interests" as it claims? How does
one get behind the bullets and assess what
the alleged real protagonists think about the
whole thing?

There is no easy answer to this question,
but today it is --- and is going to be for a long
time to come --- a vital question for a
democratic attitude towards politics. For
_armed politics_ has come to stay. More and
more, dissenting politics in the world tends
to take to arms, and that creates the problem
of understanding what exactly the politics
represents. Till now weapons have been
seen by radical intellectuals in terms of their
efficacy in realising the cherished goal of
'_liberation_', the one-point terminus of much
radical thought. The fact that most
intellectuals are struck simultaneously by
mortal fear and romantic awe of weapons
has made a closer look at _armed politics_
difficult. If we are able to get over the
infatuation with the terminal notion of
_liberation_ and learn to see progress as a (real,
but) much more imperfect and wobbly
process, staggered in time and liable to
regression, whose ideal summation may be
called _liberation_ to satisfy the common human
urge for perfection in ideas, then it becomes
easy to see _armed politics_ for what it is: a
form of politics. And as a form of politics
it is liable to be questioned for its democratic
content and not just the '_liberative_' potential
of its aims. What exactly is its relation with
the people it claims to represent? How much
freedom does it allow those people to direct
its activity? What are the mechanisms it has
created to ensure that those people can
effectively hold it answerable to them? These
are today important questions for a
democratic understanding of political
movements, for the era of peaceful mass
movements is rapidly giving way to the era
of the rebel's gun, for a variety of reasons,
some understandable in the sense that the
choice is evidently ineluctable, and some
certainly not.

Such questions would not pose a major
problem in the case of unarmed movements.
When a Medha Patkar or a Sharad Joshi
claims to speak on behalf of the evacuees
of the Narmada dam or the farmers of
Maharashtra, the truth or falsity of the claim
is tested easily enough. The people in whose
name they claim to speak have no reason
to support them or to keep silent if they do
not agree with them, and the disagreement
will soon be evident. It is different with
_armed politics_. As Abdul Gani, the voluble
professor of the Persian language who
officiates as the spokesperson of Kashmir's
_All-Party Hurriat Conference_ likes to say,
"when the guns speak, politics becomes
silent". More precisely, the politics of those
who carry the gun may or may not become
silent, but the people in whose name the gun
speaks gradually withdraw into silence. It
is partly due to the fear of getting caught
(literally and figuratively) in the crossfire,
if one draws attention to oneself by talking
too much; more particularly, there is the fear
of being branded an 'agent' of the other
party, by either party. To add to this there
is the rather tricky fact (from the point of
assessing 'what the people really want') of
the very human tendency to find oneself in
agreement with those who have power in
their hands. All authority thrives upon this
weakness, whether it is the authority of the
state or the authority of the rebel's gun.
When one views authority in this role as an
ideology, as something that commands
obedience not by virtue of its truth but by
virtue of its power, it should be realised that
the ideological trait is based upon this very
human weakness. (All ideology, incidentally,
draws sustenance from some weakness in
the human subject, whether individual or
collective, whether purely psychological or
social-psychological, a fact that is of far-reaching
consequence for rethinking radical
theories of human existence and progress.)
Armed rebellions, therefore, frequently give
the impression of greater public acquiescence
in their ideas and deeds than would be the
case if they were unarmed. It may be asked:
how does one judge this when --- or to the
extent that --- the acquiescence is willing and
conscious? The argument here is certainly
not that there is something that the people
'really' believe in as against what they think
they believe. Any such notion can be quite
fascist. But the ideology of power that induces
acquiescence reveals its presence when its
authority takes a beating --- as when the
armed rebels are driven back --- and the
people find themselves (it is not the case that
this always happens) doubting their past
acquiescence. One is then left wondering
what exactly the ideas acquiesced in
represented when they were apparently
widely accepted.

In this situation, to know what the people
want, or to ensure that what they want alone
is expressed in their name, is not easy. The
former is a problem for analysis, but the
latter is a problem as well for democratic
politics, the problem of ensuring the
accountability of 'people's movements' to
the people. It is of course true that 'what the
people think' is not a stable thing. It changes
as their perception of their strength changes.
The fact that there is an armed --- and therefore
powerful --- force functioning on their behalf
may well affect their perception of what they
want. Such a genuine perception of their
strength must be distinguished from the
ideology of the gun referred to earlier. The
distinction is revealed, as said above, when
the gun takes a beating, but not before. The
problem is that there is no way of knowing
the exact extent to which the silent or vocal
assent of the people is an indication of the
perception of their strength, and not any of
the reasons enumerated earlier. But the fact
that what the people want is not a static nor
an easily determinable thing, is certainly no
excuse for allowing anybody with effective
weapon power to claim that their power
entitles them to represent the people's
aspirations before the world, and to pass off
all their deeds as the deeds of the people,
taking advantage of the silence that follows
_armed politics_. Practitioners of _armed politics_
frequently resort to such claims, with the
added prestige of _liberators_ or _mujahids_ to
back them. But their accountability to the
people is not something one can leave to
their _self-discipline_, reposing confidence in
their commitment as '_liberators_' of the
'masses'. Nobody can be trusted so far with
power. It is, and must be, a matter of public
concern, a matter of concern for the
democratic intelligentsia and the human
rights movement, which must learn, in these
days of _armed politics_, to be more concerned
with the democratic content of political forms
of rebel movements than the millennium
their weapons promise to bring about. In
Kashmir, for instance, one frequently hears
the opinion that the outlook of the Kashmiris
is more truly represented by the worldview
of the militarily badly weakened _Jammu and
Kashmir Liberation Front_ (_JKLF_) than that
of the heavily armed Pakistan-backed _Hizb-ul-Mujahideen_
whose ideologues in the _All
Party Hurriat Conference_ speak confidently
in the name of the Kashmiris. If this is true,
such a tragic anomaly must itself be as much
a matter of concern to democratic-minded
analysts and human rights activists as the
denial of Kashmiri aspirations by the Indian
state. And now we have tragedy turning into
farce with the thoroughly unpopular India-backed
counter-insurgent gangs claiming
from within the bunkers of the _Border
Security Force_ that it is they who represent
the true voice of the Kashmiris.

# FREEDOM AND EVIL

Let us turn to the second question:
assuming that a people wish to exercise the
right of _self-determination_ on purely
communal grounds, is that right then to be
denied to them in the interests of 'progress'
and 'democracy'? Here the question is not
whether freedom is an absolute thing; nothing
in this world is or can be absolute. That much
the history of the 20th century, the century
of grotesque absolutes, teaches us. But the
question is: what is the relation between
freedom and evil? Is freedom a thing to be
necessarily suppressed in order to forestall
evil ? Or does freedom perhaps have a positive
role in overcoming evil? This is a difficult
question, but it is likely to be posed again
and again as fundamentalism of religious
and ethnic varieties sweeps across the world.
Progressive-minded persons are likely to be
caught on the same side as dictators unless
some serious thought is given to the matter.

What is the nature of evil in human social
consciousness and behaviour? By evil, we
here mean oppressive, hateful and other
similar traits that set people one against the
other. We are not here asking this question
with reference to the actions and ideas of
those whose position in the social structure
implies and requires such evil. We are asking
this about the acceptance of and participation
in such evil by others, without which it
cannot sustain itself. And about other
situations where one cannot point to any
dominant vested interests that are served by
the evil. Why is it that not only those who
have a vested interest in perpetuating a
particular form of evil but even the 'common
people', as they are usually called, become
accomplices in it? And are they always only
accomplices and never the originators of
evil? In particular, what prevents people
from overcoming divisive and hate-filled
fundamentalism and reaching out to their
fellow-creatures in friendship and love, which
obviously benefits everyone excepting only
those who profit by dividing the people?
Why do people who gain nothing materially
from it succumb to it?

All the answers that radical theories have
are centred on the externality of the sources
of evil in popular consciousness. Evil in
people's minds is a consequence of successful
hegemonic devices put in motion by the
oppressors and internalised by the masses
because of the pressures of oppression and
deprivation; or else it is a skewed perception
of reality caused by conditions of oppression
and privation. A more sophisticated
explanation is that the presence of multiple
hierarchies at all levels of society makes
possible the reproduction, at all levels, of
the divisive and oppressive ideology of
power, which basically serves the interests
of the ruling classes.

These explanations contain enough truth
to make them seem sufficient to those who
do not wish to face more uncomfortable
questions. The hegemonic efforts, the
people's privations and the multiple
hierarchies are all equally external to people's
consciousness. They act upon it from outside
and corrupt it from outside, which is a
comforting idea to hold. But in truth, the
human mind is not just an empty receptacle
that receives the hegemonic ideas of the
rulers, nor a bad reflector that somehow
converts its sufferings into hatred for the
wrong party taking the cue from the
motivated codes built into the ruling culture,
nor a copying machine that reproduces in
thought the ideology of power that stems
from the omnipresent structures of
dominance. Even if an idea has its roots in
hegemonic manipulation or other external
conditions, it becomes possible only if there
is something it can catch on to in the structure
of the recipients' consciousness. We do not
take in ideas from outside. Ideas (including
ideology, which is often supposed to originate
in the interests of others) are shaped in the
process of making sense of our existence in
the course of interaction with external reality,
a process that involves on the side of the
subject the whole of the human personality,
which is a dynamically shaped product of
the interaction between the complex human
psychic structure and external conditions
and influences. Unless this edifice of our
psychic structure and the process of formation
of the personality and of consciousness
provide scope for certain patterns of belief
and response, attachment to the ideas (or
ideology) is not possible, whatever be the
external interests they serve, or the external
conditions they originate in, if any. It is not
enough, therefore, to have a theory of the
material basis --- or rather, more properly, the
external conditions --- of evil in human
consciousness and behaviour. It is necessary
also to have a theory of its human basis. It
is not enough to analyse the external interests
served by the evil, or the external conditions
that underlie it; nor merely to devise strategies
for getting rid of them. It is necessary also
to understand the internal potential for
complicity with such evil in the structure of
the human personality, and the moral
conditions in which it can be overcome, or
at least subdued. Radical theories have shaped
plenty of theoretical tools for looking
critically at the structures and processes of
oppression, but when it comes to looking
critically at the oppressed, the only theoretical
tool available is the notion of ideology,
whether it originates in the hegemonic
manipulations of the rulers, or the privation
of the oppressed, or the omnipresent
multiplicity of the structures of oppression,
or some combination of these.

This very basic gap in radical theory can
easily lead to an abdication of the
responsibility of theoretical effort, in the
name of eschewing 'totalising' thought. If
by 'totalising' thought is meant any effort
to lay down a finite set of interpretative
principles that will explain 'everything', it
is certainly to be eschewed. That is
impossible, and the dogmatic belief that it
is possible will in all likelihood lead to
_totalitarian politics_. But the world is an
interconnected totality, whether one likes it
or not, and it is the responsibility of theory
to make as much sense of it as is realistically
possible, if any real progress is to be achieved
in human affairs. That attempt must not be
called 'totalising' in the pejorative sense. To
take in the world only as unconnected bits
and pieces is to give up the responsibility
of thinking theoretically about progress.

It is not proposed to make any attempt
here to fill up this theoretical gap, but if it
is clear that the human complicity with or
capacity for social evil has roots within, as
much as the evil may have roots without,
it should also be clear that a _self-critical_
attitude is necessary if evil is to be overcome.
A merely critical attitude towards the external
conditions of existence is not sufficient. And
freedom is an essential precondition for a
_self-critical_ attitude towards one's inner
potential for the bad. Only a free people will
be _self-critical_. In particular, an unfree people,
shackled in the name of their attachment to
evil, will never look at the inner roots of their
attachment to it, but will use their unfreedom
to make a virtue of it. Freedom is a necessary
precondition for _self-criticism_, though it runs
the risk (which will immediately be pointed
out) that it does not always guarantee it. It
is because evil in the consciousness of people
is always seen to have roots exclusively
without, that progressive-minded persons
are attracted to the seemingly sensible idea
that the best way to exorcise evil is to build
walls that will keep it away, restrict the
freedom to make recourse to it, and work
to alter, the material conditions that have
given rise to it Or perhaps the reasoning is
more cynical: that people, if they are allowed
the freedom, will be fatally attracted by evil,
and so the only way to prevent their
degeneration is to shackle them until the
Utopian millennium in which everybody is
an angel descends upon the earth. But on
the contrary, the freedom to critically
overcome one's capacity for and complicity
with evil (oppressive and hateful values and
structures that set one human being above
or against another) can be a positive aid to
the process by which human beings will
attain whatever perfection is possible for
them. If complicity with hateful and
oppressive ideas is seen to be not something
imposed from outside, but as something that
grows in the process of interaction between
the inside and the outside, then we will
realise that freedom and the responsibility
that freedom brings with it will alone make
possible the _self-critical_ attitude necessary
to overcome it. In general, human beings
need to fight not only existing structures of
oppression, but also their capacity to produce
oppressive structures again and again. Not
only the oppressive conditions of life, but
also their own complicity in the oppression
of each other. To deprive them of freedom
is to deprive them of the precondition for
a responsible attitude towards what they are
and what they do.

All this is not meant to set up freedom
as one more panacea to replace other curealls,
but only to point out that in the difficult
task of transformation of human existence,
freedom is not just a glorious end that is to
be realised at the last (which in practice means
that it is indefinitely postponed), but is also
an instrument that aids the process. The
necessity of freedom to fight oppression is
of course well recognised, but the necessity
of freedom for the fight against oneself too
needs to be recognised. What is usually called
social transformation is also simultaneously
human transformation, which is partly at
least human self-transformation, and freedom
is a necessary condition for it. This still
leaves out a lot of problems and does not
answer the difficult question; what exactly is
the point at which the freedom of action of
religious and ethnic fundamentalists should
cease in the interests of human civilisation,
but at least it will serve to provide an understanding
that will distinguish progressive-minded
people from dictators when both of
them claim to worry equally about the misuse
of freedom by fundamentalists.

# INDIAN STATE'S 'GAME PLAN'

We can turn at the end to less controversial
matters, which are yet matters that have not
attracted sufficient response. This is what
the Indian state is doing in Kashmir in its
effort to bring the Kashmiris to their knees
(or their 'senses', as our newspapers say
euphemistically). Many will already put this
in the past tense, perhaps. By hook or crook
Kashmiris, it is already being said, have
been subdued and 'brought to their senses'.
The swearing in of the Farooq Abdullah
government is seen as the turning point.

What will happen in the future cannot be
said with certainty. The insurgency will no
doubt go on for a long time. Comparisons
with Punjab are self-deluding, for the feeling
for '_azaadi_' is much deeper in Kashmir. The
continuance of the insurgency will no doubt
be blamed on Pakistan by most Indians, and
certainly by our rulers. Pakistan's interest
in keeping Kashmir burning is no secret. Its
interest is without doubt as _mala fide_ as is
India's interest in Kashmir: territory, security,
national ego, and everything else except
what the Kashmiris desire. But if and to the
extent that insurgency keeps raging, the main
reason is going to be not Pakistan, but the
Kashmiris themselves. The statement
repeatedly made by India's politicians and
columnists, that the Kashmiris are tired of
militancy, is a half-truth. They are sick of
the endless sacrifice of lives and blood. They
are sick of the seemingly hopeless situation
in which they are caught. They are convinced
that they are only pawns in a larger battle
being fought by the world of Nation States,
in which their desire has the least priority
for everyone. They had hoped that either
Pakistan or the west or the UN would help
them achieve their goal: the simple
opportunity to decide how they would like
to live. But now they are convinced that all
these powers are interested in something
else. They were half hoping that India, which
always speaks in terms of the values of
'justice' and 'equality', would not be able to
stand up to the pressure of the sheer logic
of their case and the justice of their arguments.
But now they know that India has very brutal
answers in its arsenal to all their pleas of
justice, and all the impeccable logic of their
arguments. Kashmiris may be sick of
militancy, but they are much more sick of
this betrayal, betrayal of principles by India
and betrayal of faith by the other countries.
And what they are not sick of is their hope
to be free some day.

What we, as Indians, should be engaged
in is not the familiar amoral game of political
stargazing: what Pakistan will do, what the
US will not do, what Farooq Abdullah will
achieve, and what New Delhi will not allow
to be achieved, etc. We should be more
properly concerned with the brutal way in
which the present state of affairs has been
brought about in Kashmir, if we are, that is,
concerned about democracy and democratic
values as our first priority, and are principled
enough not to hedge our concern with tactical
'realism', or the kind of opportunism that
calls in its aid considerations of 'larger historical
issues' or 'the global political context'.

Very brutal suppression, of course, is the
answer, and there is no need to recount the
numerous instances of fake 'cross-fire'
killings or mass massacres of the people by
India's 'brave' _jawans_[^jawan]. But what needs to be
explicitly mentioned is the latest and the
most cynically efficacious means employed
by the Indian state in Kashmir, as part of
its 'game plan' (a Kashmiri Congressman's
words) to get through with the elections and
install an administration of Kashmiris in
Srinagar, to show the world that 'normalcy'
has returned to the valley. The replacement
of General Krishna Rao's administration by
an elected Kashmiri government was to be
made possible by the augmentation of India's
armed forces by armed Kashmiri surrogates:
not a statutorily established force of Kashmiri
policemen, but unlawful gangs of armed
Kashmiri youth, sheltered in or around the
ubiquitous bunkers of the armed forces, doing
their job of abduction, torture and killing,
but only more efficaciously, more
knowledgeably and more anonymously, and
looting and raping Kashmir withal. Unlike
the armed forces, which stay --- and need to
stay --- separate from the local society, and
operate in unwieldy and visible groups, these
local substitutes can (ideally) live within the
local society and act as anonymous
individuals. The ideal, of course, is spoilt
somewhat by the fact that when they are,
as in Kashmir, almost unanimously detested
by the public --- even by many men of the
Congress and National Conference --- they
cannot live and operate too far away from
their uniformed protectors, but nevertheless
the advantage of operating through
unlicensed local gangs is not slight. More
than the physical and logistic advantage is
the moral advantage: if Kashmiris kill
Kashmiris, some in favour of Pakistan and
some in favour of India, then what can poor
General Krishna Rao's administration do?
Or the army bosses in Srinagar's
Badamibagh, for that matter? But what they
should not be doing, and are evidently only
too plainly doing, is to protect, arm and
patronise one gang against another, and
openly abet their crimes in the "interests" of
the Indian state and its strategy of not allowing
the cession of the prized '_atut ang_' at any
cost. Nobody in Kashmir makes a secret of
the fact that it is this 'game plan' that has
made possible the terrorisation of Kashmiri
society to an extent sufficient to sap the
resolve of the Kashmiris and hold elections
successfully.

[^jawan]: An infantryman; a soldier.

"This Kuka Parrey's gang are of course
a bunch of criminals, but you just watch, it
is they who will make elections possible in
the valley": this gleeful comment of an
understandably bitter _pandit_ on his occasional
visit from Jammu back to his half blown-up
home in Srinagar, just before parliament
polls, is plain truth. One of the gang leaders,
a colourful character called Papa Kishtwari
alias Ghulam Mohammed Lone, put it with
embarrassing innocence when he said to a
visiting human rights activist that "it is my
gun that will make democracy possible in
Kashmir".

To privatise insurgency by introducing
protected surrogate criminal gangs is of
course not an idea invented by India's home
ministry. 'It is done everywhere', Indians
are quick to explain in justification, and
usually add (as if they have discovered the
piece of wisdom) that 'all is fair in war'.
Even some Kashmiris, the kind who are fair
even to the enemy, say the same thing,
though in tones of frustration and not glee:
'It is done everywhere, and we cannot blame
India alone'. Of course, it is done everywhere.
But presumably, we wish that it should not
be done anywhere. If it is unpardonable to
militarise a society in the name of tackling
an insurgency, then it is unpardonable a
hundred-fold to criminalise it.

But a criticism of the rulers that is not
accompanied by _self-criticism_ of the rebels
is of no use. Where the rebels are not prepared
for _self-criticism_, the criticism will have to
come from outside. It is no secret that the
Indian Army's _Rashtriya Rifles_, the counter-insurgency
wing that is described by Ghulam
Mohammed Magami, the Congress MP from
Srinagar, as a "gang of ruffians", which is
the premier agency for the recruitment of
the Kashmiri counter-insurgent gangs, has
found sufficient material to work on precisely
because of the methods of operation adopted
by the militant groups, and the problems
stemming therefrom. The recruits are almost
all criminalised former militants of the
various groups, or victims or kith and kin
of victims of the vengeful acts of violence
indulged in by the militant groups. Quite a
few are gangs of former militants who have
turned to the Indian army for protection,
having lost out to a rival group in violent
battles for supremacy. It is unlikely that
Kashmiris are unaware of the roots that
counter-insurgent criminality has in the very
methods of operation adopted by the
_mujaheddin_. But it is part of the silence that
accompanies weapons --- added perhaps to
a misplaced loyalty that does not allow
public criticism of the _liberators_ --- that
nobody in Kashmir is willing to locate
these uncomfortable sources. The _Hurriat
Conference_ leaders, otherwise intelligent and
rational men, maintain stonily that all the
recruits to what in Kashmir are called the
_renegade gangs_ were Intelligence _plants_
within the militant movement from the very
beginning, and there is therefore no question
of criminalisation of militancy to be
addressed when complaining about the
criminalisation of the state's counter-insurgency
strategies. This is, of course, a
hopeless abdication of the responsibility to
think self-critically.

But then that brings us to the responsibility
of Indians, at least those who claim to speak
on behalf of humanity and justice, to think
self-critically about our own silence in the
face of the government criminality.
Forgetting for the moment what is the proper
democratic attitude towards the Kashmir
issue, the counter-insurgency tactics being
adopted by India's rulers should, as a matter
of principle, cause serious disquiet. Physical
suppression supplemented by manipulation
with the help of local opportunists has always
been the government of India's only response
to the militant separatist struggles in the
border states, but the tactics of sponsoring
private pro-India gangs of armed local youth
is something qualitatively worse. It creates
an atmosphere of terror that is palpably more
intense than that induced by state lawlessness.
The Indian government has been doing this
systematically for the past few years in all
the border states. In the north-east it has
made use of ethnic divisions to evil effect.
That the insurgents of the north-east have
frequently provided scope for this is a
different matter. Everywhere the state has
dangled the temptation of safe crime to attract
local youth to its counter-insurgency tactics.
And there is enough criminality in any human
society for these wretched tactics to succeed.
The state's pact with them is that so long
as they do the required job of attacking the
partisans of secession --- armed or unarmed
--- the _gun-wielding militants_ or the
_intelligentsia_, or even _human rights activists_
such as the late Parag Kumar Das of Assam
or Jalil Ahmed Andrabi of Kashmir, they are
free to indulge in rape, loot and extortion
for their private profit. They can wreak
vengeance on their personal enemies, maim
them or kill them. It does not require much
imagination to realise that such state-sponsored
armed gangs can soon degenerate
into warlords above and beyond the reach
of the law. There cannot be a more vicious
abuse of the basic norms of lawful governance
than this wanton criminalisation of society.
To do this to a people merely because they
have asked for the right to leave this country
is an act of base cruelty. Suppression by the
military is a palpable degree less vicious. It
injures the people physically but does not
destroy the ethical integrity of their society.
Small wonder that sensitive Kashmiris
declare now that they hate India much more
today than they ever did in the past, even
in the past six years of reckless violence of
the Indian armed forces.

Will all of us speak up at least now and
protect a basic principle of democratic
governance from further degeneration? Or
are we content to let the Kashmiris, Nagas
and other people similarly situated hate us
for what our rulers have done and are doing
to them, satisfied that in the interests of
'secularism' and opposition to US hegemony.
their dreams of what they call freedom and
what we call secession are being effectively
contained?
