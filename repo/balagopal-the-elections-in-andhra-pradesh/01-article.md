_Happy days are here again for the class of touts, brokers and
middlemen --- the class that was first consolidated and shown a
place in the sun during Chenna Reddy's earlier incumbency as the
state's chief minister. The unusual joy with which he was
welcomed by the employees of the state secretariat was in part a
democratic reaction to the humiliation they suffered during NTR's
rule, but also in significant measure a thoroughly reprehensible
joy at the return to power of the man who institutionalised
corruption in Andhra, and structured a fine network through
which all concerned could make money._

The ruling classes' search for a way out
of the mess they have landed themselves
and the country in, has not even managed
to create a new political context for itself
with these elections. It is not just that the
_National Front_ has not swept the polls;
it would have been no different if it had.
That the 'Nehru model' needs updating/
repair/rejection, that the economy needs
some more opening up, and that it is no
longer very prudent to talk of land
reforms, are points that are accepted by
all sections of the ruling classes, though
some of them continue to pay obeisance
to old times for ideological reasons. But
that is where analysis ends. A more intelligent
and capable ruling class would
have at least generated some alternative
models and put them before the electorate,
but what we have had is a little more of
what we have been seeing for the last
decade: the unending search for a political
leader, party of formation that will hold
everybody together and propose an alternative.
These elections have not provided
even this much. Viswanath Pratap Singh
affects a tight-lipped manner, apparently
in the belief that still waters will be
presumed to run deep, but his silence
merely means that he has nothing to
say which Rajiv Gandhi has not said
before him.

What these elections have proved yet
once more is that the search for an alternative,
given the context of a completely
disillusioned and irreverent --- though, unfortunately
unorganised --- electorate, will
necessarily be a very violent one. The
various sections of the ruling classes are
jostling each other in the hurry to put
themselves at a vantage point in the
hoped-for restructuring of the national
consensus that is nowhere in sight. This
necessitates not only violent conflict
among themselves, but also a very violent
suppression of the masses, partly because
no section of the ruling classes knows of
any other way of convincing the masses
to go along with it rather than with the
others, and partly to stop the dangerous
possibility of the masses rejecting the proffered
framework and seeking an alternative
to it.

The visible strengthening of the opposition
and the weakening of the _Congress(I)_
does not represent any of the things it is
supposed to represent: the victory of
morality over corruption, of decentralisation
over centralisation, of democracy
over authoritarianism, of the 'Gandhi
model' over the 'Nehru model', of the
'rich peasantry' and the 'regional elite'
over the monopoly bourgeoisie, or of the
old bourgeoisie over the new buccaneers.
It is not that the _Congress(I)_ is not corrupt,
or that it is not authoritarian, or that
it does not believe in a centralised polity,
or that the new racketeering type of flashy
operators of the corporate world have not
got a very generous welcome from that
party. It is much more doubtful that the
_Congress(I)_ or its Nehru model have
exclusively or principally served the urban
capitalists as against the poor and oppressed
rural gentry and regional elite.
However, that is not the point at all.
The point is that what the opposition
represents is by no means what it professes
to represent. Its professions and protestations
are tailored to appeal to the
democratic sentiments of the masses.
Rural vs urban, small vs big, Gandhi vs
Nehru, are all polarities well suited for this
purpose. It is a myth diligently propagated
that these polarities define a new paradigm
about which anybody is at all
serious. The shape that the economy and
the polity were given in the fifties has long
since got entangled in a web, and while
the cutting of the threads of self-reliance
and state control has everybody's approval,
that tinkering has not satisfied
anyone. The Tatas and Birlas (about
whom some people are already getting
nostalgic) are as dissatisfied as the Nusli
Wadias and the Vijay Mallyas; and the
upstart rural and regional elite is as
dissatisfied as either of them. The ongoing
scramble is principally a rush to be at the
head of the field in the hunt for an alternative,
and secondarily a prudent desire
to loot as much as possible in the meanwhile.
If their own incapacity to produce
a single ruler capable of solving the problem
is the ruling classes' fault, the increasing
restlessness of the masses in the
interim is their misfortune. And yet, given
the compulsions of electoral democracy,
which they find prudent to stick to, not
because they believe in its liberal precepts,
but because in the first place the masses
will not accept anything less and secondly
because it provides the only feasible
framework for sorting out the differences
of as diverse a class as India's ruling class,
they must willy-nilly carry the masses with
them. And hence the all round violence,
both among the contending political formations,
and against the masses.

The poet Sri Sri, like most progressive
Andhraites of his generation, suffered
from a certain sense of pride in his Telugu
identity; he used to say that in all matters
of political significance, it is Andhra that
shows the way to the nation. Whether that
is necessarily a matter for celebration is
a bit doubtful --- for the path that the nation
has been traversing is not altogether
commendable --- but it is true that the
alignment of social classes, and the
politics of the ruling classes as well as that
of the most extreme opposition, has
exhibited itself most starkly in Andhra
Pradesh. If one counts out Bihar, where
electoral violence is no longer a matter for
comment --- no longer an abnormal mode
of political discourse, in currently
fashionable language --- the maximum
amount of electoral violence was seen this
time in Andhra Pradesh. About 32 persons
were killed on the day of the polling
and the next two days (one cannot be exact
because one has to make allowance for
rumoured dead bodies on the one hand
and likely coincidences on the other), and
about 19 died in pre-poll violence, ten in
intended murders and nine in the accidental
explosion of bombs that were meant
for killing other people. Among those
murdered were an independent candidate
in Raychoti in Cuddapah, and a polling
officer in the same district. Rigging was
so extensive that re-poll was ordered in
about 570 booths (this was announced
with an unbecoming but audible sense of
pride by the chief election commissioner,
Peri Shastry, who is himself an Andhraite).
The quantity of explosives the contestants
hurled at each other is beyond estimation.
The kind of terror this caused among the
public is new to Andhra politics. Everyday
during the month-long campaign ---
and more so on the days of polling and
counting --- people lived in a constant expectation
of a bloodbath. As the poll
results were expected to come out after 5
pm of November 26, both the public and
the shopkeepers at many places got ready
for an extended curfew. People purchased
what they would need two days hence, and
where they themselves did not think of
doing so, friendly shopkeepers urged the
precaution upon them. The worst affected
districts were Cuddapah, Kurnool and
Anantapur, where the conflicts of traditional
landlord gangs has in recent years
taken on the political form of intra-_Congress(I)_
or _Congress(I)_-TDP gang
fights, and the prosperous districts of
Guntur, Krishna, Prakasam, Chittoor and
the environs of Hyderabad, where the
recent phenomenon of vicious intra-elite
violence, and the violence of the vulgar
new rich against the _dalits_ has found most
lethal expression. Ministers, ex-ministers
and prospective ministers went around in
jeeps carrying tons of explosives and other
lethal weapons, supplemented by the rifles
of their officially sanctioned 'security
guards'. It was these 'security guards' who
contributed quite a bit to the violence; in
the execution of their duty of protecting
the lives of these ministers and ex-ministers,
they unwittingly became part of
the marauding gangs. Being trained and
permitted to open fire at the least excuse,
they were usually the first to score hits.

The 'mainstream' reaction to this
violence and to the general debasement of
the electoral process is quite interesting.
Most people would be outraged if one
compares this violence with Punjab or
with _naxalite_ violence. An unstated
presumption permeates the establishment
'common sense' that somehow this
violence is part of the natural order of
things, as indeed is all that is depraved and
vulgar about the ruling classes. Violence
is _kshatra dharma_, and all that one can
do about it is to ensure that one is not
around when the bombs are exploding.
This traditional Hindu attitude has been
reinforced in Indian politics by Gandhism,
whose precept of non-violence is addressed
to the masses and never to the rulers, and
forms a major impediment to any objective
discussion of the question of political
violence. Two hundred people killed in
Punjab in six months is a cause of much
horror, but an equal number killed in a
matter of a week in Bhagalpur in police
violence and in communal riots engineered
and inspired by the ruling class
parties merely causes regretful clicking of
tongues, as if it was an earthquake that
killed them. What really happened in
Andhra Pradesh on the day of polling
would never have been guessed by someone
who depended for his knowledge of
things upon the pronouncements of the
press and of men of public affairs,
throughout the one month prior to the
day of polling, a constant fear was
expressed that the _People's War Group_ of
the CPI-ML would render polling impossible
in Adilabad and Karimnagar
districts by attacking booths and killing
voters as well as poll officials. Brave
reports were written in the press declaring
somberly that _those who venture to
vote in those districts would be jeopardising
their limbs_. A large police force was
deployed in those districts to save
democracy from the 'extremists'. Exhortations
were made to the _People's War
Group_ not to employ violence on such a
'sacred occasion' as voting day. That group,
for its part, made life miserable for the
campaigning candidates by declaring large
areas out of bounds for them and setting
on fire the vehicles of those who ventured
into forbidden territory. But they did
nothing to harm or obstruct the people
who chose to go and vote, as indeed a
large number did even in the areas
strongly dominated by the _People's War
Group_, and voting day passed off in absolute
peace in the most feared districts
where all the police were deployed, and
all the violence happened where the police
were taken from, and that violence was the
doing of 'defenders of democracy' and
'non-violence'.

This hypocritical attitude towards
violence and 'extremism' exhibited itself
in another direction too. Two other CPI-ML
groups set up candidates in quite a
few assembly and parliamentary constituencies
in about seven or eight districts.
One seat, Yellandu in one of the 'disturbed
areas' of Khammam district, was earlier
held by a CPI-ML group, and Sirsilla, also
a 'disturbed area' of Karimnagar district,
was felt to be a stronghold of another
CPI-ML group. For quite a few months
prior to the election, the people of
Yellandu --- a mixed forest and coalmine
area, populated largely by tribals --- were
subjected to systematic assault by the
_Special Task Force (STF)_ policemen led by
an additional superintendent of police, one
Krishna Prasad, self-confessedly Vengala
Rao's man. The police warned them that
this time they should not vote for the CPI-ML
candidate but for the _Congress(I)_.
Every night for the whole week prior to
polling day the STF policemen, specially
trained to kidnap, torture and kill, went
around the constituency armed with self-loading
rifles and sten guns, dragging
people out of their homes, thrashing them
and threatening them with dire consequences
if their MLA won again. The SP
even challenged that he would discard his
uniform if the CPI-ML candidate won
again. On poll day the STF policemen,
armed with their ugly weapons, went
round the polling booths, a visible symbol
of terror to the tribal masses. Much
the same happened in Sirsilla in Karimnagar.
It was as if it was a contest between
the police and the CPI-ML. In the end,
to the chagrin of the police, both the
CPI-ML candidates won the elections,
frustrating the heroic efforts to save
democracy from the 'extremists' by the use
of brute force on the poor voters.

However, the hypocrisy is not confined
to violence. Money and country liquor,
which are a major means of mobilising
votes, are two other dimensions of the
debasement of the election process. And
the hypocrisy extends to these dimensions
too. It is not that this debasement is not
noted and condemned. But a studious attempt
is made to avoid drawing any conclusions
from it. The more obscene electioneering
becomes, the more it is idealised in principle.
The _right to vote_, from being a
political right of doubtful utility sold for
money or liquor, becomes an object of --- liberal
or feudal --- reverence, and a subject
for high --- liberal or feudal --- preaching.
Gun-totting goons and the newspaper
hacks who plead their cause for reasons
of pecuniary gain or political advantage
talk of the 'vote' in worshipful tones. The
English press invests it with liberal sentiments
whose place in Indian politics is
carefully never questioned, and the less
inhibited Telugu press describes the vote
as the _vajra_ or _pasupata_ weapon of
democracy with which the poor illiterate
voter (somehow the poverty and illiteracy
themselves acquire a mysterious power
when people say this) can fell the
mightiest ruler. Everybody knows today
that electoral democracy in India is merely
the optimal political framework for the
complex task of sharing out of the
nation's resources among the propertied
classes, and withal a legitimising seal for
the less-than-optimal option of gang-fights
whose purpose is again the same;
but then the more illegitimate the _raison
d'etre_ of electoral democracy becomes, the
more the 'vote' must be idealised and
mythicised. The reverence one exhibits for
the vote must be carefully severed from
any considerations of how it is being
mobilised or what use it has been put to
by those who have been favoured with it
in the past. That is the only way to ensure
that the vote is cast. This idealisation of
the vote has penetrated significantly into
popular consciousness, where it co-exists
with the people's perception of the vote
as a medium of self-expression: if you do
not like your MLA you may not be able
to do much about it, but you can at least
tell him off by voting against him.

But even so it is a mystery that in a
country where people so commonly say
about the ruling parties that 'all of them
are thieves', voting at election time continues
to flourish. Why people vote, and
why they vote for whoever they vote for,
is a very difficult question to answer. One
can evade the question by making
recourse to statistics, computers and the
sociological imbecility that has beset all
the social sciences, and indulge in macro-level
arithmetic analysis of 'swings' and
'waves', but the real question is a very difficult
one. There seem to be basically four
kinds of voting: rigged voting, mobilised
voting, politically conscious voting, and
the kind of voting that takes place because
everybody else is voting and there is
nothing much else you can do on poll day.
These different categories shade off into
each other at the edges. Mobilised voting,
for instance, is the kind of voting that
takes place through the distribution of
money or liquor, or when a local leader
or elder or a plain goon urges or commands
the people to vote for the candidate
he favours, it being imprudent to disobey.
This latter situation is not very different
from rigging. On the other hand a considerable
amount of politically conscious
voting takes place on the basis of loyalty
to a party or an individual, or as an opportunistic
_quid pro quo_ in exchange for
some benefits, and then it is difficult to
distinguish it from mobilised voting.
Equally, those who believe that they have
mobilised a large number of voters by
means of bribes in cash and kind may
discover that the votes have been cast
for someone else as an act of political
slap-in-the-face.

The point of saying all this is that it is
an arguable hypothesis that whereas
mobilised voting used to be the single
largest category in the early decades after
independence, it is gradually yielding
place to rigged voting on one side and
politically conscious voting on the other.
This is, by the way, another reason for the
increase in electoral violence. Elections
can be peaceful only so long as --- or to
such extent as --- the votes can be manipulated
and mobilised; the other two
situations require violence. The increase
in politically conscious voting means that
to that extent the people are consciously
casting their votes, though it is more often
against someone than for someone. That
this change should take place simultaneously
with an all-pervasive disgust
for not only the various ruling class
political formations but for the polity as
a whole is a seeming paradox. But all
paradoxes are only apparent: that is their
law. They merely serve to indicate an
unresolved contradiction, in this case that
the people are not able to perceive that
their vote is something that legitimises and
reproduces the polity which they find so
disgusting and repellent; instead they have
learnt to see the vote as a means of self-assertion,
a way of telling off those in
power. The realisation that the more enthusiastically
they turn out at election
time to vote out of power a corrupt or
authoritarian regime, the more they reinforce
the system that produces the corruption,
is something that is yet to penetrate
popular consciousness. Mere increase in
disgust will not bring about that awareness.
An alternative form of political
assertion --- assertion against the system as
such --- must take concrete form for that
to happen.

But in the meanwhile how effectively
the people have told off the whole lot of
them this time! Perhaps nobody has been
taught a more thorough lesson than NTR.
In history there is a type of ruler who has
the misfortune of acquiring a reputation
for invincibility in foreign lands. NTR is
one such person. His invincibility was
taken so much for granted outside AP
that it is doubtful that even the most
pessimistic of the _National Front_'s crystal-gazers
foresaw his defeat. But the invincibility
was a myth nurtured as carefully
by the press as Rajiv Gandhi's was by
Doordarshan and AIR. Without wishing
to equate state monopoly over the electronic
media with the conscious political
partisanship of the press, it must nevertheless
be said that the press --- not only
_Indian Express_ of great notoriety but
most of the Telugu Press too --- did a lot
to promote NTR's image as the undisputed
leader of the Telugu people. Proof
of his invincibility was seen even in his
ability to throw out from the cabinet and
the party everyone who disagreed with
him (what must be rankling him most
today is that all but one of them have now
come back to the assembly on Congress
tickets, and some have been made
ministers), and more proof of the same
was seen in his ability to dismiss his entire
cabinet one fine evening, go off to Delhi
for two days, and come back and reconstitute
the cabinet with 21 new faces. A
champion of democratic politics like the
_Indian Express_ then editorially expressed
awe at the man's 'grip' over his party, and
even those who criticised him for acting
with such arbitrariness nevertheless held
up his masterly control over the party affairs
as a commendable contrast to the infighting
in Rajiv Gandhi's party. The
sands were receding fast under his feet,
but they were all admiring his grip up
there. It was not merely the popular support
that was receding, even the class base
of the _Telugu Desam Party (TDP)_ was deserting
NTR in disillusionment. Ramoji Rao's
_Eenadu_, the authentic voice of that section
of the Andhra elite that created the
TDP, and the most faithful friend of the
class even when it criticised the party and
leader, as it did with increasing frequency
during the last year or so, gave out signals
of this desertion in the mute impartiality
that characterised its attitude towards the
election campaign, in sharp contrast to its
unbridled and vulgar partisanship during
previous elections.

For the rest the press was busy with that
inane vocation called psephology which
appears to think that if you know what
percentage of votes each party got in all
the previous elections, and if you are further
capable of adding three per cent of
subtracting five per cent in deference to
a 'wave' whose likelihood and direction
there is no way of knowing, then that tells
you all that you can ever know about the
coming elections. The Telugu press
evidently found this novelty very gripping,
for all possible information about percentages
of votes polled --- district-wise,
constituency-wise and booth-wise ---- was
collected and printed day after day. It does
not appear to have struck anybody as absurd
that so much effort and newsprint
should be expended trying to guess what
everybody would anyhow know in a couple
of weeks' time. The remarkably similar
way in which the press treats horse-racing
and elections must immediately strike
anyone with a sense of the incongruous.
As elections are supposed to serve a higher
purpose in a democracy than horse-racing,
the press would have served its readership
better if it had described the problems
raced by the people in each constituency,
and analysed the contribution of the past
governments, and the professions of the
present contenders, in solving those problems.
That the role of the press during
elections is to predict the outcome is a very
odd belief, but it comes next only to the
less odd but nevertheless unacknowledged
belief that the duty of the press is to egg
on people to vote for one party or the
other.

At the end of it all NTR lost rather
badly, and that repulsive breed of human
beings called Congressmen are back in
power at Hyderabad. There was a definite
shift of voters' preference away from him,
and all of it cannot be attributed to accident
or rigging. Rigging was extensive, but
all of them rigged anyway. Notwithstanding
all the righteous outrage about
Amethi, and notwithstanding Viswanath
Pratap Singh's studied projection of a
humble profile of low-cost and high
morality electioneering, the fact is that
they all spent huge amounts, and they all
rigged. But the voters just did not want
NTR and his 'friendly opposition parties'.
It would be insulting the people of
Andhra Pradesh to say that they actually
wanted the _Congress(I)_ back,but they had
no choice. The question of why NTR lost is
a meaningless question to those who
know how the state was being run. There
is no intelligible reason why he should not
have lost. His regime was as unresponsive,
inefficient and authoritarian as any
previous Congress regime. The vulgar
debasement of the Congress was replaced
by ludicrous aggrandisement and unseemly
antics. Corruption and favouritism
were kept intact, but centralised so much
that a large section of his own party was
dissatisfied. There is perhaps no other
party whose lower-level leadership
resented the top leader as much as NTR's
TDP. It was partly a just resentment at
his habit of treating them the way a police
officer treats his orderlies, but partly a less
reasonable resentment that all the graft
gets into the pockets of NTR and his sons-in-law,
and they don't get to even smell it.
The class of brokers, touts and middlemen
is a very important group in Indian
politics, and the Congress has survived
principally by satisfying each individual
one of them separately and adequately.
This class stretches all the way from village
and _mohalla_ leaders to chairmen of cooperative
and marketing societies, MLAs
and ministers, PWD and excise contractors,
and government servants in the
departments like civil supplies, excise,
revenue, forest and police. NTR managed
to create a lot of disaffection among these
people. As they would frequently put it
colloquially, 'the Congressmen would eat
and allow you to eat as well; this man
wants to swallow everything himself'. This
statement is not literally true, for many of
them made a lot of money in these six
years, but it is certainly true that NTR has
always exhibited a distinct distaste for
sharing the loot with others. The disaffection
of this class of middlemen did play
a role in bringing him down, and yet he
could not appeal to the people against
them because he was not fighting corruption
as such. Nevertheless, he would have
continued to get popular support if he had
done anything at all for the people. He did
just nothing, except to provide a certain
quantity of subsidised rice to some of the
poor, and a lot of free entertainment to
the newspaper reading public. Nothing
that involved any financial commitment
from the state government ever got approval
from him: recruitment for posts in
government departments and educational
institutions; enhancement of pay for
government servants or employees of
aided institutions; maintenance works for
roads or irrigation tanks; adequate
drought or flood relief; and so on. And
to top it all, his own inherent authoritarianism,
the fascist nature of the kind
of new rich class that forms his social
base, and the over-centralised administration,
combined to increase the importance
of the police during NTR's rule. The
general increase in police violence was so
much, and the autonomy given to the
police from civilian control was so total
during these six years, that 'police
excesses', from being a peripheral concern
of civil liberties groups, has now come
into the mainstream of the state's politics.

The 'friendly opposition parties' are
now saying 'I told you so', but they will
not say how much they themselves have
contributed to this state of affairs. Their
role in Andhra politics has been to
blackmail NTR and the people with the
threat of 'return of the Congress', and get
seats from NTR and votes from the
people, in return they have provided NTR
with a shameful respite from criticism and
exposure. The BJP, whose social base of
_brahmins_, _banias_ and the landholders of
the Telengana districts has little love for
NTR, would indulge in ridicule of his apparel
and antics, but took good care to
defend his regime; and come election time
it would snuggle up to him for seat
adjustments. The CPI(M) stuck to NTR
like glue, to the point of condoning every
misdeed of his, and exhibiting more
loyalty than his own party men in times of
internal crisis in his party. Everyone who
questioned NTR and got thrown out of
the party was dubbed a _Congress(I)_ agent,
and all criticism of NTR --- was dubbed
_Congress(I)_-inspired. The CPI behaved
likewise for a long time, but about a year
ago it turned around and started attacking
the TDP and _Congress(I)_ equally. For the
first time in its long exigence the party
was not running behind any ruling class
party. Instead, it cobbled together a Left
and Democratic Front consisting primarily
of itself and a few peripheral
organisations and discards from NTR's
party, and went round the state abusing
both TDP and _Congress(I)_ as reactionary
ruling class parties. Whatever the seriousness
and the sincerity of the leaders in
making this switch, its cadre, especially the
youth, were jubilant. For the first time
in many years they breathed an air of self-respect. For
communist cadre, there can be
nothing more suffocating than a tactical
alliance with a ruling class party, and
when such an alliance with one or the
other becomes a permanent feature, that
can have a stultifying effect on the cadre.
The spirit of liberation that the CPI cadre
must have enjoyed for more than a year
can be easily imagined. And when elections
were announced, the CPI declared
that it would go it alone and would not
have seat adjustments with NTR. But suddenly,
just a couple of days before the
close of nominations, the CPI leadership
did a total turn about and entered into
seat adjustments with NTR, and even put
up a high and successful bid. The party
cadre were furious, there were rumours of
manhandling of party leaders by the cadre
at the party's Hyderabad headquarters,
and many resignations from the party
followed.

Chenna Reddy is back in power at
Hyderabad. His victory does not mean a
defeat for the regional elite of AP, for it
is a false notion that the _Congress(I)_
represents exclusively or principally the
monopoly bourgeoisie, it does no such
thing. It is a principal achievement of the
Congress that it has always represented all
the propertied classes of the country,
though with a definite formula for the
running of the economy and the sharing
of economic resources and political power.
That formula is now well past its usefulness
for the ruling classes, and is
discredited and dishonoured. The NTRs
of the country have merely asserted this
demise without evolving a coherent alternative,
but NTR's defeat does not mean
that the pressure is to be written off; indeed,
even NTR himself cannot yet be
written off.

In the meanwhile Chenna Reddy is
going to do nothing to resurrect and bring
to life the old Congress formula; he would
regard it as beyond his limited mandate,
in any case. He will merely ensure that in
the interim looting of the country that
defines the current phase of Indian
politics, the section of the regional elite
that felt deprived during NTR's rule will
get their own back. Having castigated
TDP rule as '_kamma_' rule and campaigned
so long against it, he has packed
eight Reddy's into his 19-member cabinet.
This is no doubt meant merely as a gesture
of self-assertion, and others --- especially
the backward castes --- will be accommodated
in further bouts of cabinet expansion.

For the rest, happy days are here again
for the class of touts, brokers and middlemen,
the class that was first consolidated
and shown a place in the sun
during Chenna Reddy's earlier incumbency
as the state's chief minister. The
unusual joy with which he was welcomed
and escorted to his office by the employees
of the state secretariat --- the ceremony
resembled the return from exile of a
beloved raja --- was in part a democratic
reaction to the humiliation the employees
suffered during NTR's rule, but also in
significant measure a thoroughly
reprehensible joy at the return to power
of the man who institutionalised corruption
in Andhra, and structured a fine network
through which all concerned could
make money. This is the only social group
in Andhra that really loves Chenna Reddy,
and their days have truly come back
again.
