_It makes little sense to use the expression socialist freedom in the
same way as one uses the expression _bourgeois freedom_. There is
nothing specifically 'socialist' about the freedom sought by the
Chinese students nor about those promised by perestroika and
glasnost. If by 'socialist freedom' is meant the right to build a
socialist society or the freedom required for building such a
society then one can legitimately ask whether it is this freedom
that Lech Walesa or the Chinese students want or Gorbachev
desires to institutionalise._

\ 

There are two reasons for welcoming
Manoranjan Mohanty's detailed statement
of his position (June 17) on the
recent Chinese developments; one, that
it lifts the discussion to a meaningful
level from the cynical asides and snide
remarks that have constituted most of the
comments even in left circles; and two,
that those who read with a distinct sense
of disbelief his brief piece in _Frontier_
(June 25) are now assured that it is a
seriously held viewpoint. There are,
equally, two reasons for hesitating to react
to his analysis; one, that very few of us
can match Mohanty in his knowledge of
Chinese politics; and two, that the spirit
behind this reaction can easily be condemned
as belonging to that genre of
Marxism that 'will never learn anything'.
And yet, when the gap in the understanding
of persons all of whom equally profess
to be Marxists has grown so wide, it
is necessary that somebody puts aside all
hesitation.

Let us pose the issue in the form of a
few questions: (i) Is the contradiction between
the state and the people central to
the problems of socialism? And is it right
to understand the major issues in the
history of the socialist revolution
--- Stalinism, the Chinese cultural revolution,
Solidarity, perestroika and now
Tiananmen Square --- in terms of this contradiction?
(ii) Granted that the Chinese
students are fighting for some kind of
freedom within Deng's political system, is
that the same thing as fighting for
'socialist freedom'? More generally, do the
phenomena such as Solidarity in Poland
and perestroika in the Soviet Union represent
an aspiration for 'socialist freedom',
or do they, on the contrary, signify certain
natural consequences of the abdication
of the socialist ideal? (iii) Is it not a
species of double make-believe to first of
all accept the celebration of the market
and material incentives, consumption and
modernisation, as all part of 'socialism
anyway, and then hail the political and
administrative reforms that are either
demanded or necessitated as a consequence
of a new wind of 'socialist
freedom'? (iv) What is 'socialist freedom'?
Indeed, what is socialism, and what does
freedom mean in the context of socialism?
Is socialism merely a system that provides
a "greater possibility of the elimination
of multilateral domination", and that too
for the reason that it is led "by an
organisation committed to the cause of
the oppressed classes"? What happens if
this organisation starts believing --- or
professes to believe --- that socialism
can equally be achieved by capitalist
instruments ?

There can be no two opinions about
condemning the June 4 massacre. Killing
of unarmed people would be condemnable
even if they were counter-revolutionaries,
but as it is, Deng being the biggest
counter-revolutionary in China, it is
ridiculous to call his opponents by the
same name. Mohanty will perhaps disagree
with this, but we are at least agreed
on condemning the massacre. But this
agreement makes no material difference
to the questions raised above.

There is no point in seeking solutions
to the problems of Marxist practice outside
the framework of Marxism. Marxism
has always viewed socialism as a transitory
phase, a historical interregnum, that will
work towards the goal of communism, in
which all forms of oppression, inequality,
bondage and alienation will come to an
end. Even if we interpret this seemingly
teleological notion as an ideal, a vision
that we strive for the meaning of
socialism as a _continuously revolutionising
phase of history_ is not altered. Indeed,
there is no teleology here for the millennium
does not come at the end but is built
in the course of the interregnum. And it
has always been held by Marxists that this
transition cannot be effected by the _spontaneous
working of any formal structure_,
an impossibility that is not remedied by
attaching the label 'socialist' to the structure,
but only through the leadership and
guidance of the _revolutionary proletariat_.
It is necessary to emphasise the very real
difference between this and the liberal
political understanding, for it is here that
the real problem of democratic rights in
a socialist society lies. The idea of a conscious
and organised revolutionising process
as the vehicle of change is essentially
antithetical to the _bourgeois_ notion that
change is effected through the working of
institutions that reproduce themselves
through the actions of free individuals.
'The Invisible hand' _of_ an equilibrating rationality
is as central to _bourgeois_ political
thinking as it is to _bourgeois_ economic
theory. The _bourgeois_ notion _of_ freedom
is situated in this understanding of history,
and its claim to rationality as distinct
from its commendation on moral
grounds --- stems from this understanding.

This point, to repeat, is central _to_ the
concern of rights in a socialist society, and
for this reason it appears to make little
sense to use the expression socialist
freedom in the same way that one uses the
expression _bourgeois freedom_. There is
nothing specifically 'socialist' about the
freedoms sought by the Chinese students,
nor about those promised by perestroika
and glasnost. The freedom of association,
freedom of conscience, freedom _of_ expression
and the freedom of assembly are all
good old _bourgeois freedoms_, and so for
that matter is the people's right to have
a say in how they are governed. The last
of these rights was first guaranteed in the
Magna Carta ("scutage or aid shall be
levied in our kingdom only by the common
counsel _of_ our kingdom" says
chapter 12 of the Charter) and the rest of
them recur again and again in the history
of the English, American and French
revolutions. If citizens of the socialist
world are further driven by their existence
to claim protection against forcible
self-incrimination, double jeopardy ana
arbitrary detention and exile, then those
rights do not for that reason become some
superior thing called 'Socialist freedom',
for it was for these guarantees that the
English Lords and later the Commoners
fought their kings from John to James II,
literally ages ago.

On the other hand, if by 'socialist
freedom' Mohanty means the right to
build a socialist society or the freedoms
required for building such a society, then
quite apart from the fact that this freedom
is quite a different thing from what we
mean by freedom in _bourgeois society_; one
can legitimately ask whether it is this
freedom that Lech Walesa or the Chinese
students want, and whether it is such
freedom that Gorbachev desires to institutionalise.
Is that true? Do these 'new
winds' blowing across the socialist countries
seek freedom to do away with inequality,
oppression and multi-lateral
domination? Is this "the message of the
contemporary upsurge in the socialist
countries"? That seems a tall order. The
question is not whether they desire an end
to these inequities --- most people do, at
least when you interview them for a public
audience. The question is, when these
people use the expression freedom --- or its
institutionalised equivalent,  democracy
--- are they seeking the freedom and the appropriate
structures that will enable the
people of those countries to put an end
to inequality, oppression, and domination,
i.e., to build communism? One only
has to pose the question this way to realise
that the answer is in the negative. They
are demanding rights the same way that
people in western countries demanded
them a few centuries ago. It is not correct
to say that one should not describe as
_bourgeois_ every effort to win more rights
in a socialist country. If it is _bourgeois
rights_ that are sought then it is _bourgeois_
that one should call them, and the correct
point that one must then make is that
everything that is _bourgeois_ in its origin
need not be condemned. It can be legitimately
held, for instance, that the provision
of a _writ of habeas corpus_ is a must
in any civilised country, but it nevertheless
will remain a right won for civilisation by
the _bourgeoisie_, and will not get transmuted
into a socialist right by the mere
fact of a Wang Dan or a Xiong Yan
demanding it.

But let us pursue further the notion of
socialist freedom. The right to build an
egalitarian society is perhaps the one absolute
right in a socialist society (though
how it would translate into the kind of
prescriptive and justiciable rights that
alone are allowed the title 'Rights' by
_bourgeois jurisprudence_ is a moot point),
but what exactly are the freedoms that are
essential for the effective enjoyment of
this right, that are part of the "economic,
political and cultural conditions of liberation",
in Mohanty's words? For instance,
is it the freedom _of_ religion or the freedom
_from_ religion that constitutes a condition
of liberation? And what happens when
there is a conflict between the two? Or
--- thinking of, say, Salman Rushdie --- is it
the freedom to pursue the whims of one's
splintered and philistine consciousness
that is a condition of liberation, or the
freedom _from_ the splintering and alienation
of consciousness? And again, what
happens when there is a conflict between
these two freedoms? Or --- touching upon
a much-maligned aspect of the _cultural
revolution_ --- do we demand the freedom
to pursue unhampered one's profession _of_
being a seeker of scientific truth, or do
we desire freedom _from_ the professionalisation
of science? And this time we
know what happens when there is a conflict
between the two; Deng and the
Chinese student leaders --- in agreement on
this one point --- have been telling us what
happens. Indeed, they _are_ partly what
happens.

Freedom as understood in the socialist
sense is much more often 'freedom from'
than 'freedom of', which is not the same
thing as saying that socialism is inimical
to civil liberties. What it does say is that
the socialist concept of freedom demands
that we look at the question of civil liberties
in a socialist society in its own terms
and not in liberal terms. And it is essentially
a liberal framework that Mohanty
employs when he looks at the major issues
of the history of the socialist revolutions,
from Stalinism to Tiananmen Square, in
terms of the contradiction between the
state and the people, in terms of democratisation
and socialist democracy. It
must be emphasised once again that there
is no point in seeking solutions to the problems
of Marxist practice outside the
framework of Marxism. It is slightly
irritating to hear otherwise intelligent
people say that a repressive state apparatus
may be required for a few years
after the revolution, until all the enemies
are vanquished, but what is its need after
so many decades. If the enemies consisted
only of a handful of imperialist agents
and big landlords, then no repressive state
apparatus would be required even for a
few years. But there is a class enemy inside
each one of us, and the real problem is
how to drive that person out without doing
too much damage to ourselves. This
latter proviso is not a concession to the
self-appointed ombudsman called the west
but a real part of the problem, for the
'freedoms from' that Marxism seeks
include the freedom from torture, forcible
confessions, enforced conversion of
faith, etc., which were all rights won by the
_bourgeoisie_ from feudal rule. Marxism
regards the 'freedom from' an unequal,
alienated, oppressive and dehumanised
existence as primary, but it does not hold
other rights in contempt. Nevertheless,
there is a very real problem involved here,
and it is unlikely that the processes of
revolutionary transformation that constitutes
the historical task of socialism will
ever be a very pleasant one. It is evidently
no longer very fashionable to say that the
revolution is not a dinner party, but nevertheless
it is _not_ a dinner party.

From this perspective, the cultural
revolution, whatever else may have been
wrong about it, was not wrong because
it was a "centrally initiated campaign" nor
because it was "launched by one section
of the CPC leadership which was engaged
in a bitter political struggle with others".
Revolutions, as Mohanty does not need
to be told, are never conducted exclusively
from above or exclusively from below.
And a core concern of a revolution is
institutionalised power. If the recent
history of the socialist countries has any
message it is that this struggle for power
does not come to an end with the declaration
of a workers' state. In the continuous
struggle to end all inequality and oppression,
forces of resistance, forces of
counter-revolution, rear their heads again
and again, and the struggle against them
quickly turns into a struggle in the arena
of power, the arena of politics. This is a
much more appropriate understanding of
the cultural revolution than Mohanty's
reading of it as one attempt to resolve the
contradiction between the state and the
people. What is the material basis of the
forces of counter-revolution remains an
unanswered question, despite the vigorous
debate that followed the death of Mao
and the denunciation first of the Gang of
Four, then of the cultural revolution and
then of Mao himself, but that such forces
exist within revolutionising societies, that
_they_ do not suffer from illusions about
institutionalised power, is revealed in the
fact that in all the socialist countries it is
they who are now in power. The 'upsurge'
that Mohanty speaks of is situated within
this restoration, this counter-revolution,
and its evaluation must take place within
that context and not in an imagined context
of socialism. If, under such a dispensation,
the people want freedom of expression
and assembly, multi-candidate elections,
and the right to associate and
organise, the demands are entirely defensible,
but neither do the demands constitute
socialist freedoms, nor do those
who are in consequence killed by the state
become martyrs in the cause of socialism.

The real question of civil liberties in
socialist societies must be debated outside
the context of these 'actually existing
socialist' countries for the conditions of
the problem have been abdicated by them.
Let us forget those countries and think of
India. Any revolution in India, we all
agree, will have to fight the caste system
and caste values. Such a revolution will
in all probability claim for itself the
freedom to force upper caste bureaucrats
to work as _chaprasis_ to _harijan_ officers
at least a couple of days every week; it will
further claim for itself the freedom to
force all men to wait upon their wives; and
also the freedom to force intellectuals to
weed crops or carry dung; and the
freedom to force managers of factories to
work on the shop floor; notice what new
meanings the word 'freedom' has started
acquiring (perhaps _this_ is 'Socialist
freedom'?). But it will be argued that all
this must be done by the _harijans_, the
women, the carriers of dung and the
workers, and not by the state. Quite apart
from the fact that this still leaves the question
of civil liberties open, what happens
if the victims of these freedoms organise
themselves and resist the change, not in
the name of caste and patriarchy (they
would not be stupid enough to do so) but
in the name of religion, _dharma_, order,
progress, science, modernisation or
patriotism? These will not be just a handful
of class enemies against whom no prolonged
repression will be required, and
whom the unarmed masses can face and
vanquish. The defenders of religion, order,
progress and the nation will be from
among the masses themselves, frequently
from among the very masses whom the
revolution is to liberate. While a socialist
society cannot set about exterminating all
of them, and must concentrate on exposing
the illusory nature of the issues raised,
it cannot close the option of violence or
at least the threat of it except under
exceptional conditions of empathy between
the revolutionary masses and the
state. It is a suicidal brand of idealism to
believe that the revolution can ignore the
question of state power and leave it to
mass initiative to effect social transformation.
The revolution can only be effected
by a close combination of the masses and
their state, of education and compulsion,
of mass initiative and centralised leadership.
How to ensure that the basic civil
rights necessary for a dignified existence
are not violated even for those who
disagree with the revolution is a real question
that cannot be solved by wishing
away the dilemma. Till now Marxists have
generally believed that unlike capitalism
which reproduces itself through formal
institutions, socialism with its revolutionary
task can only work through a
heightened mass consciousness, awareness,
participation and political leadership.
It has implicitly been held that
institutionalisation of the instruments of
revolutionary transformation is impossible
or undesirable, except in the case of
the overarching guiding spirit, the party.
This understanding, which puts too much
of a premium on the prevalence of the
right spirit and attitudes in the party, has
been questioned off and on, and perhaps
it is time to open a debate on this matter
now, for such institutionalisation would
create space for civil rights appropriate to
socialism, without leaving them to the
benevolence of the party. The lack of such
an effort is painfully exposed when, in the
course of the continuous struggle between
revolution and counter-revolution that
defines the mode of existence of socialism,
the party either ossifies into a dehumanised
bureaucracy or, worse still, ceases to be on
the side of the revolution and becomes an
instrument of counter-revolution.
