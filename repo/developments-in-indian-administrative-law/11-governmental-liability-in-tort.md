# GOVERNMENTAL LIABILITY IN TORT

Nearly thirty years after Independence, the Indian legal system has yet to find an adequate answer to the question of the liability in tort by governmental actions. Not merely has any legislative solution been attempted to solve the problem of compensation for injuries caused to Indian citizens out of the routine activities of governmental agencies, but also the government has usually put forth the defence of sovereign immunity whenever compensation claims have been pressed, as if the directive principles and the preamble to the Constitution did not exit! The courts too have been confronted with a decision made by the Calcutta Supreme Court in 1861![^130] Under that ruling "there is a clear distinction between acts done in the exercise of ... Sovereign power, and acts done in the conduct of undertakings which might be carried on by private individuals without such powers delegated to them".[^131] Indian courts have yet to repudiate this distinction, although they have bypassed it or manipulated it in a large number of cases, in favour of the victim of injuries caused by State operations. In 1962, deciding the question of the liability of the government for the reckless and negligent driver of a government vehicle which fatally injured a pedestrian, the Supreme Court ruled that in a "Republican form of Government" with an avowedly socialistic Constitution "there is no justification, in principle, or in public interest, that the State should not be held liable vicariously for the tortious acts of its servants."[^132]

The promise of this decision was somewhat dissipated in 1965 when the court held that the theft of gold kept in police custody on suspicion that it was stolen property did not establish a claim for tortious liability since under the 1861 "precedent" the State cannot be held liable, law and order activities being an aspect of the sovereign function. This decision has been, rightly, criticized by juristic writings[^133] and seems to have had little adverse impact on the High Courts, which have almost consistently denied attribution of sovereign function to diverse governmental activities such as use of military vehicle for carrying sporting teams of the Indian Air Force,[^134] or transportation of records and equipment or[^135] overflowing of a reservoir constructed by the State.[^136] In a recent decision, the Supreme Court also negatived the plea that famine relief was a sovereign function and therefore no compensation was due to the widow of a pedestrian run over by a defective truck used in the relief operations.[^137]

What is striking in this situation is that the State should be contesting such matters as far as the Supreme Court of India and that the courts, while giving relief, should still be nominally adhering to, rather than expressly repudiating, the 1861 test distinguishing between sovereign and non-sovereign functions, so uncontemporaneous today. The very first report of the Indian Law Commission in 1956 urged legislative abolition of this distinction and courts have repeatedly endorsed this recommendation. A bill introduced in 1965 lapsed in 1967; since then Parliament has not found this item to be one deserving high priority on the legislative agenda. It is much to be hoped that the Supreme Court of India, without waiting for any further legislative action, bids farewell to this colonial doctrine, making it difficult for citizens of India to claim compensation for injuries they suffer as a result of the growing volume of State activity in all domains of Indian life.
