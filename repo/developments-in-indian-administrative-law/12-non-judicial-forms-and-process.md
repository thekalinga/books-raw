# NON JUDICIAL FORMS AND PROCESSES FOR ACCOUNTABILITY IN ADMINISTRATION

It is only at the very end or their massive commentary on developments in Indian administrative law that two widely read authors acknowledge that as a “control-mechanism, courts play only a marginal role” Judicial control “of administrative action”, they conclude, is helpful to the extent it is available. But that extent is severely limited by several factors surveyed so far.[^138] As a result, the contest between the government and the individuals becomes a very unequal one” and a large number of public grievances against the administration go unrectified”.[^139] This informed conclusion bears out the view expressed at the beginning of this paper that the judicial process has not given its self-denying ordinances and the politics of accommodation of power between executive and judiciary, much to offer by way of structural solutions to the everyday excesses of power by the administration.

By the same token, the non-judicial methods of ensuring accountability in administration are also not successful at the structural level in generating an ethos of legality in administration. These include: the legislatures (and their specialist committees), the party political process, the investigative and enforcement agencies and the media as a shaper of public opinion on priorities for political action. Any generalization on their overall effectiveness requires close empirical examination of the processes and structures through which accountability in various senses of that term) is sought to be ensured. Available literature, supplemented by intuitive understanding, indicates only general even if tentative conclusions.

In terms of redressal of grievances against the administration, political processes appear to be doing as good, if not better, job as judicial control. Access to a political personage (M.P. or a member of a state legislature or a party official) does often bring positive results for people concerned. Through kinship and ethnic networks, access to such sources appears extensive but even so access to political personages by a large mass of grievance-inflicted citizens seems very limited.[^140] Media—mainly newspaper and periodicals—have played a useful role in settlement of individual grievances though their grievance columns; but the system of newspapers ombudsmen has not yet been carefully studied in India. Apart from grievance columns, however, the media priorities do not so far involve investigative journalism related to individual grievances. Investigative and enforcement agencies are responsive to grievances of people with high socio-economic status. Correspondingly, senior officials are broadly more responsive than the grassroots ones to demands for investigation and enforcement in matters affecting individuals. But it remains true that the only effective method of mobilizing enforcement agencies is the Gandhian one of direct, non-violent action. This is most often employed by change-agents and movements on the countryside in a wide variety of contexts involving abuse and non-use of public powers (e.g. when police refuse to register cases against the local notables mainly the rural rich).[^141] But resort to direct action to correct abuses of power or generate compliance with the law or the use of discretionary power by officials also extends now to urban areas.[^142] Even so, the method of direct action has been used only episodically, for a variety of reasons, as a control mechanism over the administration.

As distinct from grievances involving specific cases and individuals, the abuse of power in the form of corruption has been high on the national agenda. There is, of course, as Gunnar Myrdal pointed out, not just the fact of corruption but a folklore about corruption.[^143] These two levels of corruption, as it were, mutually reinforcing each other add further complexities to the problem of understanding corruption as an aspect of political and governmental process in a developing society, the bulk of whose people live beyond a niggardly axed poverty line. But for our present purposes corruption may be perceived as a kind of administrative deviance or abuse of power. While illegal gratification is an offence under the Penal Code, and there is a special law called the Prevention of Corruption Act, the small number of prosecutions under both indicates the inability of people to mobilize the law to correct the abuse of power and the posture of the legal system which provides disincentives for such pursuits by people.[^144]

The legislative processes and the media have played a comparatively more decisive role in exposing corruption in high and low places than they have in dealing with grievances of individuals and groups exposed to excesses of powers or non-performance of public duties. The impact of these efforts is rather hard to measure. The use of the Commissions of Enquiry Act, 1952 with a view to find facts, has been the standard response of governments to exposes of corruption. However, it is notorious that the Commissions of Enquiry is fact-finding bodies and no more) are usually mobilized by incumbent politicians against opponents who are out of office; and even so, very little enforcement action follows in the wake of the Commission reports.[^145] There exists at the Centre, and in some States, the Vigilance Commission. The Central Vigilance Commission, an outcome of the highly frank and disturbing Santhanam Committee Report in 1962, is established by a Cabinet Resolution and its main brief is to exercise vigilance over civil servants and public undertakings. It advises the government concerning disciplinary action against civil servants and in regard to grants of prosecution in cases investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation.[^146] Not much empirical literature exists to justify any worthwhile conclusions concerning the effectiveness of the Commission.

The Ombudsman idea has had a chequered career in India so far.[^147] But it has taken legislative shape in as many as five Indian States in the period 1970-1975, and legislation was pending, as in 1975, in at least two more States.[^148] At the Union level, a bill to introduce the Lokpal (Hindi equivalent of Ombudsman) introduced in 1969, lapsed owing to the dissolution of the Lok Sabha; another bill was introduced in 1971 and yet another in 1977, both of which have now lapsed. One can, in the circumstances, only refer to the conceptions of Lokpal in the existing legislations and bills and the experience of the working of the institution in some States.

Under the 1971 Bill, followed in some States, the Lokpal had the jurisdiction to examine “grievances” as well as “allegations”. The latter were defined to refer to corruption involving “personal interest, or improper or corrupt motives” in the discharge of public functions, and lack of integrity or improper conduct in his capacity as a public servant”). The former relates to claim that a person has “suffered sustained injustice or undue hardship in consequence of maladministration”. “Maladministration” has been defined in terms of practices, procedures, and actions which are “unreasonable, unjust, oppressive or improperly discriminatory” or as involving “negligence” or “undue delay”. Grievances can be brought before the Lokpal by anyone affected by maladministration; “allegations” could be made by any person who is not a civil servant. Complaints were contemplated under the bill against a wide range of persons including all Ministers (barring the Prime Minister of India) and all other departments, companies, statutory corporations under the Union government.

In contrast, the 1977 Bill does not clearly maintain the distinction between “corruption” and “maladministration”. It takes as its focus *misconduct” by “public men” the definition of “public men” does not include the bureaucracy. The 1977 Bill further provides that the Lokpal has no jurisdiction over matters pending before the Commissions of Enquiry; this gives the government an option to make a preemptive strike by referring a matter likely to come before the Lokpal to Commission. The Lokpal, under the 1977 Bill, is open to the charge of bias. Such a charge is to be resolved by the President after obtaining the opinion of the Chief Justice of India. This clause could result in demoting the status, and interfering with the functioning, of the Lokpal.[^149]

The main point is that the Ombudsman idea in India is currently more centred on corruption than on redressal of grievances against the administration. This is an important shift but one that is likely to continue to leave the citizen short-changed. Indeed, it has been said that the present conception of the Lokpal, in the 1977 Bill, means that the institution will no longer be used to make the day to day administration more amenable, human and humane” and that it is primarily designed to be used as a weapon in political warfare among professional politicians.[^150]

It appears that the 1971 model has influenced the conception of Lokpal in at least six States; the 1977 model is manifest in two or three States.[^151] On available information for Maharashtra, the Lokpal has handled a considerable number of grievances;[^152] lawyers have been heavily involved in complaints “as supporting affidavits are required in most cases”.[^153] The Lokpal in Maharashtra has been engulfed in acrimonious political controversy as well.[^154]

It would appear from all this that the non-judicial means of redressal against abuse of power or administrative deviance are as tenuous and weak, structurally, as the judicial ones. The steady expansion in administrative powers has not been accompanied by a similar expansion in accountability. Herein lies a major facet of the crisis of the Indian legal system, and the underlying ideology of legal liberalism.[^155]
